title: Facilitating content generation via messaging system interactions
abstract: The following disclosure relates generally to techniques for generating useful content based on user interactions, such as by enabling users to submit questions to and otherwise interact with an answer-providing service. In some situations, one or more interfaces are provided to allow users to specify a variety of types of questions for the answer-providing service, such as via a GUI and/or using a messaging interface based on email or other types of electronic messages. When communications occur via electronic messages, the answer-providing service may in some situations generate and include unique tracking identifiers in electronic messages sent to users, so that the users can reply back to the messages in order to provide a command to the answer-providing service that includes a tracking identifier previously sent to the user and thus verify that the command is sent by someone with access to the electronic messages of the user.

This application claims the benefit of provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60 784 533 filed Mar. 20 2006 and entitled Content Generation Via Messaging System Interactions which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This application is also related to co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 396 342 filed concurrently and entitled Facilitating Content Generation Via Paid Participation to co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 396 413 filed concurrently and entitled Content Generation Revenue Sharing and to co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 396 316 filed concurrently and entitled Facilitating Content Generation Via Participant Interactions each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The following disclosure relates generally to techniques for generating useful content based on user interactions such as by enabling users to submit questions to and otherwise interact with an answer providing service via email or using other messaging systems.

A common problem that arises is to quickly and cheaply find accurate and useful information of interest such as answers to a wide variety of types of questions. As a result a variety of information sources and other ways to locate information of various types have been developed but they are often time consuming and or expensive to use as well as having other problems such as providing only limited types of information providing information that is inaccurate and or irrelevant etc. For example encyclopedias and reference librarians may provide one possible source of answers but can be time consuming and expensive if they are even available and are limited in the types of information to which they have access such as to historical and other reference information of mass interest. Similarly while online search engines more recently are available to provide information of various types they often provide information that is inaccurate or irrelevant are difficult or impossible for many users to effectively use and are also similarly limited in their ability to retrieve various types of information. For example such information sources may be ineffective in providing answers to many topical and special interest questions such as a list of restaurants of a particular type in a given geographic location that have provided great service during the prior month suggestions on how best to use particular features on a particular new digital camera that was recently released or an identification of a physical store in a geographical area that currently have a particular item in stock at a price that satisfies specified criteria.

Other examples of sources of at least some types of information include email lists and newsgroups that are devoted to highly specialized topics which may allow people to ask questions and later receive responses related to those topics. However such lists or newsgroups typically do not exist for many subjects of interest and may be difficult or impossible for infrequent users to identify if they do exist. Even if an appropriate list or newsgroup exists and a user with a question locates it it may be difficult for many users to submit questions in a form that is acceptable to specialized culture of the list newsgroup and responses from others may take days if they occur at all and may be hard to find among other activity on the email list or newsgroup. Moreover such responses are often inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate since there is typically no feedback mechanism to identify reliable and experienced users or to penalize users who intentionally or otherwise provide inappropriate responses and there is typically no monetary or other reward to incentivize the most experienced and diligent users to participate and provide accurate information. In recent years specialized answer services have developed on the Internet which may allow questions over varying ranges of topics to be submitted and answered by paid employees or affiliated researchers but typically suffer from at least some of the same drawbacks as email lists and newsgroups e.g. limited to only certain topics responses are slow responses may be inaccurate little or no incentives for the most experienced users to provide the most accurate and useful answers etc. and may further be costly to use.

Thus it would be beneficial to provide a solution that enables people to easily find information of interest e.g. answers to questions such as to quickly and cheaply obtain accurate answers to questions on a wide range of topics.

Techniques are described that facilitate generating useful content based on user interactions such as by providing an answer providing service that facilitates interactions between users who supply questions and users who supply responses to the questions of other users as well as using the generated content in various ways. In at least some embodiments one or more interfaces are provided to allow users to specify a variety of types of questions for the answer providing service such as via a graphical user interface GUI from a Web site of the answer providing service and or using a messaging interface based on email or other types of electronic messages. Various users of the answer providing service may then view supplied questions and rapidly provide responses with the responses of multiple users being aggregated or otherwise combined to generate answers for the questions in at least some embodiments. In at least some embodiments the response provider users who provide responses to questions are unrelated to the question requester users who provide the questions and both sets of users may be unrelated to the answer providing service other than being registered for the purposes of making question requests and or providing question responses.

In at least some embodiments users may be compensated and otherwise incentivized for participating in interactions with the answer providing service in various ways. For example one or more response provider users who each provide one or more responses for use as part of an answer to a question from another user may in at least some embodiments be rewarded in a manner specific to the question and their response s such as to split a total amount of monetary reward for the question between the response provider users and or to split experience points related to the question between the response provider users. In addition in at least some embodiments a portion of an ongoing revenue stream that is later generated from or otherwise associated with the answer may be shared with the response provider users who provided the responses. As discussed in greater detail below the splitting of a monetary and or experience point reward for responses to a question between the response provider users who provided the responses may be performed in various manners in various embodiments including based at least in part on the uniqueness of the provided responses and or other measure of the usefulness of the provided responses e.g. based in part on feedback from the requester user who supplied the question and or other response provider users who provided responses to the question . Similarly as discussed in greater detail below the sharing of an ongoing revenue stream related to an answer may be split between the response provider users who provided the responses used in the answer in various manners in various embodiments including based on assessed levels of expertise of those response provider users e.g. as may be measured using a relative amount of experience points allocated to those users based on previously submitting responses to questions . In addition in at least some embodiments the response provider users with the highest levels of expertise and past participation e.g. as may be measured using previously allocated experience points for those users are incentivized to continue participating by assigning one or more enhanced incentive levels to at least some such users and then providing additional benefits of various types to users having such enhanced status e.g. to increase the amount of ongoing revenue stream share of an enhanced status user such as by extending the amount of time that the revenue stream share occurs to provide additional types of functionality to facilitate responding to questions such as by providing notifications to enhanced status users of supplied questions meeting specified criteria etc. . Various other techniques may similarly be used to incentivize high quality responses and the continued participation of the most valuable users in at least some embodiments as well as to generate types of content other than answers to questions as discussed in greater detail below.

In at least some embodiments answers may be categorized in various ways and for various purposes such as to allow users to easily locate and or access previously answered questions in a particular category and to assist in tracking and evaluating the expertise of response provider users in a manner specific to particular categories. In some embodiments the categorizing of an answer is performed based at least in part on input supplied by the requester user who supplied the question associated with the answer and or on input supplied by the response provider users who supply responses used as part of the answer. For example in some embodiments a requester user who supplies a question may indicate one or more tags related to the question and those tags may be used as user designated categories for the question and its subsequent answer e.g. as part of a group of free form categories that are incrementally developed based on user input . Subsequently the one or more categories for a question from the requester supplied tag s may assist response provider users in identifying the question as being of interest to answer. In addition response provider users may supply one or more other tags for the question and its answers which similarly may be used as user designated categories e.g. by selecting one or more of the most popular tags supplied by all of the response provider users . Categorizing of answers may further be based in at least some embodiments by comparing answers and their constituent responses to the answers of other questions such as to cluster or group similar answers and to combine or otherwise group related tags or other category information for answers that are sufficiently similar. Such grouped or otherwise related tags and other category information may further be used in various manners in various embodiments such as to suggest appropriate tags to requester users and or to response provider users based on the suggested tags being related to user supplied tags and or other information associated with an answer e.g. text of the question corresponding to the answer . Additional details related to categorizing of answers are included below.

In some embodiments other users of the answer providing service may provide information that is related to specific questions and answers such as by allowing item provider users e.g. representatives of merchants to pay in order to have their responses or other information e.g. advertisements included in the answers of questions that the item provider users select such as part of a pay per response functionality in which an item provider user affirmatively responds for each question of interest that indicated information is to be included in the answer for the question before the item provider user is charged for the information inclusion. While the item provider users who pay to include information in answers for selected questions are typically distinct from the response provider users who are compensated or otherwise rewarded for providing responses for questions in some embodiments there may be overlap between groups of users such that a single user performs multiple roles at different times e.g. to at times act as a requester user as a response provider user as an item provider user on behalf of one or more item providers and as a viewer user . Such items may include products services and or information that are available for purchase rent lease license trade evaluation sampling subscription to etc. whether from a physical brick and mortar merchant at a particular geographical location or from a Web store of an online merchant or another type of electronic marketplace e.g. for electronic ordering and delivery via appropriate physical distribution channels or electronically as appropriate such as shipment via a governmental postal service or private common carrier for physical products or such as via download over the Internet for digital products such as digital music videos or e books . Correspondingly the item providers provide such items to others and may include product oriented and or service oriented businesses or other organizations or entities with an item provider user being a user who is a representative of an item provider or who otherwise acts on behalf of an item provider. In particular in some embodiments an item provider user may indicate criteria of interest for use in automatically identifying matching questions and a specified bid or other monetary amount for use with pay per response functionality such that the item provider user desires to receive an option for each of the matching questions to provide a response in exchange for payment from the item provider user of the specified monetary amount if the item provider user so elects. Question matching criteria may be specified in various ways including keywords to match tags and or categories that are associated with an answer or its corresponding question before the answer is generated or to instead match other information associated with a question answer such as to directly match the question content e.g. the text of the question and or to match metadata related to the requester user who provided the question e.g. the geographic location of the requester user and or one or more response provider users who respond to the question in other than a pay per response manner. When a given question matches previously specified criteria of one or more item provider users at least some of the one or more item provider users that specified the criteria may each be notified of the question as well as possibly an option to provide a response to the question in exchange for payment e.g. a monetary amount that was previously bid or offered by the item provider user . Additional details related to actions of item provider users and pay per response functionality are discussed in greater detail below.

In this example the Rapid Answer system and the revenue generation system are both provided by the same entity as part of the systems of that provider and the systems may in some embodiments contain additional systems or components that are not shown such as a payment system or systems for other services. Various messages may occur between the illustrated systems and users and may be performed in various ways in various embodiments e.g. in an interactive manner based on one or more GUIs of the Rapid Answer system based on an exchange of messages using email or other types of electronic messaging such as IM instant messaging SMS short message service or MMS multimedia messaging service in a programmatic manner based on electronic communications sent via one or more APIs application programming interfaces such as based on Web services etc. .

In addition to supplying question requests requester users may each further interact with the Rapid Answer system in various ways in at least some embodiments such as by receiving answers to their questions providing feedback related to the answers e.g. to provide positive or negative feedback related to particular responses and or response provider users and viewing information about a user account of the requester user with the Rapid Answer system.

In addition to supplying responses to others question in exchange for compensation or other rewards response provider users may each interact with the Rapid Answer system in various ways in at least some embodiments such as by identifying supplied questions of interest that are not yet answered e.g. questions in categories in which the response provider user has expertise or would like to expand their expertise providing feedback related to questions and answers e.g. proposed tags or other category information for questions to which they are responding positive or negative feedback regarding responses and or proposed tags categories of other response provider users etc. and receiving a share of ongoing revenue streams generated for questions to which they previously responded.

In addition to paying to include information in answers to questions that are individually selected item provider users may each interact with the Rapid Answer system in various ways in at least some embodiments such to designate categories or other criteria related to questions for which the item provider user desires an opportunity to elect to provide a response or other information in exchange for a designated payment e.g. questions related to items that the item provider user sells or otherwise provides receive notifications of options to respond to particular questions and to optionally respond to those questions in exchange for designated payment from the item provider user and provide payment of money or other items of value to reflect elections by the item provider user to provide responses for particular questions. Item provider users may be distinguished from response provider users in various ways including that item provider users may pay to provide responses to others questions whereas response provider users may be paid or otherwise rewarded e.g. by obtaining experience points for providing responses to others questions.

Viewer users may each interact with the Rapid Answer system in various ways in various embodiments such as by accessing and viewing previously answered questions of others that may optionally be accompanied by advertisements. Advertisers may include the actual parties on whose behalf the advertisements are shown as well as brokers or other intermediates who act on behalf of others e.g. via affiliate programs or by acting as a service that sells advertising and may similarly each interact with the Rapid Answer system and or a related system e.g. a revenue generation system in various ways in various embodiments.

For illustrative purposes some embodiments are described below in which various specific types of content are generated in various specific ways based on specific types of interactions with users such as by providing incentives to encourage response provider users to provide answers to questions by providing pay per response functionality in which item provider users pay to provide responses to questions and by categorizing answers in various ways to facilitate access by various users. However it will be understood that the described techniques can be used in a wide variety of other situations and that the inventive techniques can be used in a wide variety of other situations including to generate other types of contents based on other types of interactions with users.

In at least some embodiments when a time limit is specified by a requester user the Rapid Answer system may take various actions to provide an answer within that time such as to close availability of the question to additional response provider users and responses near or at the end of the time limit even if fewer than a predetermined or requested number of responses have been received or if fewer than a predetermined e.g. 10 or requested number of response provider users have responded. In addition a requester user may be able to offer a reward for an answer to a submitted question in various ways in various embodiments such as to specify a monetary amount to be paid and or an amount of Rapid Answer system points to be provided or instead each question may be assessed an amount of money and or a number of points by the Rapid Answer system e.g. with the reward for each question being the same or with the reward instead varying based on the categories for the question and or other information related to the question . As discussed in greater detail below a reward that includes Rapid Answer system points may provide various types of benefits to response provider users and a requester user may obtain such points to be provided in various ways e.g. by receiving a specified amount of points for free such as an initial allocation or a recurring number of points for each successive specified time period by purchasing them for monetary payment by earning them based on other activities of the requester users etc. In addition in at least some embodiments both the question and the summary may be limited to a predetermined number of characters e.g. 959 characters for the question and 85 for the summary and a summary separate from the question may not be used in at least some situations e.g. if the question text is sufficiently short . Additional information may also be supplied or specified in some embodiments such as a geographic location of the requester user or criteria related to which response provider users provide responses e.g. specified desired or required qualifications of the response provider users such as an experience level or other qualification an indication that the response provider users have previously performed some indicated task or action such as to have answered indicated related prior questions etc. and or how the answer for the question is to be generated. Requester users may in some embodiments make the reward dependent on the time to obtain an answer such that the requester user pays a premium to have the question answered sooner rather than later.

In some embodiments the requester user who asked the question may view responses as the responses are incrementally received by the Rapid Answer system while in other embodiments the response information is not provided to the requester user until the question has been fully answered i.e. all responses to the question have been received and any aggregation or other processing of the responses has been completed . In embodiments in which other users may view such answers such as a viewer user the displayed information may be similar but may lack some details such as the ability to provide feedback about the answer or to incrementally receive responses as they are received. In addition in at least some embodiments users other than the requester user who submitted the question may only obtain information about the question and its answer after the answer has been completed such as to prevent potential or actual response provider users from obtaining information about responses provided by other response provider users. Furthermore in some embodiments at least some requester users may receive only a single response to a submitted question such as the only response that is supplied by a single response provider user or instead a single response that is one of multiple responses supplied by one or more response provider users such as one response that is selected as the best or that is otherwise preferred over the other responses based on specified criteria e.g. the first response received by the Rapid Answer system the response from the response provider user with the highest enhanced status the response for which an item provider user is willing to pay the most and or for which a response provider user is willing to perform for the least reward etc. .

In some embodiments various additional types of information sources or other types of responses may be provided and the Rapid Answer system may further assist response provider users in various ways such as by indicating potentially helpful Web sites e.g. based on URLs from previous answers with the same or similar categories or based on being generally useful reference sites . In addition in some embodiments a response provider user may be able to reserve a phone number e.g. for use as a response to the current question such as while the response provider user is preparing additional response information for the current question or instead for future use with other responses such as if a particular phone number may only be submitted by one response provider user for each question in some embodiments. In this example embodiment the Rapid Answer system also allows response provider users to ask for clarifications from the requester user who submitted the question such as if the requester user left out important information or if the question is too broad to be reasonably answered and any clarifications received may be visible to all actual and or potential response provider users.

Although in this example space is provided for one URL and or one phone number in some embodiments a response provider user may be able to supply multiple URLs phone numbers and or other sources of information such as other types of contact information e.g. street and or mailing addresses e mail addresses etc. . Furthermore in some embodiments a response provider user may need to provide his her entire group of multiple responses to the question together at a single time while in other embodiments the response provider user may be able to submit responses at multiple times. In addition in some embodiments the responses may need to be formatted in specific manners such as to format a phone number as in such embodiments an example may be provided and or client side scripting e.g. JavaScript may be used to dynamically monitor and optionally modify a response so that it is in the correct format. In some embodiments the Rapid Answer system may similarly restrict some responses for various reasons e.g. to restrict inappropriate answers such as to not accept aliased URLs that will redirect a browser to a different URL. In addition the system may have various security measures to prevent spamming of responses with off topic advertisements or other responses.

While not illustrated here in some embodiments response provider users may provide responses that utilize additional types of content such as various forms of multimedia content e.g. images audio video etc. active content e.g. implemented by the use of applets plug ins scripts or other executable code and or links to or other indications of content e.g. a URL link instructions for locating obtaining the content access information for use in obtaining access etc. provided by one or more sources external to the answer providing service of the Rapid Answer system. Various technologies may be utilized to provide such functionality including but not limited to JavaScript Java Applets Macromedia Flash ActiveX and AJAX. Such additional types of content may be used in various ways including to provide interactive maps weather reports traffic conditions calendars reservation services e.g. for restaurants entertainment travel etc. community based content e.g. wikis online communities etc. ranking and other reputation related services etc. Such additional types of content may also be generated by a response provider user for a particular response in various ways including in some embodiments by using a set of standardized tools modules and or development environments that are provided by the Rapid Answer system. For example in some embodiments the Rapid Answer system may provide multiple content specific modules that may each be selected and configured by a response provider user to provide a particular piece of content of a particular type as part of a response such as a map module a calendar module a restaurant reservation module etc. Other embodiments may provide a toolkit and or API that allows response provider users and or third party developers to implement and provide custom content modules for use by response provider users and inclusion as part of responses. In some embodiments facilities for the generation and transfer of licensing fees for custom content modules may also be provided such as for a third party developer that provides a custom content module to receive fees from response provider users who use the module e.g. fees that may be automatically deducted from any fees awarded to such response provider users from use of the module .

The incorporation of various forms of content by response provider users in responses may also give rise to various legal issues including copyright and trademark such as based on how and when the content was generated. For example if a response provider user includes content of one or more defined types e.g. images audio or video clips etc. as part of a response the Rapid Answer system may in some embodiments attempt to gain assurance that the response provider user has rights to provide the content. Such assurance may be provided by for example an affirmative indication by the response provider user that he she has the authority to provide the content by specifying terms and conditions for use of the Rapid Answer system that only authorized content may be provided by warranties or other guarantees provided by the response provider user etc. Other embodiments may provide mechanisms by which potential rights holders can provide notice to response provider users and or the operators of the Rapid Answer system of potential rights violations such as to allow unauthorized content to promptly be removed or otherwise handled.

In some embodiments similar types of information may be displayed for other types of users such as requester users and or item provider users. For example requester users may be provided with information to enable retrieval of questions that the requester user has previously asked or viewed to view points and or money spent asking questions etc. and item provider users may be able to see the amount of money spent to provide their responses and or answers that include their responses. In addition if an individual user plays different roles in the system the user may be able to view all their account information at once or to instead switch between roles as indicated.

The question matching criteria section in this example includes multiple groups of question matching criteria that each identify a distinct set of questions of interest with each criteria group including a category field a keywords field and a bid field . In this example the criteria will be used to determine to notify the item provider user of a given question supplied by a requester user if the question matches one of the criteria groups and if the bid is sufficiently high e.g. is the highest bid of any matching group of criteria of any item provider user is within the top X highest such bids where X is a predetermined number although in other embodiments other factors may additionally be used e.g. whether an item provider user has a preferred or premium status such as based on past interactions with the Rapid Answer system and or based on payment for such status whether the item provider user frequently elects to exercise options of which the user is notified etc. . In the illustrated embodiment a given group of criteria matches a question when the category displayed in the category field is identical to the category of the supplied question and all of the keywords displayed in the keywords field appear somewhere in the question text metadata associated with the question and or metadata associated with the requester user who supplied the question e.g. geographic location demographic information etc. . For example in criteria the item provider user has expressed interest in questions of any category as illustrated by the use of that match the keywords Seattle and plumber . In criteria the item provider user has expressed interest in questions in the Plumbing category that also match the keyword Seattle. In criteria the item provider user has expressed interest in questions in any category that match the keywords plumbing and leak . In criteria the item provider user has expressed interest in questions in the Plumbing category. In criteria the item provider user has expressed interest in questions in any category that match the keyword pipes .

Various approaches for matching questions with question matching criteria are contemplated. For example in various embodiments the supplied category and or keywords may be matched individually and combined in various manners to determine a potential match. Some embodiments may provide a hierarchy of categories e.g. super categories containing one or more sub categories and determine a category match only when either a category specified by an item provider user is identical to the question category or when the specified category is a super category of the question category. Such embodiments may elect not to determine a category match when the specified category is a sub category of the question category because by specifying a more specialized category the item provider user may indicate that they are not interested in questions containing generalized subject matter. In addition various embodiments may employ various techniques when comparing keywords specified by item provider users to the supplied question such as word stemming approximate matching regular expression matching etc. Furthermore various approaches to combining multiple keywords keyword matches and or category matches are contemplated such as by way of various logical operators such as and or etc. In addition the various techniques described above may be configurable and or selectable by the item provider user such as by providing the item provider user with the ability to specify keywords using regular expression syntax and or allowing the user to select from various logical operators that should be used to combine various category and keyword matches.

Each of the illustrated criteria also includes a bid field . In the illustrated embodiment the item provider user may utilize the bid field in order to express an amount of money that he she is willing to pay if he she elects to provide a response to a question that matches the associated criteria. For example if a question matches criteria category Plumbing and keywords Seattle the item provider user has expressed that they are willing to pay 0.70 if they choose to provide a response to that question. If on the other hand a question matches criteria any category and keywords pipes the item provider user has expressed that they are willing to pay only 0.10 if they choose to provide a response to that question. The differences in values expressed in the various criteria may reflect the fact that a given item provider user more strongly values more specific matches than more general matches. For example questions that match criteria may include plumbing related questions as well as car related e.g. exhaust pipes and tobacco related e.g. tobacco pipes questions and therefore not be as worthwhile for an item provider user in the plumbing business.

The amount of money that a given item provider user indicates that they are willing to pay to provide a response may be utilized in various ways. For example some embodiments may preferentially notify item provider users who have bid greater amounts of money for given criteria. For example supposing that multiple item provider users have each bid on criteria that match a given question some embodiments may elect to only notify some subset of those item provider users based at least in part on the amount of money that each item provider user has respectively bid. The subset of item provider users may be selected in various manners including but not limited to selecting the highest bidder selecting some number of high bidders where the number is a predetermined number or percentage of the total number of matching bidders randomly selecting some number of bidders e.g. with the probability of selecting a given item provider user being weighted by the amount of their bid such that higher bidders are more likely to be selected etc. In addition the amount of money that item provider users are actually charged for providing responses may be based in part on the amount of money they bid for matching criteria. For example in some embodiments item provider users who provide information for answers will be charged the amount that they bid for the criteria that matched the question while in other embodiments such item provider users may be charged other amounts of money e.g. the lowest amount or the average amount bid by all of the item provider users who match are notified or elect to submit information for inclusion in the answer .

The question matching notification mechanism in this example includes multiple selectable notification mechanisms including via email IM and phone e.g. automatically such as by an IVR or Interactive Voice Response system . By specifying and selecting at least one of the notification mechanisms the item provider user may control how he she receives notification of a question that has matched at least one of the question matching criteria . Additional notification mechanisms are contemplated including via text messages e.g. Short Message Service messages sent to mobile telephones paging news feeds etc.

The response section in this example includes a prompt a user selectable answer field and a submit button . In this example the user is provided with only a limited ability to provide paid response information to be included in the answer for the question and in particular to respond by providing previously specified profile information for the item provider user. Such profile information may be default contact and or other information as provided by the item provider user such as to enable the requester user to contact the item provider user. The response section in this example additionally informs the item provider user that they will be charged 0.75 if they choose to submit a response such as based on one or more bids as described with reference to . The item provider user may opt to have their response submitted by selecting the appropriate answer Yes in answer field and by activating the submit button . If the item provider user instead selects the No option in the answer field and activates the submit button or if the item provider user takes no action e.g. by not activating the submit button in the specified time period the item provider user will not be charged and their response information will not be included in the answer for the question in at least some embodiments. As previously noted in at least some embodiments a paid response or other information provided by such an item provider user for paid inclusion in the answer for a question may be accompanied by multiple other paid responses from other item provider users and or may be accompanied by multiple non paid responses from one or more response provider users.

Other embodiments may utilize alternative mechanisms for enabling the provision of paid answers to questions submitted by requester users. For example some embodiments may enable item provider users to store various pre configured responses and then select from those responses at the time when the item provider user responds to the notification. Such pre configured responses may include text audio images multimedia active content and other forms of content that specify addresses advertisements URLs price quotes etc. Various embodiments may further elect to handle responses provided after an indicated time period for submitting responses in various ways such as to simply discard such responses and not charge the item provider user or to provide such responses as part of an answer that may be viewed by later viewers. Such embodiments may perform such elections interactively such as by informing the item provider user that they have submitted a response after the indicated time period for responses but that they may elect to have their response included for later viewers for a price e.g. a price that reflects a discount of the price that would be ordinarily have been charged to that item provider user to submit a response .

In a manner similar to illustrates an example GUI screen or page that may display a portion of the answer to a question such as to the requester user who submitted the question but in this example the displayed information includes a paid response provided by an item provider user. In particular in this example the displayed information includes a question section a summary section and responses . The question section provides details related to the question submitted by a requester user with the example question in this case requesting information related to purchasing digital cameras. The summary section indicates that three agents have provided a total of 10 responses so far and that a single camera merchant has provided a paid response. The example responses include a paid response from an item provider user and a portion of a response provider user response . The example paid response illustrates an example of information about a particular camera merchant including current availability e.g. 11 Popular Brand Model XYZ Digital cameras in stock and price e.g. that they are available for 199.95 each as of a given date . The answer is otherwise similar to that described in more detail with reference to .

Other embodiments may display multiple responses from item provider users to a supplied question in various ways. For example some embodiments will order such responses based on the amount that each item provider user bid for the criteria used to initially match the question such that responses provided by item provider users who bid higher amounts of money will be listed prior to or more prominently than e.g. using different font sizes and or colors responses provided by item provider users who bid lower amounts of money. In some embodiments only the response provided by the highest paying item provider user may be displayed by default and other responses may optionally be displayed only if the requester user or other user viewing the answer indicates that they wish to view such other responses e.g. by clicking a link or activating some other user selectable control that enables the user to access or otherwise view such other responses .

In addition in some embodiments a variety of additional types of functionality may be provided by the Rapid Answer system via one or more such GUI screens or pages. For example in addition to providing feedback on particular responses that are supplied as part of the answer for a submitted question the requester user who supplied the question may further provide various types of feedback related to the response provider users who submitted the responses e.g. to indicate a response provider user who is particularly helpful and or unhelpful such as based on the provided responses and or on clarifications or other interactions with the response provider user and or related to one or more item provider users who submitted paid responses or to those paid responses e.g. to indicate unhelpful or abusive paid responses such as for use by the Rapid Answer system in restricting or preventing future such paid responses from the item provider user . Similarly response provider users may also provide various types of feedback regarding a question for which the response provider user is participating in providing one or more responses such as to indicate particular responses that are supplied by other response provider users for the submitted question as being helpful e.g. the best answer and or unhelpful e.g. lame or abusive and to provide feedback regarding tags or other category information submitted by other response provider users and or the requester user e.g. to indicate the best tag or category or to indicate unhelpful or abusive tags or categories . In addition in some embodiments users other than a requester user who submitted a question and the response provider users who provide responses for the question may be able to provide similar types of feedback for the question such as for viewer users and or item provider users to supply tags and other categories and or to provide feedback regarding others tags categories responses and participation. Moreover in some embodiments users may be able to specify various security and or privacy preferences and other information such as to prevent a requester user s location information from being displayed unless it is relevant to the question or to prevent usernames or other identity information of users to be provided to others.

In addition while examples of various interactions by various users with the Rapid Answer system have been illustrated using a GUI provided by the Rapid Answer system these and other related types of interactions may be performed in various other manners in other embodiments. For example submission of questions submission of responses and other types of interactions may be programmatically provided to the Rapid Answer system via one or more APIs provided by the Rapid Answer system in some embodiments such as via one or more Web services provided by the Rapid Answer system. Alternatively in some embodiments some or all such types of interactions by various users with the Rapid Answer system may instead be performed using a messaging interface based on email or other types of electronic messages or in other manners e.g. based on an automated voice based message system such as via phone messages . Moreover in some embodiments multiple modes of interaction may be used by a particular user with respect to a particular question such as to submit a question via email and to receive responses for the answer using one or more other modes of communication e.g. via an automated phone call via an IM or SMS message by interacting with the Rapid Answer system via a GUI or in a programmatic manner etc. . In embodiments that utilize IM to receive questions and responses and to provide answers the Rapid Answer system may have an IM identity indicated by a handle or username e.g. RapidAnswers that users may add to a contact list e.g. a buddy list for purposes of sending and receiving instant messages to and from the Rapid Answer system that contain questions responses and or answers.

In particular illustrates an example email message that an example requester user UserABC has sent to submit a question to the Rapid Answer system such as to an email address provided by the Rapid Answer system for receiving such questions in this example ask rapid answer.com . In this example the question is specified as part of the subject line of the email such as to request information about Italian restaurants in Boston and other information related to the question is not specified e.g. tags or other categories other metadata related to the question etc. . illustrates an alternative example email message that requester user UserABC has sent to submit a question to the Rapid Answer system but in this example the email message body includes information to specify additional related information such as tags or other category information a geographic location associated with the question and information about a reward offered by UserABC for providing an answer for the question. In other embodiments such question specific rewards designated by requester users may not be used such as if each requester user is instead charged the same amount to submit a question e.g. ten cents and or if the same number of experience points is provided as a reward for each such submitted question. Additional information such as tag and or category information reward information etc. is identified in the illustrated email by preceding the information with a textual indicator to identify the type of the subsequent information e.g. by using tags to indicate the specified tags but can be specified in other manners in other embodiments. For example illustrates an example in line in which a character based indicator is instead used to identify tag information that is being supplied in this example an at sign . In other embodiments various types of information about a question being submitted may instead be submitted in other manners such as by including the question text in the body of the email submitting the question via multiple related emails etc.

In addition in this example the Rapid Answer system further automatically includes additional information in the response emails sent to UserABC which in this example are tracking identifiers shown in lines and of the response emails that are unique to the submitted question. In this example the tracking identifiers are related but each distinct e.g. by including a common base identifier 2341973293 followed by a suffix identifier specific to each response email but in other embodiments may instead be related in other manners identical for all of the response emails for a particular question or unrelated to each other e.g. by each being randomly generated and associated with the corresponding response email . The tracking identifiers are provided in this example to provide additional security with respect to some types of actions taken by requester users. For example while UserABC was able in this example to supply a question without including a tracking identifier or other information for use in verifying the authenticity of the email with which the question is submitted e.g. a password or other identifying information for UserABC at least some other types of interactions in this example by UserABC may require additional verification such as by including a tracking identifier from an email supplied for the question to which the interaction is related e.g. to provide feedback regarding the responses and or response provider users or from any email e.g. to provide a command to the Rapid Answer system related to the account of UserABC that is not specific to the submitted question . By including a tracking identifier from a prior email sent to the requester user from the Rapid Answer system additional security is provided in that a malicious user without access to such prior emails cannot send effective emails to the Rapid Answer system on behalf of UserABC.

Example feedback email provides an alternative example of a feedback email from requester user UserABC related to prior response email and in particular illustrates an example of a feedback email that is generated by UserABC without use of any special feedback related controls provided to UserABC. Instead in this example UserABC provides feedback related to the response email by using email reply capabilities with the response email included in the reply feedback email in typical fashion including the tracking identifier that was present in response email with the reply email being returned to the sender of the response email which in this example was indicated to be the same ask rapid answer.com email address although in other embodiments a distinct response email address could be used for each of some or all of the response emails such as response rapid answer.com and with the Unhelpful feedback being manually input by UserABC in line of the body of the feedback email. In other embodiments tracking identifiers and or other tracking functionality may be used in other manners and while the tracking identifiers are labeled in this example in other embodiments the tracking identifiers may not be labeled and or may be otherwise obfuscated in order to prevent identification of the information by malicious users. Such obfuscation may be accomplished in various ways such as by being placed into email message headers that are typically not displayed by email clients by being located in non displayable portions of a rich text message body e.g. as a comment in an HTML formatted message body by being embedded or otherwise encoded in binary message content e.g. as a comment field or watermark in binary image data etc.

Thus the Rapid Answer system may perform various types of interactions with various types of users. Additional details related to one example system for interacting with users to supply tasks to be done and to receive corresponding results are included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 990 949 filed Nov. 16 2004 and entitled Providing An Electronic Marketplace To Facilitate Human Performance Of Programmatically Submitted Tasks which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

As previously noted a response provider user may receive payment or other compensation from the Rapid Answer system at various times such as for a response for a particular question that has a monetary reward and or as part of sharing a portion of an ongoing revenue stream associated with one or more answers to which the response provider user contributed. In some embodiments such monetary rewards are associated with an account of the response provider user at the Rapid Answer system and the response provider user may access the account e.g. at designated times or in designated situations such as once the accumulated earnings have reached a minimum threshold or no more often than a designated access frequency or instead at any time in order to obtain access their accumulated earnings e.g. to be used as part of an ecommerce transaction to be obtained as cash etc. . In other embodiments earnings may be automatically provided to response provider users in other manners e.g. periodically such as monthly such as by a payment component that is part of the Rapid Answer system or instead based on interactions between the Rapid Answer system and one or more third party payment systems. In addition other types of users may similarly receive and or make payments in some embodiments and situations such as by interacting with such a payment component of the Rapid Answer system or instead based on interactions with one or more third party payment systems. Additional details related to example systems for making payments and for tracking related information for users are included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 894 350 filed Jul. 19 2004 and entitled Performing Automatically Authorized Programmatic Transactions and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 200 880 filed Aug. 9 2005 and entitled Performing Providing Payments Automatically In Accordance With Predefined Instructions each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments rewards may be allocated to response provider users who provide responses to questions of other requester users and illustrate examples of allocations of such rewards. In particular shows an example of a reward allocation for responses to a question to which 100 experience points have been allocated for the question s answer. In the table there are columns for responses response provider user response provider user response provider user response provider user response provider user and total points . Rows each represent an individual unique response. Although the number of responses equals the number of response provider users in this example the numbers are exemplary and in other situations there may be differing numbers of responses and response provider users.

Since there were 5 unique responses and 100 points for the question in this example each unique response is allocated an equal number of 20 points. Once the points for each response are determined the points may be allocated to response provider users by dividing the number of points by the number of response provider users that gave the response. Thus for Link A since the points for Link A is 20 points and 4 response provider users gave the response each response provider user gets 5 points 20 points 4 response provider users . The process is repeated for all remaining responses and the results are shown in rows . In addition some types of responses may be considered to be inherently unique such as if all opinions are considered unique. Thus if multiple response provider users provide an opinion each opinion may count as a separate response. In addition some types of responses e.g. phone numbers may be unique if the system will not accept an additional response that is a duplicate. Totals for the response provider users may be calculated by adding the number of points within each response provider user s column i.e. for all the responses supplied by the response provider user . Thus response provider user receives a total of 15 experience points 5 for Link A and 10 for Link B for his her responses to this question. These assessed experience points that are newly allocated to a response provider user may then be combined with any prior experience points or other related information for a user in order to determine a current assessed experience score such as by adding the newly allocated experience points or otherwise combining the new and existing experience points e.g. in a weighted manner such as to give greater weight to recent experience points or to historical experience points .

In other embodiments other algorithms may be employed to allocate experience points to responses and or to response provider users. In some embodiments various factors other than uniqueness of responses may be used to allocate points to responses including the quality of responses e.g. as measured by feedback from a requester user who supplied the corresponding question and or by feedback from other response provider users who provided responses for the question and or timeliness of the received responses e.g. to provide more points for rapidly provided responses and or for responses provided by an indicated deadline . In addition rather than allocating a fixed number of experience points for an answer in some embodiments each response and or response provider user may be allocated a variable number of experience points based on a metric such as quality and or timeliness each of which may be measured in various ways in various embodiments. For example quality may be measured based on feedback received from one or more users and or in an automatically assessed manner such as based on a comparison to other responses such as responses known or believed to be of particular levels of quality and or other factors such as a completeness or other objectively measurable aspect of the response and timeliness may similarly be measured based on feedback received from one or more users and or in an automatically assessed manner. As one example each response may be allocated 20 experience points if given the highest rating 10 experience points if given a good rating 5 experience points if given an acceptable rating or if not explicitly rated 10 experience points if given a lame or otherwise unhelpful rating and 20 experience points if given an abusive rating. As another example a response provider user who first provided a response may be favored and given more points e.g. of the points for the response such as for embodiments that allow response provider users to see responses from other response provider users. In some embodiments if a question is associated with multiple categories then the experience points given may be divided by the number of categories to award experience points for each category. Thus for a two category question the response provider user would receive 7.5 points for each category. In other embodiments the experience points for each response are not divided for each category and the same number of experience points for the response are awarded for each category. In some embodiments points are rounded to the nearest whole point while in others fractional experience points may be awarded.

In other embodiments penalties and award allocation may be performed in different manners and the illustrated examples are merely exemplary. Thus in some embodiments if a response is marked as abusive only the abusive answer may be removed and result in a penalty and the response provider user s other responses may still result in experience points. In some embodiments the requester user may identify multiple responses as lame and or abusive. In some embodiments the predetermined number of experience points taken away as a penalty may escalate based on the number of lame or abusive responses received from a user within a period of time such as a rolling time period or a fixed time period. In some embodiments various information may further be displayed such as the percentage of responses marked as lame and or abusive. In some embodiments response provider users may also identify responses of other response provider users as lame or abusive and in some embodiments item provider users responses may also be marked as lame and or abusive. Furthermore in some embodiments response provider users may be penalized in manners other than a reduction in experience points such as by temporarily or permanently banning such users from receiving questions providing answers or undertaking other actions.

In addition in some embodiments experience points may be utilized to incentivize or otherwise control the activity of item provider users. For example item provider users may be awarded experience points based on positive feedback obtained from requester users and or other users of the Rapid Answer system. Such feedback may be based on the usefulness of responses e.g. accuracy and or responsiveness of information provided and or evaluations of goods and or services provided by an item provider user e.g. quality of provided service promptness of delivery of provided goods value of provided goods etc. . In addition item provider users may be incentivized to obtain successively higher levels of expertise e.g. as measured by an accumulation of experience points by providing additional benefits to item provider users with advanced expertise levels. Such benefits may include favorable payment terms e.g. discounts on the amount of money an item provider pays to provide a response longer periods of time for account payment etc. increased access to questions that are more likely to be valuable to item provider users e.g. requests for information for expensive goods and or services etc. In addition penalties may be utilized to provide disincentives for item provider users to undertake undesirable activities. Such undesirable activities may include for example submitting responses that are not unhelpful or otherwise irrelevant e.g. advertisements or solicitations for goods and or services not related to those indicated by the question providing nonconforming goods and or services e.g. defective goods poor quality service slow delivery failure to honor warranties etc. etc. Such penalties may be based on a reduction of accumulated experience points for an item provider user such that a penalized item provider user may lose an enhanced status that was based on accumulation of experience points. In addition other penalty mechanisms may be used such as temporary or permanent prohibitions of particular actions of a penalized item provider user e.g. bans on providing any responses or providing responses to certain categories of questions etc .

In other embodiments different allocation algorithms may be utilized. For example response provider users who provided a response marked lame or abusive may not receive a revenue share for the answer in some embodiments. In some embodiments response provider users who only provided a lame response may instead have their revenue share percentage adjusted downward while the response provider user who provided the best response may receive the portion of the revenue taken away from the response provider user that provided the lame response. If multiple categories were associated with the answer the revenue stream determination may first determine the amount of revenue for each category e.g. by dividing the total revenue stream portion by the number of categories and then perform a relative ranking based on each category.

Preferred or other enhanced status may also change over time resulting in the gain or loss of the additional time for revenue sharing. In some embodiments once the revenue share is lost it may be lost forever and subsequently obtaining an enhanced status may not restore it. In other embodiments if a response provider user achieves an enhanced status he she is eligible for revenue sharing during an extended period even for responses previously provided when the response provider user did not have the enhanced status and even for answers that entered the extended period when the response provider user did not have the enhanced status. However after some period of time even users with enhanced status may not receive ongoing payments.

In the illustrated embodiment a Rapid Answer system and a revenue generation system are executing in the memory of the rapid answer computing system . The Rapid Answer system interacts with other computing systems via the network e.g. via the Internet and or the World Wide Web in order to perform at least some of the described techniques. The Rapid Answer system includes a Requester User Interaction Manager component a Response Provider User Interaction Manager component an Item Provider User Interaction Manager component an Answer Reward Allocation Manager component an Answer Revenue Stream Share Determination Manager component an Answer Categorization Manager component an Answer Experience Level Incentive Manager component a payment component and optional other components . In other embodiments the components may instead be organized in other manners. The Answer Reward Allocation Manager component the Answer Revenue Stream Share Determination Manager component the Answer Categorization Manager component the Answer Experience Level Incentive Manager component may be used internally and various security measures may prevent external access to these components. In addition in the illustrated embodiment a variety of data structures e.g. databases are present in the storage for use by the Rapid Answer system and the revenue generation system although in other embodiments some or all such databases may instead be located elsewhere and or organized in other manners.

The revenue generation system interacts with multiple advertisers computer systems to generate revenue and store details about the revenue generated. Revenue details may be stored in the revenue database data structure. In those embodiments that determine or estimate the revenue generated for each question the revenue generation system may also keep track of the revenue generated for the question or the factors used in estimating the revenue respectively. The revenue generation system may also interact with the item provider computer systems. In some embodiments the revenue generation system may also cache or stores advertisements to place onto graphical user interfaces for the viewer user and potentially other types of users.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the illustrated computing systems are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The rapid answer computing system may be connected to other devices that are not illustrated including through one or more networks such as the Internet the Web or LAN Local Area Network . More generally the rapid answer computing system requester user computing systems response provider user computing systems and other computing systems may comprise any combination of hardware and software that can interact in the manners described including computers network devices internet appliances PDAs Personal Digital Assistants wireless phones pagers electronic organizers television based systems and other various consumer products that include inter communication capabilities. In addition the functionality provided by the Rapid Answer system components illustrated in may in some embodiments be combined in fewer components or distributed in additional components. Similarly in some embodiments the functionalities of some of the illustrated components may not be provided and or other additional functionality may be available.

Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that while various items are illustrated as being stored in memory or on storage while being used these items or portions of them can be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity. Alternatively in other embodiments some or all of the software modules and or components may execute in memory on another device and communicate with the illustrated computing device via inter computer communication. Some or all of the rapid answer system components or data structures may also be stored e.g. as instructions or structured data on a computer readable medium such as a hard disk a memory a network or a portable article to be read by an appropriate drive. The access manager components and data structures can also be transmitted as generated data signals e.g. as part of a carrier wave on a variety of computer readable transmission mediums including wireless based and wired cable based mediums. Accordingly the present invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations.

At step the routine receives a question one or more tags and optionally a reward and additional information as appropriate from a requester user. Additional information may include information that requester users regularly fail to provide such as the requester user s location or operating system for a computer question. The additional information may also include a time in which the question should be answered and a summary of the question. After step during step a reward is determined for each question. If the user did not specify the reward for the question in points e.g. instead specified in units of currency then the Rapid Answer system may convert the reward into a corresponding number of points for later use by the Answer Reward Allocation Manager routine . Points may be obtained by requester users in various ways including by purchasing them from the Rapid Answer system and or by grant from the Rapid Answer system e.g. if every requester user receives an initial allotment of points and or receives additional points on a periodic basis and in some embodiments a simple exchange rate may be utilized between government currency and points e.g. 100 points 1.00 .

At step the requester user s account is updated to reflect the reward. For example if the reward was money the requester user may be charged the amount during step and if the reward was a number of points then the points to be used to make request may be deducted. The routine may then wait for the responses to the question at step . In some embodiments since there are a lot of response provider users responses may be provided within minutes. However if the question is about local services and it is the middle of the night locally the response may take longer. In some embodiments while waiting for a response the requester user may be asked for clarification of a question. For example if the requester user fails to provide the requester user s location then a clarification may involve asking the requester user for the requester user s location. After waiting for the response in at step the responses are provided to the requester user. In some embodiments such responses may be provided to the requester user via one or more electronic messages e.g. with each response sent in a separate email message and the Rapid Answer system may further include a tracking identifier in some or all some electronic messages e.g. a unique tracking identifier for each electronic message such as may be randomly generated and associated with the requester user . After providing the responses the requester user may provide feedback that is received by the routine at step . The feedback may take the form of indicating that one or more of the responses is lame abusive or excellent. In some embodiments the feedback may be provided to the Answer Reward Allocation Manager routine so that the point allocation can be adjusted appropriately. In step other operations may be optionally performed. For example if the question was not answered or all responses were unhelpful or abusive the update to requester user s account regarding the reward may be rolled back. At step the routine determines whether or not to continue. If so then the routine continues to step . If not the routine ends at step .

In step the routine provides indications of the identified questions to the response provider user and receives a response to the indicated question and optionally one or more categories. In some embodiments the response from the response provider user may include multiple items e.g. multiple URLs that are the source of the information a URL and a phone number . After receiving the response the response is stored in step such as storing the response in the answer database data structure. In step the routine determines if the question is complete. A question may be complete when the time period for the response has expired after a predetermined number of responses have been received after a predetermined number of response provider users have given responses to the question or after the requester user who submitted the question has indicated that the question is complete. If the question is complete then the routine at step indicates that the question is complete and proceeds to step . The indication that the question is complete may also be provided to other components such as the Answer Reward Allocation Manager of for purposes of determining reward allocation for the completed question. If the question is determined to not be complete the routine proceeds to step .

During step the routine optionally performs additional processing. In some embodiments the optional additional processing may include adding additional area of expertise to the response provider user s expertise. Additionally the routine may in some embodiments at step receive feedback from the response provider users such as voting on the best response best category and suggesting tags. The routine may also perform the additional processing of determining if any additional rewards such as the ones specified by the requester user are to be awarded and if so providing the appropriate indications. After the optional additional processing at step the routine determines whether or not to continue. If so then the routine continues to step . If not the routine ends at step .

The Item Provider User Interaction Management routine begins in step and receives an item provider user request or a notification to present a question to an item provider user for an optional response. In some embodiments an item provider user request may be received for example from a user interface component that displays a GUI screen such as the one described with reference to . In some embodiments a notification to present a question to an item provider user may be received from for example the Requester User Interaction component of upon the receipt of a question provided by a requester user. In step the routine determines whether an item provider user request or a notification was received. If it is determined that an item provider user request was received the routine proceeds to step . Item provider user requests may be received by way of a user interface such as the one described with reference to . In step the routine determines whether the item provider user request is to specify question matching criteria. If so the routine proceeds to step and obtains and stores question matching criteria such as those described with reference to for the item provider that made the request. If it is instead determined in step that the item provider user request does not specify question matching criteria or after step the routine proceeds to step and determines whether the item provider user request is to specify contact information for the item provider user. If so the routine proceeds to step and obtains and stores contact information for the item provider user. If it is instead determined in step that the item provider user request is not to specify contact information or after step the routine proceeds to step and determines whether some other action is indicated by the item provider user request. If so the routine proceeds to step and performs the other indicated action as appropriate. Other actions may include item provider user account operations such as setting up or modifying payment mechanisms modifying one or more pre configured responses etc.

If it is instead determined in step that a notification has been received the routine proceeds to step and presents the question and an option to respond to the indicated item provider user of step . In step the routine waits to receive a timeout or to receive an indication from the item provider user. As described in more detail elsewhere the item provider user may have a pre determined period of time in which to accept or reject the option to provide a response to the question. During the pre determined time period the item provider user may explicitly indicate that they have either accepted or rejected e.g. by activating the appropriate user interface controls such as those described with reference to . Alternatively if the item provider user does not respond within the pre determined time period of if they respond after the pre determined time period it will typically be treated as a rejection of the option. In step the routine determines whether a timeout or an indication of option rejection has been received. If neither a timeout nor an option rejection has been received the routine proceeds to step and provides a response from the item provider user for the question answer. The response provided by the item provider user may be incorporated with or otherwise displayed as part of the answer provided to the requester user as shown for example in . In step the routine obtains payment from the item provider user. Payment may be obtained by various techniques including electronic funds transfers between bank accounts e.g. debits from an item provider account credit card payment processing etc. In some embodiments the actual payment for an individual response may be aggregated in an account which may be billed to the item provider user on a periodic e.g. monthly or other e.g. when the account value reaches or exceeds a pre determined threshold amount . Other embodiments may elect to delay obtaining payment until a condition is met such as when the requester user is actually provided the response e.g. by serving a Web page that displays the answer containing the response or when the requester user actually selects e.g. clicks a URL provided by the item provider user or otherwise indicates that they are viewing or otherwise showing interest in the provided response and or answer that includes response.

If it is instead determined in step that the request does not indicate some other action or if it is instead determined in step that a timeout or an option rejection has been received or after steps and the routine proceeds to step and determines whether to continue. If so the routine proceeds to step and continues processing. If not the routine proceeds to step and ends.

After determining the total number of experience points for the question the routine identifies unique responses and the number of response provider users that provided a response used in the answer in step . After identifying unique responses and the number of response provider users the routine proceeds to step and determines the one or more categories associated with the answer. The determination of categories is described in more detail with reference to the Answer Categorization Manager Routine of . After determining the categories the number of points for each category is determined in step . In some embodiments the number of points per category may be determined by dividing the total number of points by the number of categories such as described in more reference to .

During step the routine allocates for each category the points for the category between the response provider users to reflect their contribution to the unique responses. The routine continues to step . In step the routine optionally performs additional processing such as in some embodiments updating the area of expertise of the response provider user. In some embodiments the additional processing may also provide indications of bonuses awarded to the response provider user e.g. to the response provider user account DB for use by other components such as the Answer Experience Level Incentive Manager or the payment component of . After optionally performing the additional processing at step the routine determines whether or not to continue. If so then the routine continues to step . If not the routine ends at step .

If in step the routine determines that the request was for feedback from a requester user then the routine proceeds to step where the routine determines if one or more responses were marked unhelpful. If so then the routine proceeds to step where the unhelpful response s are removed from the reward allocation and the points reallocated appropriately. An illustration of an embodiment of how to reallocate points for an unhelpful response is demonstrated in . After adjusting the point allocation appropriately or if no responses were marked unhelpful the routine continues to step where the routine determines if any of the responses were marked as abusive. If so in step the appropriate penalty for the response s marked as abusive is awarded and points are reallocated. The appropriate penalty may involve removing the responses marked as abusive and not awarding any points for other responses from response provider users that provided the abusive response. An illustration of an example embodiment of how to reallocate points for an abusive response is demonstrated in . After removing the abusive response and reallocating points or if there were no responses marked as abusive the routine continues to step . In step the routine determines if other feedback has been received. Additional feedback may include best response best response provider user and other positive feedback. If a response is elected to be the best answer a number of bonus points may be awarded in some embodiments to the response provider user that provided the response. For example best answer information may be leveraged to determine the order to display previously answered questions to viewer users within a category.

At step the next answer is selected. If this is the first question then the first question may be selected. After selecting the answer the routine identifies the response provider users that gave responses for the answer and are eligible to receive the revenue share at step . Response provider users may not be eligible after the period of time for sharing revenue for non preferred users has passed unless enhanced status has been granted for at least one of the categories associated with the answer. Thus the routine may need to check on the enhanced status of the response provider users. After determining the response provider users that provided a response for the answer in step in step the categories for the question are identified. In some embodiments categories may have been automatically determined by a routine such as the Answer Categorization Manager routine described with reference to . The next category is selected in step and in step the portion of the revenue stream for the category may be determined. In some embodiments the amount for each is category is determined by dividing the revenue determined for the answer by the number of categories associated with the answer while in other embodiments the revenue may be adjusted by the relative popularity of the categories. After determining the amount of money for the selected category the routine determines the relative experience ranking of the response provider users with respect to the selected category in step . In step the routine allocates the category s determined monetary amount between the response provider users based on the relative ranking. During step the routine may determine if a response provider user is eligible to receive a revenue share for this category at all. Response provider users that do not have enhanced status for this category may not be eligible after a predetermined period of time when normal users may no longer receive the ongoing revenue share. In step the routine determines if there are any more categories. If so the routine returns to step to select the next category. If not the routine proceeds to step .

During step the routine provides indications of the allocated monetary amounts. In some embodiments the routine will pass the indicated monetary amounts to the payment component of however in other embodiments the amounts may be stored in the response provider user account DB of until the payments reach a predetermined amount of money. At step the routine determines whether or not there are more revenue eligible answers. If so then the routine continues to step . If not the routine ends at step .

In some embodiments at least part of the revenue stream is shared with the response provider users who provided responses used in the answer to a particular question on an ongoing basis. However the ongoing revenue stream sharing may end after a period of time such as 12 months. In some embodiments a user may extend that period of time by attaining enhanced incentive level status. Enhanced status may be determined in a number of ways such as based on the total number of experience points accumulated by a given response provider user within a category or the relative ranking of a response provider user e.g. top 10 in a particular category or instead in a manner that is not specific to a category. Enhanced status may confer a number of benefits including receiving notifications of new questions associated with one or more categories and automatically accepting a question to be answered by a response provider user e.g. if the question matches indicated criteria . In some embodiments enhanced status may also allow preferred response provider users having enhanced status to continue to receive ongoing payments for the responses for a longer period of time than non preferred response provider users. Thus response provider users are advantageously incentivized to continue to provide answers in order to continue to receive the revenue stream share for the response provider users historical responses. In some embodiments there may further be multiple levels of enhanced status. In some embodiments if a response provider user was voted to have the best response for an answer or to be the best response provider user for that question the response provider user may be granted quasi enhanced status in which the user gains the benefit of having enhanced status for that answer only thereby allowing the quasi enhanced response provider user to continue to receive a revenue share for that answer for an extended period of time. As a result a casual response provider user may be incentivized to provide high quality responses. Additional details regarding the determination of incentive level status for response provider users are provided with reference to .

If it is instead determined in step that the indication was not to categorize based on tags supplied by the requester user the routine proceeds to step and determines if the indications to categorize were based on responses. If so the routine determines one or more categories based on the responses at step . The routine may categorize based on the responses in some embodiments by checking to see if the response has previously been given and if so of which category associated with the answer the response is a part. In some embodiments this may be performed only on certain types of responses such as links or phone numbers instead of opinions. In some embodiments categories may only become associated with the answer if two or more responses were associated with the same category. After determining one or more categories based on the responses the routine proceeds to step .

If the request was not to categorize based on the responses the routine proceeds to step where the routine determines if the request was to use tags from the response provider user to categorize the answer. If so the routine proceeds to to determine one or more categories based on the tags supplied by the response provider users. The routine may perform this in a similar manner to categorizing on tags supplied by the requester user. After determining one or more categories based on tags supplied by response provider users or if the request was not to use tags from response provider users the routine proceeds to step .

In step the routine may use other category feedback to adjust the categories associated with the answer. For example response provider users may vote on the best category in some embodiments. If a response previously used to determine a category was removed since it was unhelpful or abusive the routine may decide if one or more categories should be unassociated with the answer as a result. Conversely if a response was marked as the best response then all of the categories associated with the best response from previous answers may become associated with the answer. After using the other feedback to adjust categories at step the routine optionally performs additional processing. The additional processing may include sending indications to the Answer Reward Allocation Manager routine e.g. to start the reward allocation now that categories are determined or updating the index used for browsing the answers. After performing the additional processing in step the routine determines whether to continue. If so the routine returns to step . If not the routine ends at step .

After determining the current status the routine determines if the current incentive level status is a change from the previous incentive level status at step . If so the routine continues to step to provide indications of the incentive level status change for the category e.g. providing indications to the Answer Revenue Stream Share Determination Manager component of turning on and off enhanced status functionality . If the current incentive level status has not changed or after providing the appropriate notifications at step the routine optionally performs additional processing. The additional processing may include checking if any bonuses have been earned. After performing the optional processing the routine determines if there are additional response provider users with expertise in the category at step . If so the routine returns to step . If not the routine optionally performs additional processing at step . Optional processing may include indications to store the rankings or changing the size of a category based on its popularity. After performing the additional processing the routine determines if there are more categories at step . If so the routine returns to step . If not the routine proceeds to step to perform additional processing which may include identifying if any bonuses are to be awarded based on cumulative point milestones or total points earned within a period of time. The routine then ends at step .

In some embodiments at least some of the types of users may sign up with the rapid answer system and receive a user account. In some embodiments the account may be a more general account as part of other sites and or services provided by the rapid answer system or as part of a federation of sites that the rapid answer system participates in. In addition in some embodiments at least some of the types of users may also register to receive a special purpose account such as a special account for receiving or making payments. In some embodiments each type of user e.g. response provider user requester user has a separate account while in other embodiments the same account may be shared for all or some of the types of users. The account then may hold information about the user including a username and password for user authentication the amount of points earned payment information categories associated with the user enhanced status and rankings.

Requester users may ask questions and responses may be received from response provider users. One or more responses may be used as an answer to a question and some responses e.g. abusive responses may not be used as part of the answer. Potential responses include but are not limited to one or more indications of network accessible resources sites e.g. a URL Uniform Resource Locator or a URI Uniform Resource Identifier where the response provider user found the information book magazine citations database citations phone numbers email addresses and opinions. In addition in some embodiments item provider users that provide products or services may pay money to provide additional responses relating to their products or services. Viewer users may review the answers to previously answered questions. However the type of a user is not mutually exclusive. Thus in some embodiments a user that asks a question about plumbers in Seattle may still answer questions relating to martial arts and or review previously answered questions about solving a margin problem in the Microsoft Word word processing application. In some embodiments a given user may indicate the role e.g. requester user response provider user item provider user viewer user etc. that the user is currently performing in order to access and or receive the appropriate graphical user interface for interacting with the Rapid Answer system. For ease of understanding however the different types of users are referred to as if the various types of users are distinct. Furthermore in some embodiments at least some of the users may be an entity e.g. corporation group association etc. and not an individual person.

Questions and answers to those questions may be gathered via the Rapid Answer system. Various types of questions may be asked via the Rapid Answer system. Questions may in some embodiments be as varied as finding local products or services to determining what foods are healthy to finding reasons for cleaning fuel injectors. Questions include any request for information whether or not the request ends in a question mark or multiple inquires are made within a single question. In addition in some embodiments the topics of at least some of the questions may be restricted. For example in some embodiments only questions about one or more predetermined topics e.g. local products and or services may be asked and answered. In other embodiments questions deemed inappropriate e.g. adult topics and or topics involving potentially illegal activity may be prohibited or restricted e.g. by enforcing age restrictions on access to adult content as appropriate.

A requester user may indicate a question and one or more tags for the question. In some embodiments the Rapid Answer system suggests tags based on term words in the question text tags indicated by the requester user and or metadata associated with the question and or requester user. In some embodiments additional information e.g. summary text an amount of time during which a question may be available and or active for users to provide responses etc. may be supplied by the requester user. The question may be presented to response provider users in order receive responses to the question. Questions may be presented to users in various ways including programmatic notifications via email instant messaging or other suitable method based on term words within the question and or categories associated with the prospective answer to the question. In addition presented questions may be arranged by term words category initial reward type reward value the time the question was made and or the time the questions expire. In some embodiments users may access questions via full text search. In some embodiments at least some of the response provider users may not have the ability to have questions presented to them in all of the previously mentioned manners. In addition the number of response provider users may be limited to a predetermined number thus response provider users may indicate that they are working on a response in some embodiments.

Response provider users may then provide responses to the questions. Factual responses may in some embodiments require the response provider user to acknowledge the source of the information. If clarification is needed to answer a question a response provider user or an item provider user may ask for clarification from the requester user in some embodiments. In some embodiments previous responses from other response provider users may be hidden from other response provider users. When a question is finished at least some of the responses may become an answer to the question and a number of experience points may be awarded for the unique responses to the question. In some embodiments at least some of the responses may not be used in the answer such as responses that are abusive or lame i.e. unhelpful . A question may be considered finished in various ways such as after an indicated time period for the questions has elapsed after a predetermined number of responses or after responses from a predetermined number of response provider users.

Experience points may be awarded for each category. In one embodiment experience points for the question may be determined and then divided by the number of unique responses. Then the points for a unique response may be divided by the number of response provider users that provided the response. In some embodiments the determined point allocation for each of the response provider users is divided by the number of categories associated with the answer. Categories may include in some embodiments one or more associated tags and may be automatically generated from the responses and or tags supplied by both requester users and or response provider users. In addition to awarding experience points the response provider user may in some embodiments be provided with at least a portion of the requester user specified reward or a reward for one or more bonuses e.g. for the best answer best response provider user . Additional details related to experience point allocation are provided elsewhere.

Responses may be presented to the requester user and or viewer users. In some embodiments a user may see responses as they are provided by or received from response provider users. Various other items including advertisements responses from item provider users and or sponsored links may be displayed along with the responses. Additional methods of generating revenue other than advertisements may also be utilized to generate a revenue stream.

In some embodiments a requester user may provide feedback about various responses such as marking the response as lame e.g. on topic but unhelpful or abusive e.g. off topic response . In addition in some embodiments if the response to a question was an opinion the requester user may request one or more follow ups to the opinion. In some embodiments response provider users that provided a response to a question may also provide various types of feedback about the question and or its associated responses before and or after experience points are allocated. For example response provider users may in some embodiments be able to suggest tags vote on a best or even a primary tag for the answer to be used in identifying a category for the answer vote for the best response vote for the best response provider user for a given question or indicate that a response is lame or abusive. In some embodiments other users who did not provide a response to the question may also provide feedback. As a result of user provided feedback the expertise point allocation for the responses may be altered accordingly. Additional details related to feedback are described below.

In some embodiments since at least some individual payouts of cash to for example a response provider user may be small the amount earned may be aggregated until the amount of money earned exceeds a predetermined amount of money e.g. 5.00 . In some embodiments the amount owed the response provider user may be associated with the response provider user s account and include all earnings whether from the revenue sharing initial reward if any and any cash bonuses. In addition in some embodiments instead of awarding cash a non cash equivalent value may be alternatively awarded such as gift certificates or frequent flier miles or other loyalty points . Some or all of the bonuses such as receiving a certain milestone in experience points in a category may be added to money owed the response provider user or given as a non cash gift e.g. gift certificate .

In some embodiments when a requester user submits a question the Rapid Answer system may check to see if the same question has been recently asked and answered. If the system determines that question has been previously asked and answered then the Rapid Answer system may provide the answer to the previously asked question and not present the question to response provider users. In some embodiments as a result no experience points are awarded while in other embodiments bonuses may be awarded to response provider users that previously answered the previously asked question or the revenue stream share for that question adjusted e.g. more revenue allocated for the question .

As noted above some embodiments may interact with or otherwise utilize systems for interacting with human users to supply tasks to be performed and to receive corresponding results. As described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 990 949 some such systems may provide functionality related to obtaining and using information about qualifications of users such as to allow other users to identify and or specify types of users with whom to conduct transactions. In some embodiments qualifications may be automatically determined for response provider users and utilized to determine which response provider users may be provided access to particular questions. For example qualifications may be associated with tags and or categories that are utilized in conjunction with questions responses and answers. As response provider users provide answers and thereby gain experience points and corresponding expertise levels in particular categories they may be granted qualifications associated with those categories which may in turn enable the response provider users to gain access to questions that require such qualifications. In addition requester users may further associate qualifications with provided questions in at least some embodiments such that the provided questions may only be accessed by and or answered by response provider users who have obtained the appropriate qualification. In addition qualifications may be automatically associated with questions based at least in part on the tags and or categories associated with such questions e.g. associate a Java programming qualification with a question that uses the tag Java . Embodiments may also associate qualifications with questions based on other factors such as if the reward offered for a particular question is greater than a predetermined amount e.g. associating qualifications with questions that have rewards greater than 5 where the type of qualification is based on one or more tags associated with the question .

In some embodiments systems for interacting with human users to supply tasks to be performed and to receive corresponding results may be utilized to specify tasks related to questions responses and or answers and assigning such tasks to human users for performance. For example tasks may be specified that consist of categorizing questions and human categorizer users may perform such tasks by choosing appropriate categories for questions and or answers based on associated content metadata and or tags. Such categorizer users may be rewarded in various ways such as with money and or by earning experience points or qualifications related to performing categorization tasks. Other types of tasks to be performed by human users are also contemplated including tasks that consist of editing or otherwise improving the quality of supplied questions and or responses. For example human performance tasks may be generated that include selecting or otherwise editing tags associated with questions or editing the content of questions and or responses to improve grammar or other characteristics.

As previously discussed in some embodiments electronic messages may be used to send commands to the Rapid Answer system. In one example embodiment a non exclusive list of such commands are as follows 

In the table x and y are parameters that may follow a command although in some cases the parameters may be optional. For example confirm may in some embodiments not require a parameter. This list of commands is merely exemplary and in other embodiments more or less commands may be available.

In some embodiments the commands may further be used as part of a message authentication process. For example after a requester user has set up an account with payment information when a requester user needs to buy more questions the requester user may send a message to buy rapid answer.com and in the body of the message type buy XX where XX is the number of questions that the requester user wants to purchase. After the Rapid Answer system receives the message from the requester user the system may send back a confirmation request message to confirm the purchase with the message having a tracking identifier. When the user receives the confirmation request message the user may reply to the message by typing in confirm where is the user s 4 digit PIN. If the user entered the wrong number of questions to buy the user may also send a message with the reject command to prevent the transaction from occurring. When the Rapid Answer system receives this message it matches the tracking identifier and the 4 digit PIN and if both match the system completes the transaction. Such a combination of the tracking identifier and knowledge of the PIN facilitates authentication of the user.

The commands may also be used in other manners in some embodiments. For example a user may be able to search for and buy items via a mobile device. First the user signs up for one or more mobile services and selects a preferred payment option e.g. by placing a credit card on file a preferred delivery address e.g. home address and delivery method e.g. 2 day ground . Afterwards the user may send a message to the Rapid Answer system to find the particular item by typing find item where item is a description of the item e.g. a unique item number such as ISBN or SKU number . The Rapid Answer system receives the message from the user and may send to the user a list of one or more items matching the description and a price for each item. The results may include an item identifier for each item and a tracking identifier. After the user receives the message with the search results the user may select one of the products for purchase. The user purchases the item by replying to the message and typing buy item XXXXX where XXXXX is the item identifier supplied by the Rapid Answer system. The Rapid Answer system then receives the message and attempts to match the tracking number. If tracking number matches the sent tracking identifier for the user then the system sends a confirmation request message that specifies the prospective purchase. The confirmation request message may have another distinct tracking identifier or instead may have the same tracking identifier as in the search result message. After the user receives the confirmation request message the user may reply back by typing confirm where is his her 4 digit PIN. When the Rapid Answer system receives the confirmation message reply back from the user it tries to match the tracking identifier and the 4 digit PIN for the user and if both match proceeds to process the item purchase for the user. The item is then sent to the user s pre selected delivery address e.g. home address via a pre selected delivery method e.g. 2 day ground . Additional functionality such as allowing a mobile user to specify the delivery address and or delivery methods may also be performed.

A user may also in some embodiments be able to pay another user via a mobile device. In such a person to person model users may sign up with a payment service. After signing up with the payment service and supplying at least one payment method a user may send money to another user via messages with the Rapid Answer system. The user may for example send a message to the Rapid Answer system e.g. pay rapid answer.com containing the body pay otheruser domain.com 10 . After the system receives the message the system may send back a confirmation request message with a tracking identifier. The user receives the confirmation request message from the system and may reply to the message by typing in confirm where is the user s 4 digit PIN. When the system receives the confirmation message back from the user it tries to match the tracking identifier and the 4 digit PIN. If the tracking identifier and the 4 digit PIN both match the system may deposit 10 into the account of the other user and obtain the 10 possibly with an additional processing fee from the user making the payment.

Although the previous scenarios were discussed as occurring via the Rapid Answer system in other embodiments some or all the functionality may be provided by other systems such as the systems of online merchants. In addition it will be appreciated that some embodiments may utilize various mechanisms to enhance the security of such payment transactions including capping the amount of money that may be transferred on a per transaction basis e.g. a maximum of 50 per transaction and or per time period e.g. a maximum of 100 per day . Other security mechanisms may include verifying that a generated command message includes information likely to be known by a valid user but unlikely to be known by a malicious user. Such information may include valid tracking identifiers as described in more detail with reference to shared secrets e.g. passwords and or personal information such as mother s maiden name and or reference tokens that indicate predefined payment instructions as described in greater detail with respect to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 200 880 . Also the message may be sent securely such as via HTTP S or via encryption and hashing prior to being sent to from the Rapid Answer system.

As previously mentioned in embodiments where rewards may be allocated to response provider users who provide responses to questions the rewards may be calculated in various manners. For example rewards may be allocated based at least in part on feedback from the requester user who asked a question and or the response provider users who provided responses to the question. Response provider users who provided a response to a question may provide feedback on the responses from other response provider users that provided a response to the question.

As one specific example feedback from requester users and response provider users regarding a response may consist of rating an answer as great good okay unhelpful or abusive. The feedback from the various users may be translated into numbers to be used in creating a normalized rating of the response such as follows great 2 good 1 okay 0 lame 1 and abusive 2. These numbers may then be entered into the formula below to calculate a normalized rating of the response.

As a continuation of the prior example response provider user receives a 0.4 normalized rating and thus receives 5 experience points despite the response being marked as abusive by the requester user. However in some embodiments since the response was marked as abusive the abusive response will nonetheless be tracked and used against response provider user in other manners such as to temporarily or permanently ban response provider user if response provider user gives too many responses marked as abusive by requester users. Continuing to apply the formula for this example response provider user receives a 0.75 rating and has 10 experience points deducted for the response i.e. is allocated 10 experience points .

In some embodiments if there were not at least a predetermined number e.g. three of ratings received then the response by default is deemed to be okay and is awarded 5 experience points. Thus response provider user may be awarded 5 points for the response provider user s response to the question. In addition the response provider user with the highest normalized ratings assuming that it is over a predetermined normalized rating e.g. 0.5 may be determined to be the best response and awarded a bonus of 10 experience points. In the event of a tie the requester user s rating will be utilized to break the tie and if there is still a tie neither response may be determined to be the best response. Penalties e.g. deducting 50 experience points per category tracking the response provider user for possible banning from the Rapid Answer system etc. may also be assessed in some embodiments for failing to submit a response after accepting a question. In some embodiments responses from item provider users may also be rewarded with experience points based on feedback about the item provider user s response and or the item provider user may provide feedback to be used in the allocation of experience points.

In some embodiments various security and or fraud measures may be utilized. For example in some embodiments users may sign in to the Rapid Answer system with a username and password. Various logs of activity may be utilized to prevent and deal with fraud and security breaches. Limits may be placed on the number of questions from the same requester user a response provider user may answer within a set period of time. In addition the same person may not be allowed to both ask a question as a requester user and answer the question as a response provider user.
