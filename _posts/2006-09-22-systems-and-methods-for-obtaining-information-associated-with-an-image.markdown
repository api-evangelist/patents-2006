This application is a continuation in part of application Ser. No. 11 249 505 filed Oct. 14 2005 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention generally relates to decoding an image to obtain information content associated with the image.

Patterns displayed on physical objects can be used to represent digital data. For example one dimensional bar codes have been used on external product packaging to identify a type of the product by a digital identifier. Alternative embodiments use two dimensional patterns to represent digital data. For example a ShotCode implemented by OP3 AB of Sweden is a circular pattern that encodes digital data. This circular pattern can be placed on marketing media such that a person who is interested in the media can photograph the circular pattern to prompt a web browser at the person s disposal to access a particular website.

However those patterns may occupy an area dedicated to providing the digital identifier that cannot be used for other displays. The patterns can also distract the human user s attention from the physical object such as the marketing materials.

In yet another embodiment two dimensional marketing materials themselves are photographed as an image of low resolution pixels using a digital camera on a cellular telephone. The low resolution image is processed to recognize an identity of the two dimensional marketing materials. Based on this identity graphics or other information content can be transmitted to the cellular telephone of a user. However the processing of the two dimensional graphic may not be sufficiently robust to recognize its identity in commercial application.

Thus it is desirable to encode a digital identifier in a pattern on an object that makes efficient use of the surface area of the object and to encode data values associated with the digital identifier. It is further desirable to robustly decode the pattern to determine the digital identifier and the associated data.

A method is provided for decoding an image of a pattern associated with an object to determine a digital identifier and to obtain data. The method comprises receiving a image of a pattern associated with the object. The pattern comprises a sub image and a data tag. The image comprising a plurality of pixels. The method further comprises associating a first sub set of the pixels with the sub image and a second sub set of the pixels with the data tag determining a digital identifier of the sub image based on the first sub set of the pixels and determining a tag value of the data tag based on the second sub set of the pixels.

A system for decoding an image of a pattern associated with an object is provided. The system comprises a processor. The processor is configured to receive an image of a pattern associated with the object. The pattern comprises a sub image and a data tag. The image comprises a plurality of pixels. The processor is further configured to associate a first sub set of the pixels with the sub image and a second sub set of the pixels with the data tag determine a digital identifier of the sub image based on the first sub set of the pixels and determine a tag value of the data tag based on the second sub set of the pixels.

A computer readable medium is provided that contains instructions for configuring a microprocessor to perform a method of decoding an image of a pattern associated with an object. The method comprises receiving an image of a pattern associated with the object. The pattern comprises a sub image and a data tag. The image comprises a plurality of pixels. The method further comprises associating a first sub set of the pixels with the sub image and a second sub set of the pixels with the data tag determining a digital identifier of the sub image based on the first sub set of the pixels and determining a tag value of the data tag based on the second sub set of the pixels.

In one embodiment communications system is a wireless communications system adapted to communicate wirelessly with remote server transmitter is a wireless transmitter and receiver is a wireless receiver.

If decoder is implemented in remote server to determine the digital identifier remotely transmitter of communications system may transmit the sub image either as part of the super image or separately from portable imaging apparatus to remote server . If decoder is implemented in remote server to obtain the tag values from the data tag remotely transmitter of communications system may transmit the data tag either as part of the super image or separately from portable imaging apparatus to remote server . If the image processing functionality is also implemented in remote server then transmitter may transmit the super image to remote server and image processing functionality can isolate and extract the sub image and or the data tag from the super image.

Transmitting the super image to remote server may refer to transmitting either the full area of the super image one or more cropped sections of the super image or the super image after other preselected data has been extracted. For example the super image may be cropped by the image editing software of portable imaging apparatus prior to transmission. Also color information may be removed from the super image before transmission. By cropping or otherwise removing data from the super image content delivery system may be able to more efficiently use transmission bandwidth and data storage resources.

Pattern displayed on physical object may be designed such that a super image of pattern may capture a sub image and one or more data tags . shows an exemplary embodiment of a super image containing a sub image and data tags . Super image may have an outer border that frames a sub frame which in turn frames sub image . A main border may also be provided between outer border and sub frame . Although presents exemplary super image in the shape of a rectangle a pattern e.g. super image or an image e.g. sub image may be presented in any two dimensional shape such as a polygon e.g. triangle square hexagon and the like an ellipse e.g. an oval a circle and the like or any other shape and combination thereof.

Each of outer border and sub frame may present a design or pattern that is optically detectable so as to define an inner area and an outer area the inner area being framed by the design. Outer border and sub frame may be made optically detectable by having an optical attribute that contrasts with an adjacent area within super image . For example outer border may have a brightness of at least a predetermined contrast with an outwardly adjacent area . Sub frame may have a brightness of at least a predetermined contrast with a border area .

In one embodiment main border may include data tags containing machine or computer readable data representations such as a bar code e.g. data tags and human readable text recognizable by an OCR tool e.g. data tag a symbol a pattern a grayscale swatch e.g. data tags and a color swatch and other data representations.

Data tags may be categorized into one or more types according to their location in relation to registration points . Registration points may be points of outer border itself points of main border points of sub frame or points of sub image that have an expected location such as an expected location in relation to points of outer border . For example if pattern is presented as in the shape of a polygon e.g. a rectangle as shown in locations of registration points may be expected at the vertices of sub frame . As another example if pattern is presented in the shape of an ellipse locations of registration points may be expected at the foci of sub frame and one or more points along sub frame .

A vertex data tag e.g. one of data tags and may be positioned adjacent to one of registration points . A side data tag e.g. one of data tags and may be positioned between a plurality of registration points . An unrestricted data tag may be positioned in any location within main border . In one embodiment data tags of different types may overlap data tags of another type. In another embodiment data tags of different types may be restricted from overlapping data tags of another type.

The value of a data tag may be used to indicate the type of pattern object or image e.g. photograph street map movie still text passage and the like . The tag value may also be used to associate other information with the pattern object or image . For example the tag value may be used to determine an International Standard Book Number a publication date a publisher a store identification number a physical location of the object a brand name a discount code an artist name a movie title and the like associated with the pattern object or image .

The value of the data tag may also be used to associate other information content with the pattern object or image . In one embodiment the tag value may provide a link to audio visual and or sensory content associated with the pattern object or image . For example the tag value may correspond to a descriptor of a location of the content e.g. an e mail address a wireless text address a telephone number an MMS address a carrier short code to which information content can be sent and the like a descriptor of a preferred mode for presenting the content e.g. e mail wireless transmission telephone MMS and the like . For instance the tag value may be used to provide a link to an image text streaming or non streaming video streaming or non streaming audio a URL a WAP page an HTML page an XML document an executable program a filename an IP address a telephone number a pointer or other content.

As another example the tag value may provide a descriptor of a service level required to access the content e.g. all basic premium and the like . For instance the tag value may indicate that an access level of premium is required to access an MPEG 3 audio file of a song by a popular artist depicted in pattern .

In one embodiment object may be a book not shown on which pattern is displayed e.g. on the cover or an individual page . The reader may use portable imaging apparatus to capture a super image of the pattern and thereby retrieve content relating to that page e.g. multimedia content text video or the like . For example after the super image has been captured the content delivery system may determine the book s title e.g. The Mouse House and the page number e.g. 5 based on a digital identifier obtained from sub image and or data tags . The content delivery system may also determine a mode of content presentation e.g. MPEG 3 audio and the filename of the corresponding multimedia content based on the values of one or more data tags within pattern . The content delivery system may then retrieve the corresponding multimedia content e.g. an MPEG 3 audio file that narrates words printed on page 5 of The Mouse House based on the digital identifier and or the tag values. In another example the content delivery system may determine that the mode of content presentation is animation based on a tag value obtained from a data tag and may then play an animation corresponding to the individual page of book.

In another embodiment the tag values encoded in data tags may comprise reference or calibration information for processing super image or a portion of super image e.g. sub image . For example data tags may include a black portion and a white portion thereby providing reference color values for black and white. For another example data tags may contain separate portions containing one or more of the primary colors red yellow blue therefore providing reference color values for each of the primary colors. For yet another example data tag may contain four separate portions three of which containing the primary colors and one of which containing white therefore providing reference tag values for each of the primary colors and white.

Image processor may process super image at a first resolution to isolate sub image in a form that can be robustly decoded. Initially image processor may detect outer border at the first resolution. Outer border may then be used to locate registration points of super image . For example based on the location of outer border image processor may determine whether at least a predetermined number e.g. 3 non collinear registration points have been detected within super image . If so then content delivery system may indicate to the user that the super image has been successfully captured. The image processor may then locate sub frame by calculating the displacement values of the detected registration points and comparing the actual locations of the detected registration points in super image to the expected locations of registration points .

Based on the displacement values of registration points image processor may perform keystone correction of sub image . Keystone correction compensates for shape distortion artifacts or other effects that may result from an undesirable angle between a photographic axis that extends from digital camera to pattern on object and a normal axis that is normal to a surface of object at which pattern is displayed. For example if opposite edges in sub image are expected to be parallel and the edges are not actually parallel in sub image sub image can be adjusted to parallelize the edges and thereby at least partially correct the rest of sub image .

Super image may also include an orientation icon that image processor can use to determine an angular orientation of sub image or super image during image processing. For example icon may be located at sub frame at main border or at outer border . Image processor compensates for an undesirable angular orientation of sub image or super image such as by computationally rotating sub image or super image . In one embodiment sub image is re oriented according to the position of icon relative to the expected locations of registration points of super image .

After image processing decoder may receive sub image and decode sub image at a second resolution to determine the digital identifier. The second resolution may be lower than the first resolution whereby the higher first resolution can provide accurate isolation of sub image while the lower second resolution can provide increased robustness in decoding sub image .

The first resolution may refer to the number of pixels in super image . For example in one embodiment the first resolution may be from about 80 80 pixels i.e. about 6 400 pixels to about 4 000 4 000 pixels i.e. about 16 megapixels with any aspect ratio as long as there are from about 80 to about 4 000 pixels in a first dimension and from about 80 to about 4 000 pixels in a second dimension that is substantially orthogonal to the first dimension. The second resolution may refer to the number of tiles in sub image . The second resolution may be lower than the first resolution meaning that the number of tiles in sub image is less than the number of pixels in super image . For example the second resolution may be from about 3 3 tiles i.e. about 9 tiles to about 200 200 tiles i.e. about 40 000 tiles . In one exemplary embodiment provided for the purposes of illustration the first resolution is about 120 80 pixels and the second resolution is about 3 4 tiles such that each tile has a resolution of about 40 20 pixels and there are about 12 tiles. In another exemplary embodiment the first resolution is about 640 480 pixels and the second resolution is about 3 4 tiles.

One or more of tiles may be contiguous and non overlapping having borders that abut the borders of one or more of the other tiles as shown in the exemplary embodiment of . One or more of tiles may also be separated from other tiles such that one or more of pixels of sub image are not contained in one of tiles as shown in the exemplary embodiment of . Furthermore one or more of tiles may be contiguous and have borders that overlap the borders of one or more of the other tiles such as shown in the exemplary embodiment of

Referring to decoder evaluates one or more of the optical attributes of pixels in each of tiles to assign one or more digital bits to the evaluated tile . For example each of tiles may correspond to one or more binary bits individually having values of either 0 or 1 or a digital bit that is based on another numeral system such as a decimal or hexadecimal numeral system. In one exemplary embodiment the optical attribute of pixels comprises brightness which may be evaluated by measuring the red intensity green intensity and blue intensity of each of pixels and averaging these three intensities.

Decoder may evaluate the optical attribute of each of pixels along a spectrum of possible values. For example decoder can determine the distribution of the values associated with pixels for each of the tiles . is an example of a plot of the state of a digital bit as a function of values of an optical attribute along a spectrum where the optical attribute is brightness and the digital bit is a binary bit. Spectrum comprises high and low boundaries such as the high and low boundaries and respectively. Furthermore one or more ranges of the values of the optical attribute are defined along spectrum .

In the exemplary embodiment shown in two ranges and correspond to brightness values. First range of brightness values is associated with a first state referred to as 1 of the binary bit. However second range of brightness values is associated with a second state referred to as 0 of the binary bit. In another embodiment the first and second states of the binary bit could be 0 and 1 respectively.

In one embodiment at least two of ranges and may be separated by one or more guard bands such as the guard band shown in to improve the robustness of the decoding process i.e. to increase the reliability of decoding the intended digital identifier. In for example guard band is shown separating first and second ranges and . Alternatively at least two of ranges and need not be separated by a guard band such that those ranges and are adjacent along spectrum .

Decoder may normalize sub image to improve the robustness with which sub image is decoded. For example sub image may be sampled at some or all of pixels to determine a range of actual values of the optical attribute of those pixels. Based on the sampling either of ranges and of spectrum or the values of pixels of sub image itself can be adjusted to provide a better distribution of the values across ranges and for different pixels . Decoder may also normalize sub image using reference or calibration values obtained from data tags as described above. When the optical attribute is brightness for example this normalization process can compensate for variations in lighting at the time the super image is captured such as when pattern is positioned in direct sunlight or in shadow.

In another exemplary embodiment sub image comprises pixels that can be assigned brightness values e.g. in the spectrum of 0 to 255 where 255 is high boundary and 0 is low boundary . However upon sampling all pixels of sub image actually have brightness values in a spectrum of 0 to 200 . The high and low boundaries and as well as ranges and can be adjusted accordingly to improve the robustness with which sub image is decoded to determine the digital identifier. Alternatively the values of pixels themselves can be scaled up to a spectrum of 0 to 255 .

Pixels in each of tiles are evaluated to determine their placement in one of ranges and between high and low boundaries and . Based on the distribution among ranges and of the values of the optical attribute across pixels of each of tiles a digital bit can be assigned to tile . In addition or alternatively some of pixels may be discounted from the evaluation process through a process referred to as pixel decimation. 

In one embodiment decoder may determine a key sub range of ranges and based on the distribution of the values of the optical attribute among ranges and . For example decoder may calculate the number of pixels in each of ranges and to determine which of ranges and has the highest number of pixels . The range having the highest number of pixels is the key sub range which determines the digital bit assigned to tile . Decoder may associate the binary bit state corresponding with the key sub range whether the key range is first range or second range to individual tile . Furthermore a requirement may be imposed that the key sub range have a number of the values of the optical attribute corresponding to pixels that exceeds the next highest number of the values corresponding to pixels in any other of ranges and by a preselected number or a preselected percentage referred to as a goodness requirement. In another embodiment the range having a median of the values of the optical attribute at pixels of tile is the key range.

Referring to decoder measures the brightness at each of pixels that is in the tile T. For example pixels may have brightness values in a spectrum of from about 0 to about 255 . The individual pixels are evaluated to be either light or dark. For example for brightness values that can range from 0 to 255 pixels having a brightness value in the range from 140 to 255 may be defined as light whereas pixels having a brightness value in the range from 0 to 140 may be defined as dark. If the light pixels outnumber the dark pixels within the tile T a bit of 0 is associated with the tile T. On the other hand if the dark pixels outnumber the light pixels a bit of 1 is associated with the tile T. Since the 12 tiles Tare individually associated with binary bits sub image may be decoded to generate one of 2 or 4096 unique digital identifiers.

Decoder uses the digital bits assigned to tiles to determine a digital identifier. For example the digital bits may be arranged in sequence to compose the digital identifier as an integer. shows an exemplary embodiment of a digital identifier for the image of and based on the binary bits assigned to tiles as shown in . Digital identifier of corresponds to the binary bits of when read left to right and top to bottom thus generating digital identifier having a value of 000101111000 . Pattern may be designed such that sub image can generate one of at least Munique digital identifiers when decoded where M is a base of a digital bit assigned to each of the tiles T such as base for a binary numeral system base for a decimal numeral system etc.

Decoder may use one or more of the digital bits as a parity bit for error correction of the remaining digital bits. For example if the digital bits are binary bits the parity bit may be set to 0 if there are an even number of 1 bits and the parity bit may be set to 1 if there are an odd number of 1 bits or vice versa. In an exemplary embodiment if sub image is divided into 16 tiles the first through fifteenth tiles may each represent a single binary bit that contributes to digital identifier while the sixteenth bit corresponding to the sixteenth tile may be the parity bit.

The sub image may then be extracted from super image and normalized step . Sub image is divided into tiles step . One of tiles is selected step . One or more optical attributes of the selected tile are evaluated step . Based on the evaluation of the optical attributes one or more digital bits such as individually corresponding to the optical attributes are assigned to that tile step . The optical attributes of the remaining tiles are evaluated step . Once the last tile has been assigned its digital bit step digital identifier can be determined from the digital bits step .

Decoder may look up digital identifier to locate information content associated with digital identifier . For example decoder may associate digital identifier with information content by identifying a location that makes information content accessible. The location may comprise for example a memory address filename IP address uniform resource locator URL or telephone number. Decoder may also obtain tag values from data tags to determine information content associated with digital identifier . For example decoder may obtain tag values from data tags to identify a location to access information content associated with digital identifier .

A mapping between one or more digital identifiers and locations of sets of information content associated with those digital identifiers is provided. For example the digital identifiers may be mapped to the sets of information content in either a one to one relationship or a many to one relationship. is a table showing an exemplary embodiment of a mapping the table having a column for digital identifiers and another column for the filenames of information content . In addition to identifying information content decoder may log digital identifier to maintain a record of decoding instances such as for marketing purposes.

Decoder may further associate digital identifier with a communication protocol used to deliver information content . Decoder may also obtain tag values from data tags to determine a communication protocol used to deliver information content associated with digital identifier . The communication protocol may comprise for example e mail multimedia messaging service MMS enhanced messaging service EMS short messaging service SMS WAP push application push such as in a Java 2 Platform Micro Edition push registry a standard form of telephony or standard internet protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol TCP IP User Datagram Protocol UDP HTTP and File Transfer Protocol FTP . Remote server may access the mapping between digital identifiers and the sets of information content and or communication protocols associated with those digital identifiers . Remote server may use the tag values or look up digital identifier in the mapping to find information content associated with digital identifier .

If digital identifier is not matched to any set of information content content delivery system can present a failure message to the user that sub image could not be recognized or that no relevant information was found. Alternatively sub image can be transferred to a technician who may edit and return sub image or visually extract digital identifier from sub image . In yet another version a preselected set of information content other than the failure message is delivered when digital identifier cannot be matched.

Image processor and or decoder may repeatedly process and or decode respectively super image or sub image to improve the determination of digital identifier . In one illustrative example the parity bit indicates an error in the digital identifier that is determined as a result of the decoding process. As a result the image processing or decoding process may be successively altered to attempt to eliminate the error. For example if object that displays pattern is in an undesirably dark or undesirably bright space the normalization process described above as part of the decoding process may be re iterated for different values of ranges and or different values of high and low boundaries and . One or more of the decoding steps may also be re iterated for different shapes or sizes of tiles .

Content supplier uses the location of information content from decoder to retrieve and deliver information content . When content supplier is implemented in remote server content supplier may deliver information content by transmitting information content to portable imaging apparatus or third party apparatus . Content supplier may also detect one or more characteristics such as a device type or capability of portable imaging apparatus or third party apparatus to optimize transmission or type of information content .

When content supplier is implemented in remote server content supplier may send information content comprising an activation message also referred to as a wake up message to portable imaging apparatus . The activation message may comprise for example one or more of a message to a push registry on a Java 2 Platform Micro Edition J2ME device or Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW device of portable imaging apparatus a TCP IP message an HTTP request a text message and a UDP packet. Receipt of the activation message may activate portable imaging apparatus to deliver additional preselected information content to the user. For example portable imaging apparatus may retrieve information content that is locally stored or stored on remote server . In one exemplary embodiment portable imaging apparatus comprises a telephonic device such as a cell phone and receipt of the activation messages initiates a telephone call from portable imaging apparatus to a live operator or an automated phone tree.

A plurality of different objects may be designed to encode the same digital identifier . This flexibility allows a preselected degree of artistic autonomy in the design of pattern and or image displayed on object . For example a promotion for a new movie could include several different posters displaying different patterns and or images all of the posters encoding the same digital identifier that can for example cause a PDA to load an internet website dedicated to providing multimedia content about the movie.

By adjusting characteristics of tiles or selecting the optical attribute used to determine digital identifier decoder can be made desirably robust and the degree and nature of artistic flexibility can be selected for a given application. For example characteristics of the tiles such as the number of pixels included in each of tiles or the number shapes or locations of tiles in sub image can be adjusted. Thus a unique digital identifier can be associated with object while desirably allowing for creative latitude in the design of pattern and or image on object .

Performing image processing at the higher first resolution to process super image and isolate sub image and then performing decoding of sub image at the lower second resolution enhances the robustness of the process by which digital identifier is determined while also permitting substantial artistic flexibility in the design of pattern and or image on object .
