The invention relates to hardware software and electronic service components and systems to provide large scale reliable and secure foundations for distributed databases and content management systems combining unstructured and structured data and allowing post input reorganization to achieve a high degree of flexibility.

One can envision highly distributed databases capable of managing simultaneous participation by billions of users and highly distributed content management systems coordinating the contributions of billions routinely integrating the contributions of both people and machines and spanning multiple organizations firms and the globe itself. One can imagine flexible systems where data is input in unstructured as well as structured forms and subsequent users can access and present the data in flexible evolving forms not anticipated at the point of data entry. Massively parallel processing envisioned as occurring inside one machine or cluster of machines was once the premier challenge facing the database and content management community. The new challenge in our view is massively parallel and flexible participation of billions.

In order to accomplish this the world will need a new business ecosystem. Advances in information technology often show three related themes that may be thought of as analogous to the biological processes of expansion of and species succession in natural ecosystems. First non expert end users will be empowered to solve problems. Second technology platforms will be created that modularize technology contributions into niches. The niche contributions interrelate with each other through standard protocols and interfaces that are made open to technologists and the general public so that tens hundreds and sometimes millions of innovators can contribute to the resulting business ecosystem each according to his or her choice creativity and competence. In turn new niches will be established opened up and will bring in further new contributors and contributions.

As the business ecosystem expands some specific technological components will become critical enablers to the continuing advance of the whole. Issues of flexibility scale reliability and security will become vital to the community. These vital components for example microprocessors storage controllers and network devices in the personal computer ecosystem will require systematic application of research and development capital investment and coordination with industry partners in order that the whole ecosystem can progress. If the world is to make real the vision of the flexible participation of billions there are a number of core components and systems that have not been invented and will need to be invented.

The flexible participation of billions has been presaged by blogging that is the act of individuals creating Web sites and adding to them more or less daily. By dramatically increasing production and sharing of Web based content the blogging movement now produces a virtual river of content available continuously and with global circulation. Just as word processing empowered millions to create their own documents blogging software has made it relatively easy for millions to produce their own Web sites and keep them continually updated. By the promotion of a simple underlying standard for sharing text and other media blogging has popularized the syndication or passing on of content borrowed from others extending the reach of any given blogger and further increasing the total quantity of information in circulation.

A number of companies have emerged as niche players targeting various aspects of large scale distributed databases content management and group participation. For example some companies such as FeedDemon NewsGator myYahoo Yahoo and Bloglines have focused on client side aggregation and presentation. Companies such as Technorati Google and Feedster have focused on the complementary services of searching for data feeds of interest. Other companies have focused on technologies for providing syndicated data streams such as SixApart Drupal TypePad Flickr Picasa Google and Blogger Google . Other companies have positioned themselves as content providers including new companies such as Engadget Weblogs Inc. Topix.net and MySpace as well as established media companies such as the New York Times and BBC. Of course various generic Internet technologies are also relevant to the rapidly growing weblog data flow such as BitTorrent or Akamai s EdgePlatform.

While offering significant advancement in terms of experiences such as sharing news music videos and other items as well as enabling players of games to interact with each other individually and in groups the value chain is weak fragmented and closed to interoperability among contributors in many areas. The value chain will benefit from both improved contributions in specific functions or niches as well as a more comprehensive overall vision of a possible flexible participations of billions ecosystem additional niches layers and modules of functionality recast functionality among modules rationalization of protocols and interfaces among modules and custom combinations of functions that establish end to end solutions for specific purposes. For example available services are weak in presentation search signal and network routing. Aggregators that centralize content use display formats that are widely criticized despite a general agreement among users that they improve over conventional search engine displays. Storage of most blog content is in proprietary isolated data sets controlled by blog service operators and the data cannot be easily restructured or even moved from one provider to another. In their current form services fail to provide enterprise class features such as security privacy data integrity and quality of service.

There remains a vital need for components and services that explicitly address the challenge of enabling the flexible participation of billions and that are capable of levels of scale reliability security and flexibility as yet unrealized and perhaps unimagined. There is a need for a new global business ecosystem within which innovation by millions of people will be embraced in order to meet the challenge. In order to stimulate the formation and rapid evolution of such a business ecosystem there will have to be systematic development of general purpose software systems and protocols specifically engineered to enable the flexible participation of billions.

The terms feed data feed data stream and the like as well as the S definition described further below as used herein are intended to refer interchangeably to syndicated data feeds and or descriptions of such feeds. While RSS is one popular example of a syndicated data feed any other source of news or other items may be used with the systems described herein such as the outlining markup language OPML these terms should be given the broadest possible meaning unless a narrow sense is explicitly provided or clear from the context. Similarly terms such as item news item post message and the like as well as the S messages described further below are intended to refer to items within a data feed and may contain text and or binary data encoding any digital media including still or moving images audio application specific file formats and so on. These attachments or enclosures may encapsulate non syndicated content from any source or having any format for association with a syndicated medium such as a feed.

The term syndication is intended to refer to publication republication or other distribution of feeds data feeds or data streams as described above or any other content using any suitable technology including RSS and any extensions or modifications thereto such as the enhanced syndication functions and features described below as well as any other publish subscribe or similar technology that may be suitably adapted to the methods and systems described herein. Syndicated is intended to describe content in syndication.

Various embodiments of the present invention are described below including certain embodiments relating particularly to RSS feeds and other syndicated data streams. It should be appreciated however that the present invention is not limited to any particular protocol for data feeds and that the various embodiments discussed explicitly herein are primarily for purposes of illustration. Thus the term syndication generally and references to RSS specifically should be understood to include for example RDF RSS v 0.90 0.91 0.9x 1.0 and 2.0 variously attributable to Netscape UserLand Software and other individuals and organizations as well as Atom from the AtomEnabled Alliance and any other similar formats as well as non conventional syndication formats that can be adapted for syndication such as OPML. Still more generally while RSS technology is described and RSS terminology is used extensively throughout it will be appreciated that the various concepts discussed herein may be usefully employed in a variety of other contexts. For example various privacy and identity techniques described herein could be usefully combined with HTML Web content rather than RSS based XML data. Similarly some of the branding and advertising techniques described herein may be usefully combined with list servers bulletin boards or other Internet news sources. Thus it will be understood that the embodiments described herein are provided by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventive concepts disclosed herein.

As shown in a network may include a plurality of clients and servers connected via an internetwork . Any number of clients and servers may participate in such a system . The system may further include one or more local area networks LAN interconnecting clients through a hub in for example a peer network such as a wired or wireless Ethernet network or a local area network server in for example a client server network . The LAN may be connected to the internetwork through a gateway which provides security to the LAN and ensures operating compatibility between the LAN and the internetwork . Any data network may be used as the internetwork and the LAN .

In one aspect of the systems described herein a device within the internetwork such as a router or on an enterprise level a gateway or other network edge or switching device may cache popular data feeds to reduce redundant traffic through the internetwork . In other network enhancements clients may be enlisted to coordinate sharing of data feeds using techniques such as those employed in a BitTorrent peer to peer network. In the systems described herein these and other techniques generally may be employed to improve performance of an RSS or other data feed network.

In one embodiment the internetwork is the Internet and the World Wide Web provides a system for interconnecting clients and servers in a communicating relationship through the Internet . The internetwork may also or instead include a cable network and at least one of the clients may be a set top box cable ready game console or the like. The internetwork may include other networks such as satellite networks the Public Switched Telephone Network WiFi networks WiMax networks cellular networks and any other public private or dedicated networks that might be used to interconnect devices for transfer of data.

An exemplary client may include a processor a memory e.g. RAM a bus which couples the processor and the memory a mass storage device e.g. a magnetic hard disk or an optical storage disk coupled to the processor and the memory through an I O controller and a network interface coupled to the processor and the memory such as a modem digital subscriber line DSL card cable modem network interface card wireless network card or other interface device capable of wired fiber optic or wireless data communications. One example of such a client is a personal computer equipped with an operating system such as Microsoft Windows XP UNIX or Linux along with software support for Internet communication protocols. The personal computer may also include a browser program such as Microsoft Internet Explorer Netscape Navigator or FireFox to provide a user interface for access to the internetwork . Although the personal computer is a typical client the client may also be a workstation mobile computer Web phone VOIP device television set top box interactive kiosk personal digital assistant wireless electronic mail device or other device capable of communicating over the Internet. As used herein the term client is intended to refer to any of the above described clients or other client devices and the term browser is intended to refer to any of the above browser programs or other software or firmware providing a user interface for navigating an internetwork such as the Internet.

An exemplary server includes a processor a memory e.g. RAM a bus which couples the processor and the memory a mass storage device e.g. a magnetic or optical disk coupled to the processor and the memory through an I O controller and a network interface coupled to the processor and the memory. Servers may be clustered together to handle more client traffic and may include separate servers for different functions such as a database server an application server and a Web presentation server. Such servers may further include one or more mass storage devices such as a disk farm or a redundant array of independent disk RAID system for additional storage and data integrity. Read only devices such as compact disk drives and digital versatile disk drives may also be connected to the servers. Suitable servers and mass storage devices are manufactured by for example Compaq IBM and Sun Microsystems. Generally a server may operate as a source of content and provide any associated back end processing while a client is a consumer of content provided by the server . However it should be appreciated that many of the devices described above may be configured to respond to remote requests thus operating as a server and the devices described as servers may operate as clients of remote data sources. In contemporary peer to peer networks and environments such as RSS environments the distinction between clients and servers blurs. Accordingly as used herein the term server as used herein is generally intended to refer to any of the above described servers or any other device that may be used to provide content such as RSS feeds in a networked environment.

In one aspect a client or server as described herein may provide OPML specific functionality or more generally functionality to support a system using outlining grammar or markup language with processing storage search routing and the like.

For example the network may include an OPML or RSS router. While the following discussion details routing of OPML content it will be understood that the system described may also or instead be employed for RSS or any other outlined or syndicated content. The network may include a plurality of clients that are OPML users and a number of servers that are OPML sources connected via an internetwork . Any number of clients and servers may participate in such a network . A device within the internetwork such as a router or on an enterprise level a gateway or other network edge or switching device may cache popular data feeds to reduce redundant traffic through the internetwork . In other network enhancements clients may be enlisted to coordinate sharing of data feeds using techniques such as those employed in a BitTorrent peer to peer network. In the systems described herein these and other techniques generally may be employed to improve performance of an OPML data network.

A router generally may be understood as a computer networking device that forwards data packets across an internetwork through a process known as routing. A router may act as a junction between two networks transferring data packets between them and validating that information is sent to the correct location. Routing most typically is associated with Internet Protocol IP however specialized routers exist for routing particular types of data such as ADSL routers for asynchronously routing signals across digital subscriber lines. An OPML router may route data across an internetwork such as the Internet which may include data in OPML format. In particular the OPML router may be configured to route data in response to or in correspondence with the structure or the content of an OPML document that is various species of OPML router may be provided that correspond to user developed outline structures in OPML. For example a financial services OPML outline may correspond to a financial services OPML router that is configured to route financial services data packets among constituent networks of one or more financial services institutions.

An OPML router may use a configuration table also known as a routing table to determine the appropriate route for sending a packet including an OPML data packet. The configuration table may include information on which connections lead to particular groups of addresses connection priorities and rules for handling routine and special types of network traffic. In embodiments the configuration table is dynamically configurable in correspondence to the incoming structure of an OPML data packet that is an OPML structure may be provided that includes routing instructions that are automatically executed by the OPML router. In other embodiments a configuration table is configured to route particular portions of an OPML structured document to particular addresses. In embodiments an OPML router includes rules that can be triggered by OPML content such as rules for prioritizing nodes rules for routing OPML content to particular locations and the like. The rules may be triggered by the structure of an OPML document the title or one or more content items within the OPML document.

In the process of transferring data between networks an OPML router may perform translations of various protocols between the two networks including for example translating data from one data format to another such as taking RSS input data and outputting data in another format. In embodiments the OPML router may also protect networks from one another by preventing the traffic on one from unnecessarily spilling over to the other or it may perform a security function by using rules that limit the access that computers from outside the network may have to computers inside the network. The security rules may be triggered by the content of the OPML document the structure of an OPML document or other features such as the author title or the like. For example an OPML router may include an authentication facility that requires an OPML document to contain a password a particular structure an embedded code or the like in order to be routed to a particular place. Such a security feature can protect networks from each other and can be used to enable features such as version control.

OPML routers may be deployed in various network contexts and locations. An OPML edge router may connect OPML clients to the Internet. An OPML core router may serve solely to transmit OPML and other data among other routers. Data traveling over the Internet whether in the form of a Web page a downloaded file or an e mail message travels over a packet switching network. In this system the data in a message or file is broken up into packages approximately 1 500 bytes long. Each of these packages has a wrapper that includes information on the sender s address the receiver s address the package s place in the entire message and how the receiving computer can be sure that the package arrived intact. Each data package called a packet is then sent off to its destination via the best available route. In embodiments the OPML router determines the best available route taking into account the structure of the OPML document including the need to maintain associations among packets. A selected route may be taken by all packets in the message or only a single packet in a message. By packaging data in this manner a network can continuously balance the data load on its equipment. For example if one component of a network is overloaded or malfunctioning data packets may be routed for processing on other network equipment that has a lighter data load and or is properly working. An OPML router may also route OPML content according to semantic structure. For example an OPML router configured to handle medical records may route X Rays to an expert in reading X Rays while routing insurance information to another department of a hospital.

Routers may reconfigure the paths that data packets take because they look at the information surrounding the data packet and can communicate with each other about line conditions within the network such as delays in receiving and sending data and the overall traffic load on a network. An OPML router may communicate with other OPML routers to determine for example whether the entire structure of an OPML document was preserved or whether recipients of a particular component in fact received the routed component. Again the OPML document itself may include a structure for routing it. A router may also locate preferential sources for OPML content using caching and other techniques. Thus for example where an OPML document includes content from an external reference the external reference may be a better source for that portion of the OPML document based upon an analysis of e.g. network congestion geographic proximity and the like.

An OPML router may use a subnet mask to determine the proper routing for a data packet. The subnet mask may employ a model similar to IP addressing. This tells the OPML router that all messages in which the sender and receiver have an address sharing the first three groups of numbers are on the same network and shouldn t be sent out to another network. For example if a computer at address 15.57.31.40 sends a request to the computer at 15.57.31.52 the router will match the first three groups in the IP addresses 15.57.31 and keep the packet on the local network. OPML routers may be programmed to understand the most common network protocols. This programming may include information regarding the format of addresses the format of OPML documents the number of bytes in the basic package of data sent out over the network and the method which insures all the packages reach their destination and get reassembled including into the structure of an OPML document if desired.

There are two major routing algorithms in common use global routing algorithms and decentralized routing algorithms. In decentralized routing algorithms each router has information about the routers to which it is directly connected but does not know about every router in the network. These algorithms are also known as DV distance vector algorithms. In global routing algorithms every router has complete information about all other routers in the network and the traffic status of the network. These algorithms are also known as LS link state algorithms. In LS algorithms every router identifies the routers that are physically connected to them and obtains their IP addresses. When a router starts working it first sends a HELLO packet over the network. Each router that receives this packet replies with a message that contains its IP address. All routers in the network measure the delay time or any other important parameters of the network such as average traffic for its neighboring routers within the network. In order to do this the routers send echo packets over the network. Every router that receives these packets replies with an echo reply packet. By dividing round trip time by two routers can compute the delay time. This delay time includes both transmission and processing times i.e. the time it takes the packets to reach the destination and the time it takes the receiver to process them and reply . Because of this inter router communication each OPML router within the network knows the structure and status of the network and can use this information to select the best route between two nodes of a network.

The selection of the best available route between two nodes on a network may be done using an algorithm such as the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm. In this algorithm an OPML router based on information that has been collected from other OPML routers builds a graph of the network. This graph shows the location of OPML routers in the network and their links to each other. Every link is labeled with a number called the weight or cost. This number is a function of delay time average traffic and sometimes simply the number of disparate links between nodes. For example if there are two links between a node and a destination the OPML router chooses the link with the lowest weight.

Closely related to the function of OPML routers OPML switches may provide another network component that improves data transmission speed in a network. OPML switches may allow different nodes a network connection point typically a computer of a network to communicate directly with one another in a smooth and efficient manner. Switches that provide a separate connection for each node in a company s internal network are called LAN switches. Essentially a LAN switch creates a series of instant networks that contain only the two devices communicating with each other at that particular moment. An OPML switch may be configured to route data based on the OPML structure of that data.

In one embodiment an OPML router may be a one armed router used to route packets in a virtual LAN environment. In the case of a one armed router the multiple attachments to different networks are all over the same physical link. OPML routers may also function as an Internet gateway e.g. for small networks in homes and offices such as where an Internet connection is an always on broadband connection like cable modem or DSL.

The network may also or instead include an OPML server as described in greater detail below. OPML which may for example be encapsulated within an RSS data feed may contain one or more RSS channel identifiers or items or may be a separate document has the general format shown in the OPML specification hosted at www.opml.org spec the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. The structure generally includes OPML delimiters general authorship and creation data formatting viewing data if any and a series of outline entries according to a knowledge structure devised by the author.

An OPML server may be provided for manipulating OPML content. The OPML server may provide services and content to clients using for example a Web interface an API an XML processing interface an RSS feed an OPML renderer and the like.

The OPML server may for example provide a search engine service to visitors. Output from the OPML server may be an OPML file an HTML file or any other file suitable for rendering to a client device or subsequent processing. The file may for example have a name that explicitly contains the search query from which it was created in order to facilitate redistribution modification recreation synchronization updating and storage of the OPML file. A user may also manipulate the file such as by adding or removing outline elements representing individual search results or by reprioritizing or otherwise reorganizing the results and the user may optionally store the revised search as a new OPML file. Thus in one aspect the OPML server may create new original OPML content based upon user queries submitted thereto. In a sense this function is analogous to the function of aggregators in an RSS syndication system where new content may be dynamically created from a variety of different sources and republished in a structured form.

The OPML server may more generally provide a front end for an OPML database that stores OPML content. The OPML database may store OMPL data in a number of forms such as by casting the OPML structure into a corresponding relational database where each OPML file is encapsulated as one or more records. The OPML database may also store links to external OPML content or may traverse OPML content through any number of layers and store data files and the like externally referenced in OPML documents. Thus for example where an OPML file references an external OPML file the external OPML file may be retrieved by the database and parsed and stored. The external OPML file may in turn reference other external OPML files that may be similarly processed to construct within the database an entire OPML tree. The OMPL database may also or instead store OPML files as simple text or in any number of formats optimized for searching such as a number of well known techniques used by large scale search engines Google AltaVista and the like or for OPML processing or for any other purpose s . The OPML database may provide coherency for formation of an OPML network among an array of clients and servers where content within the network is structured according to user created OPML outlines.

The OPML server may provide a number of functions or services related to OPML content. For example the OPML server may permit a user to publish OPML content either at a hosted site or locally from a user s computer. The OPML server may provide a ping service for monitoring updates of OPML content. The OPML server may provide a validation service to validate content according to the OPML specification. The OPML server may provide a search service or function which may permit searching against a database of OPML content or it may provide user configurable spidering capabilities to search for OPML content across a wide area network. The OPML server may provide an interface for browsing or more generally navigating and or reading OPML content. The OPML server may provide tools for creating editing and or managing OPML content.

The OPML server may provide a number of complementary functions or services to support OPML based transactions content management and the like. In one aspect a renderer or converter may be provided to convert between a structured format such as OPML and a presentation format such as PowerPoint and display the respective forms. While the converter may be used with OPML and PowerPoint it should be understood that the converter may be usefully employed with a variety of other structured hierarchical or outlined formats and a variety of presentation formats or programs. For example the presentation format may include Portable Document Format Flash Animation electronic books a variety of Open Source alternatives to PowerPoint e.g. OpenOffice.org s Presenter KDE s KPresenter HTML Slidy and so forth whether or not they are PowerPoint compatible. The structured format may include OPML an MS Word outline simple text or any other structured content as well as files associated with leaf nodes thereof such as audio visual moving picture text spreadsheet chart table graphic or any other format any of which may be rendered in association with the structured format and or converted between a structured format and a presentation format It will also be understood that the converter may be deployed on a client device for local manipulation processing and or republication of content.

The OPML database may for example operate through the OPML server to generate monitor and or control spiders that locate OPML content. A spider may upon identification of a valid OPML file retrieve the file and process it into the database. A spider may also process an OPML file to identify external references systematically traversing an entire OPML tree. A spider may be coordinated using known techniques to identify redundant references within a hierarchy. A spider may also differentiate processing according to e.g. structure content location file types metadata and the like. The user interface described below may also include one or more tools for configuring spiders including a front end for generating initial queries displaying results and tagging results with any suitable metadata.

By way of example and not of limitation medical records may be stored as OPML files either within the database or in a distributed fashion among numerous locations across the OPML network. Thus for example assorted X Ray data may be maintained in one location MRI data in another location patient biographical data in another location and clinical notes in another location. These data may be entirely decoupled from individual patients thus offering a degree of security privacy and optionally may include references to other content such as directories of other types of data directories of readers or interpretive metadata for understanding or viewing records and the like. Separately OPML files may be created to provide structure to the distributed data. For example a CT Scan OPML master record may index the locations of all CT Scan records which may be useful for example for studies or research relating to aggregated CT Scan data. This type of horizontal structure may be captured in one or more OPML records which may themselves be hierarchical. Thus for example one OPML file may identify participating hospitals by external reference to OPML records for those hospitals. Each hospital may provide a top level OPML file that identifies OPML records that are available which may in turn identify all CT Scan records maintained at that hospital. The CT Scan master record may traverse the individual hospital OPML records to provide a flattened list of CT Scan records available in the system. As another example an OPML file may identify medical data for a particular patient. This OPML file may traverse records of any number of different hospitals or other medical institutions or it may directly identify particular records where for example concerns about confidentiality cause institutions to strip any personally identifying data from records. For certain applications it may be desirable to have a central registry of data so that records such as patient data are not inadvertently lost due to for example data migration within a particular hospital.

Thus in one embodiment there is generally disclosed herein a pull based data management system in which atomic units of data are passively maintained at any number of network accessible locations while structure is imposed on the data through atomic units of relationship that may be arbitrarily defined through OPML or other grammars. The source data may be selectively pulled and organized according to user defined OPML definitions. The OPML server and OPML database may enable such a system by providing a repository for organization and search of source data in the OPML network. Traversing OPML trees to fully scope an outline composed of a number of nested OPML outlines may be performed by a client or may be performed by the OPML server either upon request from a client for a particular outline or continually in a manner that insures integrity of external reference links.

In another aspect there is disclosed herein a link maintenance system for use in an OPML network. In general a link maintenance system may function to insure integrity of external references contained within OPML files. Broken links which may result for example from deletion or migration of source content may be identified and addressed in a number of ways. For example a search can be performed using the OPML server and OPML database for all OPML files including a reference to the missing target. Additionally the OPML server and or OPML database may include a registry of content sources including an e mail contact manager administrator of outside sources. Notification of the broken link including a reference to the content may be sent to all owners of content. Optionally the OPML server may automatically modify content to delete or replace the reference assuming the OPML server has authorization to access such content. The OPML server may contact the owner of the missing content. The message to the owner may include a request to provide an alternative link which may be forwarded to owners of all content that references the missing content. If the referenced subject matter has been fully indexed by the OPML server and or OPML database the content may itself be reconstructed and a replacement link to the location of the reconstructed content provided. Various combinations of reconstruction and notification such as those above may be applied to maintain the integrity of links in OPML source files indexed in the database. In various embodiments the links may be continuously verified and updated or the links may be updated only when an OPML document with a broken link is requested by a client and processed or traversed by the client or the OPML server in response.

The OPML server may provide a client accessible user interface to view items in a data stream or OMPL outline. The user interface may be presented for example through a Web page viewed using a Web browser or through an outliner or outline viewer specifically adapted to display OPML content. In general an RSS or OPML file may be converted to HTML for display at a Web browser of a client . For example the source file on a server may be converted to HTML using a Server Side Include SSI to bring the content into a template by iterating through the XML RSS internal structure. The resulting HTML may be viewed at a client or posted to a different server along with other items. The output may also or instead be provided in OPML form for viewing through an OPML renderer. Thus feeds and items may be generally mixed shared forwarded and the like in a variety of formats.

Again it is noted that specific references to OPML and RSS above are not intended to be limiting and more generally should be understood as references to any outlining syndication or other grammar suitable for use with the systems described herein.

Focusing now on the internetwork one embodiment is the Internet. The structure of the Internet is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and includes a network backbone with networks branching from the backbone. These branches in turn have networks branching from them and so on. The backbone and branches are connected by routers bridges switches and other switching elements that operate to direct data through the internetwork . For a more detailed description of the structure and operation of the Internet one may refer to The Internet Complete Reference by Harley Hahn and Rick Stout published by McGraw Hill 1994. However one may practice the present invention on a wide variety of communication networks. For example the internetwork can include interactive television networks telephone networks wireless voice or data transmission systems two way cable systems customized computer networks Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks and so on. Clients may access the internetwork through an Internet Service Provider ISP not shown or through a dedicated DSL service ISDN leased lines t1 lines OC3 lines digital satellite service cable modem service or any other connection or through an ISP providing same.

In its present deployment as the Internet the internetwork includes a worldwide computer network that communicates using the well defined Transmission Control Protocol TCP and Internet Protocol IP to provide transport and network services. Computer systems that are directly connected to the Internet each have a unique IP address. The IP address consists of four one byte numbers although a planned expansion to sixteen bytes is underway with IPv6 . To simplify Internet addressing the Domain Name System DNS was created. The DNS allows users to access Internet resources with a simpler alphanumeric naming system. A DNS name consists of a series of alphanumeric names separated by periods. When a domain name is used the computer accesses a DNS server to obtain the explicit four byte IP address. It will be appreciated that other internetworks may be used with the invention. For example the internetwork may be a wide area network a local area network a campus area network or corporate area network. The internetwork may be any other network used to communicate data such as a cable broadcast network.

To further define the resources on the Internet the Uniform Resource Locator system was created. A Uniform Resource Locator URL is a descriptor that specifically defines a protocol for an Internet resource along with its location. URLs have the following format 

In an exemplary embodiment a browser executing on one of the clients retrieves a Web document at an address from one of the servers via the internetwork and displays the Web document on a viewing device e.g. a screen. A user can retrieve and view the Web document by entering or selecting a link to a URL in the browser. The browser then sends an http request to the server that has the Web document associated with the URL. The server responds to the http request by sending the requested Web document to the client . The Web document is an HTTP object that includes plain text ASCII conforming to the HyperText Markup Language HTML . Other markup languages are known and may be used on appropriately enabled browsers and servers including the Dynamic HyperText Markup Language DHTML the Extensible Markup Language XML the Extensible Hypertext Markup Language XHML and the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML .

Each Web document usually contains hyperlinks to other Web documents. The browser displays the Web document on the screen for the user and the hyperlinks to other Web documents are emphasized in some fashion such that the user can identify and select each hyperlink. To enhance functionality a server may execute programs associated with Web documents using programming or scripting languages such as Perl C C C or Java or a Common Gateway Interface CGI script to access applications on the server. A server may also use server side scripting languages such as ColdFusion from MacroMedia or PHP. These programs and languages may perform back end functions such as order processing database management and content searching. A Web document may also contain or include references to small client side applications or applets that are transferred from the server to the client along with a Web document and are executed locally by the client . Java is one popular example of a programming language used for applets. The text within a Web document may further include non displayed scripts that are executable by an appropriately enabled browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript or Visual Basic Script. Browsers may further be enhanced with a variety of helper applications to interpret various media including still image formats such as JPEG and GIF document formats such as PS and PDF motion picture formats such as AVI and MPEG animated media such as Flash media and sound formats such as MP3 and MIDI. These media formats along with a growing variety of proprietary media formats may be used to enrich a user s interactive and audio visual experience as each Web document is presented through the browser. The term page as used herein is intended to refer to the Web document described above as well as any of the above described functional or multimedia content associated with the Web document.

In general operation a server may provide a data stream to a client . In an exemplary embodiment the data stream may be a syndicated data stream such as RSS an XML grammar for sharing data through the Web. An RSS enabled server may include an RSS file with a title and description of items to be syndicated. As with simple HTML documents the RSS file may be hand coded or computer generated. The first line of an RSS file may contain an XML declaration of the form 

While not strictly required this declaration may improve version compatibility. The next item in an RSS file may be a Document Type Declaration DTD that identifies the file as an RSS document 

The RSS element is the root of top level element of an RSS file. The RSS element must specify the version attribute in this example version 0.91 . It may also contain an encoding attribute the default is UTF 8 

The root element is the top level element that contains the rest of an XML document. An RSS element may contain a channel with a title the name of the channel description short description of the channel link HTML link to the channel Web site language language encoding of the channel such as en us for U.S. English and one or more item elements. A channel may also contain the following optional elements 

A channel may contain an image or logo. In RSS the image element contains the image title and the URL of the image itself. The image element may also include the following optional elements a link a URL that the image links to a width a height and a description additional text displayed with the image . There may also be a text input element for an HTML text field. The text input element may include a title label for a submit button description name and link to send input . The link may enable richer functionality such as allowing a user to submit search terms send electronic mail or perform any other text based function.

Once defined in this manner a channel may contain a number of items although some services e.g. Netscape Netcenter may limit the number. In general the item elements provide headlines and summaries of the content to be shared. New items may be added either manually or automatically such as through a script by appending them to the RSS file.

The content source may provide any electronic content including newspaper articles Web magazine articles academic papers government documents such as court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates or the like opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analysis current events bulletins and the like. The content may include text formatting layout graphics audio files image files movie files word processing files spreadsheet files presentation files electronic documents HTML files executable files scripts multi media relational databases data from relational databases and or any other content type or combination of types suitable for syndication through a network. The content source may be any commercial media provider s such as newspapers news services e.g. Reuters or Bloomberg or individual journalists such as syndicated columnists. The content source may also be from commercial entities such as corporations non profit corporations charities religious organizations social organizations or the like as well as from individuals with no affiliation to any of the foregoing. The content source may be edited as with news items or automated as with data feeds such as stock tickers sports scores weather conditions and so on. While written text is commonly used in data feeds it will be appreciated that any digital media may be binary encoded and included in an item of a data feed such as RSS. For example data feeds may include audio moving pictures still pictures executable files application specific files e.g. word processing documents or spreadsheets and the like. It should also be understood that while a content source may generally be understood as a well defined source of items for a data feed the content source may be more widely distributed or subjectively gathered by a user preparing a data feed . For example an individual user interested in automotive mechanics may regularly read a number of related magazines and regularly attend trade shows. This information may be processed on an ad hoc basis by the individual and placed into a data feed for review and use by others. Thus it will be understood that the data stream systems described herein may have broad commercial use as well as non commercial educational and mixed uses.

As described generally above the data feed may include for each item of content summary information such as a title synopsis or abstract or a teaser for more marketing oriented materials and a link to the underlying content. Thus as depicted in when a client accesses a data feed as depicted by an arrow the client may then display the summary information for each item in a user interface. A client may in response to user input such as clicking on a title of an item in the user interface retrieve the underlying item from the content source as indicated by an arrow . In the bi directional communication depicted by the arrow the client may also identify the specific data feed through which the item was identified which may be useful for tracking distribution channels customer behavior affiliate referral fees and so forth. It should be appreciated that an RSS data feed may be presented to a client as an RSS file in XML format that the client locally converts to HTML for viewing through a Web browser or the data feed may be converted to HTML at a Web site that responds to HTTP requests from a client and responds with an HTML formatted data feed.

A related concept is the so called permalink that provides a permanent URL reference to a source document that may be provided from for example a dynamically generated Web site or a document repository served from a relational database behind a Web server. While there is no official standard for permalink syntax or usage they are widely used in conjunction with data feeds. Permalinks typically consist of a string of characters which represent the date and time of posting and some system dependent identifier which includes a base URL and often identifies the author subscriber or department which initially authored the item . If an item is changed renamed or moved its permalink remains unaltered. If an item is deleted altogether its permalink cannot be reused. Permalinks are exploited in a number of applications including link tracing and link track back in Weblogs and references to specific Weblog entries in RSS or Atom syndication streams. Permalinks are supported in most modern weblogging and content syndication software systems including Movable Type LiveJournal and Blogger.

RSS provides a standard format for the delivery of content through data feeds. This makes it relatively straightforward for a content provider to distribute content broadly and for an affiliate to receive and process content from multiple sources. It will be appreciated that other RSS compliant and or non RSS compliant feeds may be syndicated as that term is used herein and as is described in greater detail below. As noted above the actual content may not be distributed directly only the headlines which means that users will ultimately access the content source if they re interested in a story. It is also possible to distribute the item of content directly through RSS though this approach may compromise some of the advantages of network efficiency items are not copied and distributed in their entirety and referral tracking. Traffic to a Web site that hosts a content source can increase in response to distribution of data feeds .

Although not depicted a single content source may also have multiple data feeds . These may be organized topically or according to target clients . Thus the same content may have data feeds for electronic mailing lists PDAs cell phones and set top boxes. For example a content provider may decide to offer headlines in a PDA friendly format or it may create a weekly email newsletter describing what s new on a Web site.

Data feeds in a standard format provide for significant flexibility in how content is organized and distributed. An aggregator for example may be provided that periodically updates data from a plurality of data feeds . In general an aggregator may make many data feeds available as a single source. As a significant advantage this intermediate point in the content distribution chain may also be used to customize feeds and presentation thereof as well as to filter items within feeds and provide any other administrative services to assist with syndication distribution and review of content.

As will be described in greater detail below the aggregator may filter prioritize or otherwise process the aggregated data feeds. A single processed data feed may then be provided to a client as depicted by an arrow . The client may request periodic updates from the data feed created by the aggregator as also indicated by an arrow . As indicated by an arrow the client may also configure the aggregator such as by adding data streams removing data streams searching for new data streams explicitly filtering or prioritizing items from the data streams or designating personal preferences or profile data that the aggregator may apply to generate the aggregated data feed . When an item of interest is presented in the user interface of the client a user may select a link to the item causing the client to retrieve the item from the associated content source as indicated by an arrow . The aggregator may present the data feed as a static web page that is updated only upon an explicit request from the client or the aggregator may push updates to a client using either HTTP or related Web browser technologies or by updates through some other channel such as e mail updates. It will also be appreciated that while the aggregator is illustrated as separate from the client the aggregator may be realized as a primarily client side technology where software executing on the client assumes responsibility for directly accessing a number of data feeds and aggregating filtering results from those feeds .

It will be appreciated that a user search for feeds will be improved by the availability of well organized databases. While a number of Weblogs provide local search functionality and a number of aggregator services provide lists of available data feeds there remains a need for a consumer level searchable database of feed content. As such one aspect of the system described herein is a database of data feeds that is searchable by contents as well as metadata such as title and description. In a server used with the systems described herein the entire universe of known data feeds may be hashed or otherwise organized into searchable form in real time or near real time. The hash index may include each word or other symbol and any data necessary to locate it in a stream and in a post.

The advent of commonly available data feeds such as RSS feeds along with tools such as aggregators enables new modes of communication. In one common use a user may through a client post aggregated feeds to a Weblog. The information posted on a Weblog may include an aggregated feed one or more data feeds that are sources for the aggregated feed and any personal political technical or editorial comments that are significant to the author. As such all participants in an RSS network may become authors or sources of content as well as consumers.

At present the consumer to consumer market model consists primarily of millions of individual bloggers mostly communicating with each other. This includes non commercial Weblogs where individuals aggregate data feeds from a variety of sources and include editorial commentary or other information. In general a source in this space is an individual presenting aggregated feeds in a Web site with some common theme or themes of interest to the author such as history sports science technology politics literature art music and so forth. However there are no strict requirements that any one or more themes be followed and the Weblog may simply reflect an ad hoc selection of topics that the author finds interesting. Weblogs in this space gain popularity according to the content provided with readership and associated RSS subscriptions or registrations rising or falling according to general interest.

The consumer to business model or segment brings together consumers who are interested in a particular topic typically a topic with a corresponding commercial market such as automobiles mortgages financial services home repair hobbies and the like. A topic may be still more refined such as antique automobiles or antique American automobiles however the corresponding participation of commercial participants may depend on the scope of the market. Thus a large number of financial service providers could be expected to subscribe to an RSS data feed for general consumers of financial services however a smaller number of commercial subscribers might be expected for derivative currency hedge instruments among Pacific Rim country currencies. In general consumer to business uses may provide consumers with concerns interests and preferences in a particular market with a forum that will be followed by corresponding commercial interests. In addition by participating in this RSS network businesses may also address consumer interests in a more direct and personal way as distinguished from the business to consumer segment discussed below. At the same time it will be appreciated that the distinction between these segments need not be an absolute one and a synthesis of these two communication channels may result in a greater dialogue between commercial and individual actors to their collective and mutual benefit. Thus for example with a suitably configured aggregated feed and associated Web presentation an automobile manufacturer could design a new minivan or SUV in cooperation with the automobile buying public in a manner that addresses previously unknown purchasing preferences of consumers. Additionally since the community of participants is likely to be highly focused this segment may offer significant opportunities for revenue from targeted advertising.

The business to business segment does not appear to be commonly used although in the methods and systems described herein syndication may substitute for electronic mail and other forms of corporate and business to business communication such as time management inventory supply chain manufacturing and customer relations information flow.

The business to consumer segment includes an extension of traditional media companies that can add data feed capabilities to their online presence. This includes news companies in print media radio television media and Internet media including by way of example and not limitation the New York Times the Washington Post the Wall Street Journal Forbes time Business Week CSPAN ESPN the Weather Channel CNBC CNET Bloomberg Reuters and so on. This may also include non news related media that nonetheless periodically update content such as movie studios network television cable television and so on. In addition other companies that serve consumers may also usefully employ data feed systems including companies ranging from catalogue companies such as Land s End to consumer electronics retailers such as Best Buy. In this context a syndication platform such as enhanced RSS offers a reliable distribution channel for advertising new products and special offers to presumably interested consumers. These and other applications may be realized using the data feed technology described herein.

All such entity to entity communications described above may be improved through enhanced syndication systems as generally described herein. It will be appreciated that one obstacle to expanded use across all of these markets is the absence in the primary technology RSS of enterprise class features such as security authentication conditional access data repositories and rich metadata to name a few. In one aspect the systems described herein bring many of these features to RSS like systems to provide secure scalable syndication systems.

It should be clear that while the term aggregator is used to label aspects of the systems disclosed herein those systems include significant useful and advantageous functionality that is not present in any aggregator in the prior art and as such the term should be interpreted broadly to optionally include all of the functions and techniques described below rather than narrowly in the sense that it is currently used in the art. Although broader in meaning the aggregator and interface described below may operate for example from one of the servers described above with reference to and may cooperate with other participants and content sources in the manner depicted for the aggregator described in .

It will be appreciated that the components described herein correspond generally to various areas of functionality for a data feed system. However in various embodiments other components may be added or certain components may be removed or combined with other components. For example the aggregator described herein may cooperate with an n tier architecture for a more general purpose Web server or with a relational database or other back end systems not specifically depicted herein to store and access data. Similarly the systems described herein may include FTP servers e mail servers PSTN interfaces and other physical connections and protocols for various other functions that may be usefully combined with the aggregator to enhance functionality. Any number of such combinations and variations may be employed consistent with the systems described herein and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

It will also be appreciated that a wide range of software and hardware platforms may be used to deploy the systems described herein. Generally the system components may be realized in hardware software or some combination of these. The components may be realized in one or more microprocessors microcontrollers embedded microcontrollers programmable digital signal processors or other programmable devices along with internal and or external memory such as read only memory programmable read only memory electronically erasable programmable read only memory random access memory dynamic random access memory double data rate random access memory Rambus direct random access memory flash memory or any other volatile or non volatile memory for storing program instructions program data and program output or other intermediate or final results. The components may also or instead include one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs dedicated semiconductor devices programmable gate arrays programmable array logic devices or any other device that may be configured to process electronic signals.

Any combination of the above circuits and components whether packaged discretely as a chip as a chip set or as a die may be suitably adapted to use with the systems described herein. It will further be appreciated that the above components may be realized as computer executable code created using a structured programming language such as C an object oriented programming language such as C or any other high level or low level programming language that may be compiled or interpreted to run on one of the above devices as well as heterogeneous combinations of processors processor architectures or combinations of different hardware and software.

Thus in general numerous architectures and variations are possible for deploying the functions and operations described herein and all such arrangements are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure. In one aspect the methods and systems disclosed herein may be understood as the functions and combinations thereof independent of how they are deployed. In another aspect the methods and systems disclosed herein may be understood as deployment specific or technology specific implementations of these features into specific products or services. All such variations are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure.

At the same time it should be understood that within the protocol stack as depicted in the number arrangement and functions of the layers may be varied in a number of ways within a syndication system in particular depending on the characteristics of the sources the needs of the users and the features desired for particular applications a number of improved configurations for syndication systems may be established representing favorable combinations and sub combinations of layers depicted in . The layers may provide services such as services related to applications other services including relating to processing services related to data services related to semantics of content syndication services and services related to infrastructure . More generally all of the services and functions described below either individually or in combinations as well as other services not specifically mentioned may be incorporated into an enhanced syndication system as described herein. It should be understood that any of the services depicted in the layers of may be embodied in hardware software firmware or a combination thereof for example a service may be embodied in software as a web service according to a services oriented architecture. Alternatively without limitation a service may be a client side or server side application or take any of the forms described herein and in the documents incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment one or more layers may be embodied in a dedicated semiconductor device such as an ASIC that is configured to enable syndication.

Services related to applications may be embodied for example in a client side application including commercially available applications such as a word processor spreadsheet presentation software database system task management system supply chain management system inventory management system human resources management system user interface system operating system graphics system computer game electronic mail system calendar system media player and the like a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack a web service a service oriented architecture service a Java applet or a combination of these. Applications may include for example a user interface social networking vertical market applications media viewers transaction processing alerts event action pairs analysis and so forth. Applications may also accommodate vertical market uses of other aspects of the system by integrating various aspects of for example security interfaces databases syndication and the like. Examples of vertical markets include financial services health care electronic commerce communications advertising sales marketing supply chain management retail accounting professional services and so forth. In one aspect the applications may include social networking tools to support functions such as sharing and pooling of syndicated content content filters content sources content commentary and the like as well as formation of groups affiliations and the like. Social networking tools may support dynamic creation of communities and moderation of dialogues within communities while providing individual participants with any desired level of anonymity. Social networking tools may also or instead evaluate popularity of feeds or items in a syndication network or permit user annotation evaluation or categorization. A user interface from the application may also complement other services layers. For example an application may provide a user interface that interprets semantic content to determine one or more display characteristics for associated items of syndicated content.

Other services may include any other services not specifically identified herein that may be usefully employed within an enhanced syndication system. For example content from the sources may be formatted for display through a formatting service that interprets various types of data and determines an arrangement and format suitable for display. This may also include services that are specifically identified which may be modified enhanced or adapted to different uses through the other services . Other services may support one or more value added services. For example a security service may provide for secure communications among users or from users to sources. An identity service may provide verification of user or source identities such as by reference to a trusted third party. An authentication service may receive user credentials and control access to various sources or other services within the system. A financial transaction service may execute financial transactions among users or between users and sources . Any service amenable to computer implementation may be deployed as one or more other services either alone or in combination with services from other elements of the system .

Data services may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Data services may include for example search query view extract or any other database functions. Data services may also or instead include data quality functions such as data cleansing deduplication and the like. Data services may also or instead include transformation functions for transforming data between data repositories or among presentation formats. Thus for example data may be transformed from entries in a relational database or items within an OPML outline into a presentation format such as MS Word MS Excel or MS PowerPoint. Similarly data may be transformed from a source such as an OPML outline into a structured database. Data services may also or instead include syndication specific functions such as searching of data feeds or items within data feeds or filtering items for relevance from within selected feeds or clustering groups of searches and or filters for republication as an aggregated and or filtered content source . In one aspect a data service as described herein provides a repository of historical data feeds which may be combined with other services for user configurable publication of aggregated filtered and or annotated feeds. More generally data services may include any functions associated with data including storing manipulating retrieving transforming verifying authenticating formatting reformatting tagging linking hyperlinking reporting viewing and so forth. A search engine deployed within the data services may permit searching of data feeds or with a content database as described herein searching or filtering of content within data feeds from sources . Data services may be adapted for use with databases such as commercially available databases from Oracle Microsoft IBM and or open source databases such as MySQL AB or PostgreSQL.

In one aspect data services may include services for searching and displaying collections of OPML or other XML based documents. This may include a collection of user interface tools for finding building viewing exploring and traversing a knowledge structure inherent or embedded in a collection of interrelated or cross linked documents. Such a system has particular utility for example in creating a structured knowledge directory of OPML structures derived from an exploration of relationships among individual outlined OPML documents and the nodes thereof such as end nodes that do not link to further content . In one embodiment the navigation and building of knowledge structures may advantageously be initiated from any point within a knowledge structure such as an arbitrarily selected OPML document within a tree. A user interface including the tools described generally above may allow a user to restrict a search to specific content types such as RSS podcasts which may be recognized e.g. by presence of RSS with an MP3 or WAV attachment or other OPML links within the corpus of OPML files searched. The interface may be supported by a searchable database of OPML content which may in turn be fed by one or more OPML spiders that seek to continually update content either generally or within a specific domain i.e. an enterprise a top level domain name a computer or any other domain that can be defined for operation of a spider. The OPML generated by an OPML search engine may also be searchable permitting e.g. recovery of lost links to OPML content.

It will be appreciated that by storing an entire knowledge structure or entire portions thereof the tree structure may be navigated in either direction. That is a tree may be navigated downward in a hierarchy which is possible with conventional outlines as well as upward in a hierarchy which is not supported directly by OPML . Upward navigation becomes possible with reference to a stored version of the knowledge structure and the navigation system may include techniques for resolving upward references e.g. where two different OPML documents refer to the same object using explicit user selections pre programmed preferences or other selection criteria as well as combinations thereof.

Data services may include access to a database management system DBMS . In one aspect the DBMS may provide management of syndicated content. In another aspect the DBMS may support a virtual database of distributed data. The DBMS may allow a user such as a human or an automatic computer program to perform operations on a data feed references to the data feed metadata associated with the data feed and the like. Thus in one aspect a DBMS is provided for syndicated content. Operations on the data managed by the DBMS may be expressed in accordance with a query language such as SQL XQuery or any other database query language. In some embodiments the query language may be employed to describe operations on a data feed on an aggregate of data feeds or on a distributed set of data feeds. It should be appreciated that the data feeds may be structured according to RSS OPML or any other syndicated data format. In another aspect content such as OPML content may describe a relationship among distributed data and the data services may provide a virtual DBMS interface to the distributed data. Thus there is disclosed herein an OPML based database wherein data relationships are encoded in OPML and data are stored as content distributed among resources referenced by the OPML.

The data services may include database transactions. Each database transaction may include an atomic set of reads and or writes to the database. The transaction mechanism for the database transactions may support concurrent and or conditional access to the data in the database. Conditional access may support privacy security data integrity and the like within the database. The transaction mechanism may allow a plurality of users to concurrently read write create delete perform a query or perform any other operation supported by the DMBS against an RSS feed or OPML file either of which may be supported by the data in the database or support a database infrastructure. In one aspect the transaction mechanism may avoid or resolve conflicting operations and maintain the consistency of the database. The transaction mechanism may be adapted to support availability scalability mobility serializability and or convergence of a DBMS. The transaction mechanism may also or instead support version control or revision control. The DBMS may additionally or alternatively provide methods and systems for providing access control record locking conflict resolution avoidance of list updates avoidance of system delusion avoidance of scaleup pitfall and the like.

The data services may provide an interface to a DBMS that functions as a content source by publishing or transmitting a data feed to a client. The DBMS may additionally or alternatively perform as a client by accessing or receiving a data feed from a content source. The DBMS may perform as an aggregator of feeds. The DBMS may provide a syndication service. The DBMS may perform as an element in a service oriented architecture. The DBMS may accept and or provide data that are formatted according to XML OPML HTML RSS or any other markup language.

In one aspect the data services may partition content into instructions and data. For example an expression as described more generally below may describe or define an interrelationship of various data referenced through one or more OPML files. The expression which may itself be an OPML file may be stored in a separate location from data which may be for example RSS feeds available at end nodes of an OPML structure. The expression may also or instead be expressed within a URL along with a call to a resource or stored in a different format. In another embodiment the data may itself be separated into OPML descriptions of relationships and end node data. In one aspect improved security or redundancy may be realized through separation of an OPML based relationship description which provides meaning or coherence to data from the underlying data which in the absence of the OPML becomes unstructured data.

Semantics or semantic processing may include any functions or services associated with the meaning of content from the sources and may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Semantics may include for example interrelating content into a knowledge structure using for example OPML adding metadata or enriching current metadata interpreting or translating content and so forth. Semantics may also include parsing content either linguistically for substantive or grammatical analysis or programmatically for generation of executable events. Semantics may include labeling data feeds and items within feeds either automatically or manually. This may also include interpretation of labels or other metadata and automated metadata enrichment. Semantics may also provide a semantic hierarchy for categorizing content according to user specified constraints or against a fixed dictionary or knowledge structure. Generally any function relating to the categorization interpretation or labeling of content may be performed within a semantic layer which may be used for example by users to interpret content or by sources to self identify content. Categorization may be based on one or more factors such as popularity explicit user categorization interpretation or analysis of textual graphical or other content relationship to other items such as through an outline or other hierarchical description content type e.g. file type content metadata e.g. author source distribution channel time of publication etc. and so forth. Currently available tools for semantic processing include OPML dictionaries thesauruses and metadata tagging. Current tools also include an array of linguistic analysis tools which may be deployed as a semantic service or used by a semantic service. These and other tools may be employed to evaluate semantic content of an item including the body and metadata thereof and to add or modify semantic information accordingly.

It will be understood that while OPML is one specific outlining grammar any similar grammar whether XML based ASCII based or the like may be employed provided it offers a manner for explicitly identifying hierarchies and or relationships among items within a document and or among documents. Where the grammar is XML based it is referred to herein as an outlining markup language.

Semantics may be deployed for example as a semantic service associated with a syndication platform or service. The semantic service may be for example a web service a service in a services oriented architecture a layer of a protocol stack a client side or server side application or any of the other technologies described herein as well as various combinations of these. The semantic service may offer a variety of forms of automated semi automated or manual semantic analysis of items of syndicated content including feeds or channels that provide such items. The semantic service may operate in one or more ways with syndicated content. In one aspect the semantic service may operate on metadata within the syndicated content as generally noted above. The semantic service may also or instead store metadata independent from the syndicated content such as in a database which may be publicly accessible or privately used by a value added semantic service provider or the like. The semantic service may also or instead specify relationships among items of syndicated content using an outlining service such as OPML. In general an outlining service outlining markup language outlining syntax or the like provides a structured grammar for specifying relationships such as hierarchical relationships among items of content. The relationship may for example be a tree or other hierarchical structure that may be self defined by a number of discrete relationships among individual items within the tree. Any number of such outlines may be provided in an outline based semantic service.

By way of an example of use of a semantic service a plurality of items of syndicated content such as news items relating to a corporate entity may be aggregated for presentation as a data feed. Other content such as stored data items may be associated with the data feed using an outline markup language so that an outline provided by the semantic service includes current events relating to a corporate entity along with timely data from a suitable data source such as stock quotes bond prices or any other financial instrument data e.g. privately held securities stock options futures contracts and also publicly available data such as SEC filings including quarterly reports annual reports or other event reports. All of these data sources may be collected for a company using an outline that structures the aggregated data and provides pointers to a current source of data where the data might change such as stock quotes or SEC filings . Thus an outline may provide a fixed structured and current view of the corporate entity where data from different sources changes with widely varying frequencies. Of course other content such as message boards discussion groups and the like may be incorporated into the outline along with relatively stable content such as a web site URL for the entity.

Syndication may include any functions or services associated with a publish subscribe environment and may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Syndication may include syndication specific functions such as publication subscription aggregation republication and more generally management of syndication information e.g. source date author and the like . One commonly employed syndication system is RSS although it will be appreciated from the remaining disclosure that a wide array of enhanced syndication services may provided in cooperation with or separate from an RSS infrastructure.

Infrastructure may include any low level functions associated with enhanced syndication services and may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Infrastructure may support for example security authentication traffic management logging pinging communications reporting time and date services and the like.

In one embodiment the infrastructure may include a communications interface adapted for wireless delivery of RSS content. RSS content is typically developed for viewing by a conventional full sized computer screen however users increasingly view web content including RSS feeds using wireless devices such as cellular phones Personal Digital Assistants PDAs wireless electronic mail devices such as Blackberrys and the like. In many cases content that is suitable for a normal computer screen is not appropriate for a small screen for example the amount of text that can be read on the screen is reduced. Accordingly embodiments of the invention include formatting RSS feeds for wireless devices. In particular embodiments of the invention include methods and systems for providing content to a user including taking a feed of RSS content determining a user interface format for a wireless device and reformatting the RSS content for the user interface for the wireless device. In embodiments the content may be dynamically reformatted based on the type of wireless device.

In embodiments tags from an RSS feed can be used to feed a template such as an XML enabled template that further modifies the RSS feed based on the nature of a wireless device. For example the abstract of an RSS feed can be delivered in a shortened format such as identifying and delivering the first sentence of the abstract. An RSS feed can also be broken up into sub segments and a user can be provided with a link within the feed for requesting additional sub segments or additional portions of the feed thus permitting a user to control content delivery where for example the user has a bandwidth constrained or display constrained device. In embodiments the link may be interactive and may be activated or manipulated by a user with a control such as a button thumbpad touchscreen dial button or stylus.

In embodiments an RSS feed may further comprise inserting a phone number into the feed wherein interacting with the phone number on a cellular phone or other telecommunications capable device initiates a telephone call. The telephone call could be to a content source so as to allow a user to hear a voice rendition of the content of the RSS feed to hear related content such as programming related to the RSS feed to initiate a transaction such as related to the content of the RSS feed to request a particular type of additional information to allow the user to subscribe to the feed or the like.

In embodiments the RSS feed may include a time related component such as a schedule for the delivery of additional content. In embodiments the time related component may be fed to a calendar task list or related facility thus setting an appointment related to the time related component in a user s electronic calendar such as on a handheld device or on a conventional personal computer or laptop computer.

In embodiments an RSS feed may be provided with a separate layer of security that is associated with a security facility of a wireless device. For example an RSS feed may be encrypted so that it may only be read by a specific type of wireless device a specific wireless device or on a specific wireless device only after entry of a password that is issued to a known user of that wireless device. In embodiments security may be associated with a location facility of the wireless device such as GPS cellular triangulation or the like so as to allow a user to access an RSS feed only if the user is physically located in a particular place. For example a user attending a live concert or other event might be permitted to view an RSS feed about the concert but other users might be excluded from that content creating a secure new media channel for event attendees.

In embodiments a user interface for a wireless or handheld device may be customized to include menus that specifically relate to RSS content. For example an interface may be provided with a separate RSS menu icon drop down selection or the like for allowing a user to place such a device in an RSS mode. Within an RSS mode initiated by an RSS menu option a user may be provided with options to take actions related to RSS such as subscribing to feeds selecting feeds from a set of feeds prioritizing feeds selecting feeds as favorites or the like. In embodiments an RSS mode may include a menu item for each of or a subset of the components of the RSS schema. For example a menu icon drop down item or the like may allow a user to select and view the title of an RSS feed the abstract text the authors or other content. In embodiments the user interface of a wireless or handheld device may have an RSS search icon menu or screen that returns RSS results in response to entry of a keyword. In embodiments results may be returned that include commercial and non commercial result sets which may be distinguished on the screen such as by screen location by an icon that identifies them as such or by another indicator of the distinction such as color font underlining italics boldface type highlighting or the like.

In another aspect the infrastructure may include improved pinging systems. The only current form of network service in an RSS environment is a primitive system of pings such as those provided by weblogs.com that permit users to track changes and updates to content. When a producer updates its RSS output file a message is sent to a central file server. When consumers want to know if there are updated RSS outputs from particular sources they go to the central file and see if there is a recent message from the producer of choice rather than retrieving the RSS source directly. When new content is available the consumer may send an electronic request directly to the producer s output file and read the contents into the consumers local files archive or repository. The infrastructure for an enhanced syndication system may provide improved pinging systems. For example a central server may be secure. In such a system each request for a ping may carry an encryption based key for the requestor. Responses to that requester which may be verified for example with reference to a trusted third party or using some other technique may be time bound with constraints on start times stop times frequency quotas or the like. In another embodiment the requestor may simply use a unique identification number. Pings may be subscription based so that a for fee pinger may be used more frequently than a free pinger. Thus there is disclosed herein a secure pinger for use in an RSS system. Also disclosed herein is a managed pinger which may limit ping responses according to subscription levels frequency or any other suitable criteria.

The infrastructure may more generally provide traffic management services including but not limited to real time monitoring of message latency traffic and congestion and packet quality across a network of end to end RSS exchanges and relationships. This may include real time monitoring of special traffic problems such as denial of service attacks or overload of network capabilities. Another service may be Quality of Service management that provides a publisher with the ability to manage time of sending of signaling messages for pingers time of availability of the signaled about messages and unique identifiers which apply to the signaling message and the signaled about message or messages. This may also include quality of service attributes for the signaled about message or messages and criteria for selecting end user computers that are to be treated to particular levels of end to end quality of service. This may be for example a commercial service in which users pay for higher levels of QoS.

It will be generally appreciated that the arrangement of layers and interfaces may vary however in one embodiment syndication may communicate directly with sources while the applications may communicate directly with users . Thus in one aspect the systems described herein enable enhanced syndication systems by providing a consistent framework for consumption and republication of content by users . In general existing technologies such as RSS provide adequate syndication services but additional elements of a syndication system such as social networking and semantic content management have been provided only incrementally and only on an ad hoc basis from specific service providers. The functions and services described above may be realized through for example the services oriented architecture described below with reference to and or any of the markup languages described below with reference to .

In one example a model of an end to end content syndication system for e.g. RSS OPML or other content may include the following elements convert structure store spider pool search filter cluster route and run. Conversion may transform data bi directionally between application specific or database specific formats and the syndication or outlining format. Structure may be derived from the content such as a knowledge structure inherent in interrelated OPML outlines or metadata contained in RSS tags. Storage may occur locally on a user device or at a remote repository. Spiders may be employed to search repositories and local data on user devices to the extent that it is made publicly available or actively published. Pools of data may be formed at central repositories or archives. Searches may be conducted across one or more pools of data. Filters may be employed to select specific data feeds items within a data feed or elements of an OPML tree structure. Specific items or OPML tree branches may be clustered based upon explicit search criteria inferences from metadata or content or community rankings or commentary. Routing may permit combinations among content from various content sources using e.g. web services or superservices. Such combinations may be run to generate corresponding displays of results. Other similar or different combinations of elements from the broad categories above may be devised according to various value chains or other conceptual models of syndication services.

More generally well defined interfaces between a collection of discrete modules for an established value chain may permit independent development improvement adaptation and or customization of modules by end users or commercial entities. This may include configurations of features within a module which might be usefully shared with others for example as well as functional changes to underlying software.

For example an author may wish to use any one or more of a number of environments to create content for syndication. By providing a module with a standardized interface to RSS posting converters may be created for that module to convert between application formats and an RSS ready format. This may free contributors to create content in any desired format and with suitable converters readily transform the content into RSS ready material. Thus disparate applications such as Microsoft Word Excel and Outlook may be used to generate content with the author leveraging off features of those applications such as spell checking grammar checking calculation capabilities scheduling capabilities and so on . The content may then be converted into RSS material and published to an RSS feed. As a significant advantage users may work in an environment in which they are comfortable and simply obtain needed converters to supply content to the RSS network. As a result contributors may be able to more efficiently produce source material of higher quality. Tagging tools may also be incorporated into this module or some author module to provide any degree of automation and standardization desired by an author for categorization of content.

As another example appropriate characterization of RSS material remains a constantly growing problem. However if tagging occurs at a known and predictable point in the RSS chain e.g. within a specific module then any number of useful applications may be constructed within or in communication with that module to assist with tagging. For example all untagged RSS posts may be extracted from feeds and pooled at a commonly accessible location where one or more people may resolve tagging issues. Or the module may automatically resolve tagging recommendations contributed by readers of the item. Different rules may be constructed for different streams of data according to editorial demands or community preferences. In short maintaining a separate tagging module or fixing the tagging function at a particular module within the chain permits a wide array of tagging functions which may be coordinated with other aspects of the RSS chain.

In another aspect a well defined organization of modules permits improved synchronization or coordination of different elements of the modules in the RSS chain. Thus for example centralized aggregators may be provided to improve usability or to improve the tagging of content with metadata where a combination of lack of standards and constantly evolving topics has frustrated attempts to normalize tagging vocabulary. By explicitly separating tagging from content visibility of tagging behavior may be improved and yield better tag selection by content authors. Similarly search techniques mapping and exploration may be fully separated from indexing pre processing to permit independent improvements in each.

A well established backplane or other communications system for cooperating RSS modules or other data feeds may enable a number of business processes or enterprise applications particularly if coupled with identity security role management which may be incorporated into the backplane or various modules connected thereto to control access to data feeds.

For example a document management system may be provided using an enhanced RSS system. Large companies particularly document intensive companies such as professional services firms including accounting firms law firms consulting firms and financial services firms employ sophisticated document management systems that provide unique identifiers and metadata for each new document created by employees. Each new document may also for example be added to an RSS feed. This may occur at any identifiable point during the document s life such as when first stored when mailed when printed or at any other time. By viewing the RSS feed with for example topical filters an individual may filter the stream of new documents for items of interest. Thus for example a partner at a law firm may remain continuously updated on all external correspondence relating to SEC Regulation FD compliance with Sarbanes Oxley or any other matter of interest. Alternatively a partner may wish to see all documents relating to a certain client. Similarly a manager at a brokerage house may wish to monitor all trades of more than a certain number of shares for a certain stock. Or an accountant may wish to see all internal memoranda relating to revisions to depreciation allowances in the federal tax code. An enhanced RSS system may provide any number of different perspectives on newly created content within an organization.

Other enterprise wide applications may be created. For example a hospital may place all prescriptions written by physicians at the hospital into an RSS feed. This data may be viewed and analyzed to obtain a chronological view of treatment.

In one aspect functions within the conceptual framework may include a group of atomic functions which may be accessed with a corresponding syntax. Arrangements of such calls into higher level more complex operations may also be expressed in a file such as an OPML file an XML file or any other suitable grammar. Effectively these groups of instructions may form programmatic expressions which may be stored for publication re use and combination with other programmatic expressions. Data for these programmatic expressions may be separately stored in another physical location in a separate partition at a location of the instructions or together with the instructions. In one aspect OPML may provide a grammar for expression of functional relationships and RSS may provide a grammar for data. Thus the same complex operation may be re executed against different data sets or against data in a syndicated feed that periodically updates. Thus in one aspect an architecture is provided for microprocessor styled programming across distributed data and instructions.

In general the service requester which may be any of the clients described above discovers services and receives service descriptions through an exchange with the service broker using a suitable syntax such as the Web Services Description Language WSDL . The service provider publishes service descriptions to the service broker also using a syntax such as WSDL. The service requester uses a service through communications with the service provider using a transport protocol such as Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP . An SOA may include any number of requesters brokers and providers . Additionally a number of protocols and standards may be employed to orchestrate the deployment of services in an SOA . In a web services embodiment the Web service protocol stack is employed to define locate implement and interact with Web services. In general this includes four main areas service transport XML messaging service description and service discovery. Service transport transports messages among network applications using protocols such as HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP File Transfer Protocol FTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP and more recently the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol BEEP . XML messaging encodes messages in a common XML format using for example XML RPC SOAP and REST. The service description is used to describe the public interface for services typically using WSDL as noted above. Service discovery may use WSDL along with Universal Description Discovery and Integration UDDI which provides a platform independent XML based registry for public Internet listings.

An SOA architecture may be used for example in an enhanced syndication system to relate metadata in an item of content to services that are available from the registry. Thus for example a publicly available registry may provide among other things a number of viewers for graphical images. An RSS item may refer to an image source such as an MRI image in a medical record from a hospital and may specify a viewer for the source image that is available through the registry. In operation a client with appropriate permission to view the image also as managed e.g. through the metadata for the enhanced syndication system may retrieve the appropriate viewer service from the registry and apply the viewer to view the source image. In this example viewers may be freely provided or may be licensed and made available through the registry on a fee per use basis or some other licensing terms. Similarly the image source may be made available in various resolutions each available under a different fee structure. In other embodiments textual sources may be available in various forms ranging from a title and biographical data to an abstract to the full text of the source. Thus the SOA platform may be used to resell content from an RSS archive using viewer or access privilege services made available through the registry. Other aspects such as identity and affiliation as well as verification of these may be made available as services in the SOA .

Services which may be for example any of the services described above with reference to may employ a variety of standards protocols and programming languages to interact meaningfully with the data . This includes for example the use of programming tools that permit program logic to be deployed in e.g. Java Windows Perl PHP C C and so on. This also includes parsing processing and database access using e.g. data binding mapping XML components into native formats of various programming languages Document Object Model DOM a programming interface for manipulation of XML HTML as program objects Simple API for XML SAX another API for XML documents XSL a stylesheet expression language XSL Transformations XSLT a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents XML Path Language XPATH a language for referring to parts of XML documents XSL Formatting Objects XSL FO an XML vocabulary for formatting semantics and a variety of tools for queries and other access to commercial databases. Further presentation may be provided using e.g. XHTML CSS XSL FO SMIL WSUI and a host of other presentation tools. Services may also employ various other XML oriented tools for messaging metadata and web services including SOAP XML RPC RDF UDDI WSDL and the like. Other specifications such as the Voice eXtensible Markup Language VoiceXML Security Services Markup Language S2ML and OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language SAML provide special purpose grammars for specific functions. In general these tools in various combinations permit a relatively arbitrary deployment of functions as services on top of content structured using XML grammars.

The services may interact with data through one or more established grammars such as a secure markup language a finance markup language WSDL the Outline Programming Markup Language OPML or other markup languages based upon XML which is a species of the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML . The interaction may be also or instead through non XML grammars such as HTML which is a species of SGML or other formats . More generally a wide array of XML schemas have been devised for industry specific and application specific environments. For example XML.org lists the following vertical industries with registered XML schemas including the number of registered schemas in parentheses all of which may be usefully combined with the systems described herein and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety Accounting 14 Advertising 6 Aerospace 20 Agriculture 3 Arts Entertainment 24 Astronomy 14 Automotive 14 Banking 10 Biology 9 Business Reporting 2 Business Services 3 Catalogs 9 Chemistry 4 Computer 9 Construction 8 Consulting 20 Customer Relation 8 Customs 2 Databases 11 E Commerce 60 EDI 18 ERP 4 Economics 2 Education 51 Energy Utilities 35 Environmental 1 Financial Service 53 Food Services 3 Geography 5 Healthcare 25 Human Resources 23 Industrial Control 5 Insurance 6 Internet Web 35 Legal 10 Literature 14 Manufacturing 8 Marketing PR 1 Math Data Mining 10 Multimedia 26 News 12 Other Industry 12 Professional Service 6 Public Service 5 Publishing Print 28 Real Estate 16 Religion Retail 6 Robotics AI 5 Science 64 Security 4 Social Sciences 4 Software 129 Supply Chain 23 telecommunications 26 translation 7 transportation 10 travel 4 Waste Management Weather 6 Wholesale and XML Technologies 238 .

Syndication services described in more detail below may operate in an XML environment through a syndication markup language which may support syndication specific functions through a corresponding data structure. One example of a currently used syndication markup language is RSS. However it will be appreciated that a syndication markup language SML as described herein may include any structure suitable for syndication including RSS RSS with extensions RSS RSS without certain elements RSS RSS with variations to elements RSS or various combinations of these e.g. RSS RSS . Furthermore an SML may incorporate features from other markup languages such as a financial markup language and or a secure markup language or may be used in cooperation with these other markup languages . More generally various combinations of XML schemas may be employed to provide syndication with enhanced services as described herein in an XML environment. It will be noted from the position of SML in the XML environment that SML may be XML based SGML based or employ some other grammar for services related to syndication. All such variations to the syndication markup language as may be usefully employed with the systems described herein are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure and may be used in a syndication system as that term is used herein.

According to the foregoing there is disclosed herein an enhanced syndication system. In one aspect the enhanced syndication system permits semantic manipulation of syndicated content. In another aspect the enhanced syndication system offers a social networking interface which permits various user interactions without a need to directly access underlying syndication technologies and the details thereof. In another aspect a wide variety of additional services may be deployed in combination with syndicated content to enable new uses of syndicated content. In another aspect persistence may be provided to transient syndicated content by the provision of a database or archive of data feeds and particularly the content of data feeds which may be searched filtered or otherwise investigated and manipulated in a syndication network. Such a use of a syndication system with a persistent archive of data feeds and items therein is now described in greater detail.

The syndication markup language or the syndication markup language in combination with other supporting markup languages and other grammars including but not limited to RSS OPML XML and or any other definition grammar syntax or format either fixed or extensible all as described in more detail below may support syndication related communications and functions. Syndication communications may generally occur through an internetwork between a subscriber and a publisher with various searching filtering sorting archiving modifying and or outlining of information as described herein.

Two widely known message definitions for syndicated communications are RSS 2.0 RSS and the Atom Syndication Format Draft Version 9 Atom as submitted to the IETF on Jun. 7 2005 in the form of an Internet Draft . A syndication message definition as used herein will be understood to include these definitions as well as variations modifications extensions simplifications and the like as described generally herein. Thus a syndication message definition will be understood to include the various XML specifications and other grammars described herein and may support corresponding functions and capabilities that may or may not include the conventional publish subscribe operations of syndication. A syndication definition may be described in terms of XML or any other suitable standardized or proprietary format. XML for example is a widely accepted standard of the Internet community that may conveniently offer a human readable and machine readable format. Alternatively the syndication definition may be described according to another syntax and or formal grammar.

For purposes of establishing a general vocabulary and not by way of limitation components of syndicated communications are now described in greater detail.

A message instance or message may conform to a message definition which may be an abstract typed definition. The abstract typed definition may be expressed for example in terms of an XML schema which may without limitation comprise XML s built in Document Type Definition DTD XML Schema RELAX NG and so forth. In some cases information may lend itself to representation as a set of message instances which may be atomic and may be ordered and or may naturally occur as a series. It should be appreciated that the information may change over time and that any change in the information may naturally be associated with a change in a particular message instance and or a change in the set of message instances. A data feed or data stream may include a set of messages. In an RSS environment a message instance may be referred to as an entry. In an OPML environment the message instance may be referred to as a list. More generally a message may include any elements of the syndication message definition noted above. Thus it will be appreciated that the terms list outline message item and the like may be used interchangeably in the description of enhanced syndication systems herein. All such meanings are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure unless a more specific meaning is expressly indicated or clear from the context. A channel definition may provide metadata associated with a data feed and a subscription request may include a URI or other metadata identifying a data feed and or data feed location. The location may without limitation comprise a network address indication of a network protocol path virtual path filename and any other suitable identifying information.

A syndication message definition may include any or all of the elements of the following standards and drafts all of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference RSS 2.0 Atom Syndication Format as presented in the IETF Internet Draft Version 9 of the Atom Syndication Format OPML 1.0 XML Signature Syntax as published in the W3C Recommendation of 12 Feb. 2002 the XML Encryption Syntax as published in the W3C Recommendation of 10 Dec. 2002 and the Common Markup for Micropayment per fee links as published in the W3C Working Draft of 25 Aug. 1999 . In summary these elements which are described in detail in the above documents may include the following channel title link description language copyright managing editor managingEditor Web master webmaster publication date pubDate last build date lastBuildDate category generator documentation URL docs cloud time to live ttl image rating text input textInput skip hours skipHours skip days skipDays item author comments enclosure globally unique identifier guid source name URI email feed entry content contributor generator icon id logo published rights source subtitle updated opml head date created dateCreated date modified dateModified owner name ownerName owner e mail ownerEmail expansion state expansionState vertical scroll state vertScrollState window top windowTop window left windowLeft window bottom windowBottom window right windowRight head body outline signature Signature signature value SignatureValue signed information Signedinfo canonicalization method CanonicalizationMethod signature method SignatureMethod reference Reference transforms Transforms digest method DigestMethod digest value DigestValue key information KeyInfo key value KeyValue DSA key value DSAKeyvalue RSA key value RSAKeyValue retrieval method RetrievalMethod X509 data X509Data PGP Data PGPData SPKI Data SPKIData management data MgmtData object Object manifest Manifest signature properties SignatureProperties encrypted type EncryptedType encryption method EncryptionMethod cipher data CipherData cipher reference CipherReference encrypted data EncryptedData encrypted key EncryptedKey reference list ReferenceList encryption properties EncryptionProperties price text link textlink image link imagelink request URL request URL payment system paymentsystem buyer identification buyerid base URL baseurl long description longdesc merchant name merchantname duration expiration target base language hreflang type access key accesskey character set charset external metadata ExtData and external data parameter ExtDataParm .

A syndication definition may also include elements pertaining to medical devices crawlers digital rights management change logs route traces permanent links also known as permalinks time video devices social networking vertical markets downstream processing and other operations associated with Internet based syndication. The additional elements may without limitation comprise the following clinical note ClinicalNote biochemistry result BiochemistryResult DICOM compliant MRI image DCMRI keywords Keywords license License change log ChangeLog route trace RouteTrace permalink Permalink time Time shopping cart ShoppingCart video Video device Device friend Friend market Market downstream processing directive DPDirective set of associated files FileSet revision history RevisionHistory revision Revision branch Branch merge Merge trunk Trunk and symbolic revision SymbolicRevision . Generally in embodiments the names of the elements may be case insensitive.

For example the contents of the clinical note element may without limitation comprise a note written by a clinician such as a referral letter from a primary care physician to a specialist. The contents of the biochemistry result element may without limitation comprise indicia of total cholesterol LDL cholesterol HDL cholesterol and or triglycerides. The contents of the DICOM compliant MRI image element may without limitation comprise an image file in the DICOM format. The content of the keyword element may without limitation comprise a word and or phrase associated with the content contained in the message wherein the word and or phrase may be processed by a Web crawler. The content of the license element may without limitation comprise a URL that may refer to a Web page containing a description of a license under which the message is available. The content of the change log element may without limitation comprise a change log. The content of the route trace element may without limitation comprise a list of the computers through which the message has passed such as a list of received headers analogous to those commonly appended to an e mail message as it travels from sender to receiver through one or more SMTP servers. The content of the permalink element may without limitation comprise a permalink such as an unchanging URL. The content of the time element may without limitation comprise a time which may be represented according to RFC 868. The content of the shopping cart element may without limitation comprise a representation of a shopping cart such as XML data that may comprise elements representative of quantity item item description weight and unit price. The content of the video element may without limitation comprise a MPEG 4 encoded video file. The content of the device element may without limitation comprise a name of a computing facility. The content of the friend element may without limitation comprise a name of a friend associated with an author of an entry. The content of the market element may without limitation comprise a name of a market. The content of the downstream processing directive element may without limitation comprise a textual string representative of a processing step such as and without limitation Archive This that ought to be carried out by a recipient of a message.

Thus in general a syndication definition as that term is used herein describes a message format that enables Internet syndication operations as well as other complementary or separate operations. A message as that term is used herein may be associated with a feature of RSS may be associated with a feature of Atom may be associated with a feature of OPML may be associated with a micropayment may be associated with electronic commerce may be associated with a representation of medical information may be associated with the representation of public information may be associated with the representation of private information may be associated with the representation of protected information may be associated with a tag for a crawler may be associated with versioning and or a change log may be associated with a digital signature may be associated with basic authentication may be associated with digest authentication may associated with encryption may be associated with a license term may be associated with a route trace may be associated with a permalink may be associated with an enclosure or file attachment may be associated with an indication of time or a timestamp may be associated with e commerce may be associated with searching may be associated with filtering may be associated with clustering may be associated with a database may be associated with security may be associated with video may be associated with a device may be associated with a user interface may be associated with a rule may be associated with non syndication technologies may be associated with social networking may be associated with a vertical market may be associated with downstream processing may be associated with semantic processing and or may be associated with a source.

A message as described herein may include consist of or be evaluated by one or more rules or expressions referred to collectively in the following discussion as expressions that provide descriptions of how a message should be processed. In this context the message may contain data in addition to expressions or may refer to an external source for data. The expression may be asserted in a variety of syntaxes and may be executable and or interpretable by a machine. For example an expression may have a form such as that associated with the Lisp programming language. Although an expression may commonly be represented as what may be understood as a Lisp like expression or Lisp list for example a b c this particular representation is not necessary. An expression may defined recursively and may include flow control branching conditional statements loops and any other aspects of structured object oriented aspect oriented or other programming languages. For example and without limitation it should be appreciated that information encoded as SGML or any species thereof such as and without limitation XML HTML OPML RSS and so forth may easily be represented as a Lisp like expression and vice versa. Likewise data atoms such as and without limitation a text string a URL a URI a filename and or a pathname may naturally be represented as a Lisp like expression and vice versa. Again by way of illustration and not limitation any representation of encoded information that can be reduced to a Lisp like expression may be an expression as that term is used herein.

An expression may without limitation express the following a data atom a data structure an algorithm a style sheet a specification an entry a list an outline a channel definition a channel an Internet feed a message metadata a URI a URL a subscription a subscription request a network address an indication of a network protocol a path a virtual path a filename a syntax a syntax defining an S expression a set a relation a function a graph a tree a counting algorithm a probabilistic algorithm a randomized algorithm a geometric distribution a binomial distribution a heap a heapsort algorithm a priority queue a quicksort algorithm a counting sort algorithm a radix sort algorithm a bucket sort algorithm a median an order statistic a selection algorithm a stack a queue a linked list a pointer an object a rooted tree a hash table a direct address table a hash function an open addressing algorithm a binary search tree a binary search tree insertion algorithm a binary search tree deletion algorithm a randomly built binary search tree a red black tree a red black tree rotation algorithm a red black tree insertion algorithm a red black tree deletion algorithm a dynamic order statistic an interval tree a dynamic programming algorithm a matrix a matrix chain multiplication algorithm a longest common subsequence a polygon a polygon triangulation an optimal polygon triangulation an optional polygon triangulation algorithm a greedy algorithm a Huffman code a Huffman coding algorithm an amortized analysis algorithm an aggregate method algorithm an accounting method algorithm a potential method algorithm a dynamic table a b tree a b tree algorithm such as and without limitation search create split insert nonfull delete a binomial heap a binomial tree a binomial heap algorithm such as and without limitation create minimum link union insert extract minimum decrease key delete a Fibonacci heap a mergeable heap a mergeable heap algorithm such as and without limitation make heap insert minimum extract minimum and union a disjoint set a disjoint set algorithm a cyclic graph an acyclic graph a directed graph an undirected graph a sparse graph a breadth first search algorithm a depth first search algorithm a topological sort algorithm a minimum spanning tree a Kruskal algorithm a Prim algorithm a single source shortest path Dijkstra s algorithm a Bellman Ford algorithm an all pairs shortest path a matrix a matrix multiplication algorithm the Floyd Warshall algorithm Johnson s algorithm a flow network the Ford Fulkerson method a maximum bipartite matching algorithm a preflow push algorithm a lift to front algorithm a sorting network an arithmetic circuit an algorithm for a parallel computer a matrix operation a polynomial a fast Fourier transform a number theoretic algorithm a string matching algorithm a computational geometry algorithm an algorithm in complexity class P an algorithm in complexity class NP and or an approximation algorithm.

In one aspect a message processor as described herein may include a hardware and or software platform for evaluating messages according to any of the expressions described above. The message processor may reside for example on the server computer or client computer as described above. The processing may without limitation include the steps of read evaluate execute interpret apply store and or print. The machine for processing an expression may comprise software and or hardware. The machine may be designed to process a particular representation of an expression such as and without limitation SGML or any species thereof. Alternatively the machine may be a metacircular evaluator capable of processing any arbitrary representation of an S expression as specified in a representation of an expression.

Generally a message may include or be an expression. In other embodiments the expression evaluation process may itself be syndicated. In such an embodiment interpretations i.e. evaluations of a message may vary according to a particular evaluation expression even where the underlying message remains constant such as by filtering concatenating supplementing sorting or otherwise processing elements of the message or a plurality of messages. Different evaluation expressions may be made available as syndicated content using the syndication techniques described generally herein.

The message may specify presentation e.g. display parameters or include expressions or other elements characterizing a conversion into one or more presentation formats.

In embodiments the message may include an OPML file with an outline of content such as and without limitation a table of contents an index a subject and associated talking points wherein the talking points may or may not be bulleted an image a flowchart a spreadsheet a chart a diagram a figure or any combination thereof. A conversion facility which may include any of the clients or servers described above may receive the message and convert it to a specified presentation format which may include any proprietary or open format suitable for presentation. This may include without limitation a Microsoft PowerPoint file a Microsoft Word file a PDF file an HTML file a rich text file or any other file comprising both a representation of content and a representation of a presentation of the content. The representation of content may comprise a sequence of text an image a movie clip an audio clip or any other embodiment of content. The representation of the presentation of the content may include characteristics such as a font a font size a style an emphasis a de emphasis a page relative position a screen relative position an abstract position an orientation a scale a font color a background color a foreground color an indication of opacity a skin a style a look and feel or any other embodiment of presentation as well as combinations of any or all of the foregoing. In a corresponding method a message may be received and processed and a corresponding output file may be created that represents a presentation format of the received message. In various aspects the message may include an OPML file with references to external data. During processing this data may be located and additionally processed as necessary or desired for incorporation into the output file.

In one embodiment the system may include an OPML to PowerPoint converter that traverses one or more OPML outlines and converts the OPML outline into a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation having a structure representative of the structure embodied in the outline. This may include for example one or more introductory slides with title author creation date and other information. This may also include one or more slides summarizing the contents of the entire PowerPoint document based upon the top level contents of the outline in the OPML document. Sub categories may be similarly previewed in the PowerPoint document with slides that list all elements of an outline at one hierarchical level followed by a number of slides addressing each element in greater detail. Additionally items such as graphics charts tables audio clips word documents and the like that are contained on leaf nodes of the OPML outline may be rendered within the PowerPoint slides to capture some or all of the multi media content represented within the OPML outline. Similarly the system may convert a PowerPoint presentation into an OPML outline and may either employ the explicitly outlined structure of the PowerPoint presentation or infer structure from the arrangement or titles of slides within the PowerPoint document.

In one aspect the systems described herein may be used to scan historical feed data and locate relevant data feeds. For example filters may be applied to historical feed data to identify feeds of interest to a user. For example by searching for words such as optical and surgery in a universe of medical feeds a user may locate feeds relevant to optical laser surgery regardless of how those feeds are labeled or characterized by other users or content providers. In another complementary application numerous filters may be tested against known relevant feeds with a filter selected according to the results. This process may be iterative where a user may design a filter test it against relevant feeds apply to other feeds to locate new relevant feeds and repeat. Thus while real time or near real time filtering is one aspect of the systems described herein the filtering technology may be used with historical data to improve the yield of relevant material for virtually any topic of interest.

Another advantage of filtering historical data is the ability to capture transient discussions and topics that are not currently of interest. Thus a user interested in the 1996 U.S. Presidential campaign may find little relevant material on current data feeds but may find a high amount of relevant data in the time period immediately preceding the subsequent 2000 campaign. Similarly an arbitrary topic such as Egyptian history may have been widely discussed at some time in the past while receiving very little attention today. The application of filters to historical feeds may provide search functionality similar to structured searching of static Web content. Thus there is disclosed herein a time or chronology oriented search tool for searching the contents of one or more sequential data feeds.

In another aspect the filters may be applied to a wide array of feeds such as news sources to build a real time magazine dedicated to a particular topic. The results may be further parsed into categories by source. For example for diabetes related filters the results may be parsed into groups such as medical and research journals patient commentaries medical practitioner Weblogs and so forth. The resulting aggregated data feed may also be combined with a readers forum editor s overview highlights of current developments and so forth each of which may be an additional data feed for use for example in a Web based real time magazine or a new aggregated data feed.

In general the filter may apply any known rules for discriminating text or other media to identified data feeds. For example rules may be provided for determining the presence or absence of any word or groups of words. Wild card characters and word stems may also be used in filters. In addition if then rules or other logical collections of rules may be used. Proximity may be used in filters where the number of words between two related words is factored into the filtering process. Weighting may be applied so that certain words groups of words or filter rules are applied with different weight toward the ultimate determination of whether to filter a particular item. External references from an item e.g. links to other external content either the existence of links or the domain or other aspects thereof may be used to filter incoming items of a data feed. External links to a data feed or data item may also be used so as to determine relevance by looking at the number of users who have linked to an item. This process may be expanded to measure the relevance of each link by examining the number of additional links produced by the linking entity. In other words if someone links to a reference and that user has no other links this may be less relevant than someone who links to the reference and has one hundred other links. This type of linking analysis system is provided for example by Technorati.

Filters may apply semantic analysis to determine or approximate the tone content or other aspects of an item by analyzing words and word patterns therein. Filters may also examine the source of an item such as whether it is from a .com top level domain or a .edu top level domain. The significance of a source designation as either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of passing through the filter may of course depend on the type of filter. Additionally synonyms for search terms or criteria may be automatically generated and applied alongside user specified filter criteria.

Metadata may be used to measure relevance. Data feeds and data items may be tagged with either subject matter codes or descriptive words and phrases to indicate content. Tags may be provided by an external trusted authority such as an editorial board or provided by an author of each item or provider of each data feed. These and any other rules capable of expression through a user interface may be applied to items or posts in data feeds to locate content of interest to a particular user.

As noted above a user may also share data feeds aggregated data feeds and or filters with others. Thus in general there is provided herein a real time data mining method for use with data feeds such as RSS feeds. Through the intelligent filtering enabled by this data feed management system automatically updating information montages tailored to specific topics or users may be created that include any number of different perspectives from one to one hundred to one thousand or more. These real time montages may be adapted to any number of distinct customer segments of any size as well as to business vertical market applications.

In another aspect filters may provide a gating technology for subsequent action. For example when a number of items are identified meeting a particular filter criterion specific automated actions may be taken in response. For example filter results or some predetermined number of filter results may trigger a responsive action such as displaying an alert on a user s monitor posting the results on a Weblog e mailing the results to others tagging the results with certain metadata or signaling for user intervention to review the results and status. Thus for example when a filter produces four results an e mail containing the results may be transmitted to a user with embedded links to the source material.

It will be appreciated that search results will be improved by the availability of well organized databases. While a number of Weblogs provide local search functionality and a number of aggregator services provide lists of available data feeds there does not presently exist a consumer level searchable database of feed contents at least nothing equivalent to what Google or AltaVista provide for the Web. As such one aspect of the system described herein is a database of data feeds that is searchable by contents as well as metadata such as title and description. In a server used with the systems described herein the entire universe of known data feeds may be hashed or otherwise organized into searchable form in real time or near real time. The hash index may include each word or other symbol and any data necessary to locate it in a stream and in a post.

One useful parameter that may be included for searching is age. That is the age of a feed the age of posts within a feed and any other frequency data may be integrated into the database for use in structured user searches and the filters discussed in reference to .

As a further advantage data may be retrieved from other aggregators and data feeds on a well defined schedule. In addition to providing a very current view of data streams this approach prevents certain inconsistencies that occur with currently used aggregators. For example even for aggregator sites that push notification of updates to subscribers there may be inconsistencies between source data and data feed data if the source data is modified. While it is possible to renew notification when source material is updated this is not universally implemented in aggregators or Weblog software commonly employed by end users. Thus an aggregator may extract data from another aggregator that has not been updated. At the same time an aggregator or data source may prevent repeated access from the same location e.g. IP address . By accessing all of this data on a regular schedule that is acceptable to the respective data sources and aggregators and storing the results locally the server described herein may maintain a current and accurate view of data feeds. Additionally feeds may be automatically added by searching and monitoring in real time in a manner analogous to Web bots used by search engines for static content.

In another aspect a method of selling data feed services is disclosed herein. In this method RSS data which is actually static content in files may be serialized for distribution according to some time base or time standard such as one item every sixty seconds or every five minutes. In addition data may be filtered to select one item of highest priority at each transmission interval. In another configuration one update of all items may be pushed to subscribers every hour or on some other schedule in an effective batch mode. Optionally a protocol may be established between the server and clients that provides real time notification of new items. A revenue model may be constructed around the serialized data in which users pay increasing subscription rates for increasing timeliness with premium subscribers receiving nearly instantaneous updates. Thus in one aspect a data feed system is modified to provide time based data feeds to end users. This may be particularly useful for time sensitive information such as sports scores or stock prices. In another embodiment the end user feed may adhere to an RSS or other data feed standard but nonetheless use a tightly controlled feed schedule that is known to both the source and recipient of the data to create a virtual time based data feed.

Additional profile information such as user interests preferences and biographical data may also be optionally provided. This data and other user profile data may be used to target advertising associated with data feed sites or content. Thus a data feed management system is described herein in which ads are delivered that are of value to customers. In addition to self signaling through profile data the system may apply customer filtering behavioral analysis or any other analytic tools as applied to the user s feed selection and displayed posts to select appropriate advertisements for that user. The revenues from advertisements may be shared in a number of ways and may include shares of revenue to for example the operator of the data feed management system an intermediary that places an ad that results in a sale and or individual or institutional content providers who contributed to the relevant data feed audience.

In another aspect of the systems described herein feeds posts and or filters may be clustered and shared in a number of ways as described above. Particular configurations may be branded and sold as a value added service. Thus for example Warren Buffet s data feed selection and filtering may be of great interest to investors bankers and financiers. These selections may be sold to users who wish to see data feeds in the same manner as Warren Buffet. Similarly someone may be interested in the writings and readings of Martha Stewart Bill Clinton Bill O Reilly Bill Gates or Bill Belichick. Any of these individuals may brand and resell their selection of data feeds and design and use of filters. Similarly commercial political or other institutional entities may present an official RSS feed identity. This may be provided for free for promotional purposes such as promotion of a political party in a campaign or promotion of a seasonal sale event by a retailer. Similarly topical selections may be promoted by trade groups or individuals. For example a biotech or patent filter may be promoted by a patent law firm. In these applications the service sold or promoted may include either the filters and selections themselves which an end user may then modify or use as desired or an aggregated feed of results from the filters and selections without identification of the underlying criteria. Access to such an aggregated feed may be controlled through password based protection to a resulting Weblog or using the identity based RSS technology described above.

In one embodiment a user may either for a fee as described above or for free such as among a group of friends or interest based community of bloggers share not just search results but rules for finding those search results. In another application of this technology a buddy list or other community may share aggregator configurations and other data. In another application of this a recommendation engine may identify popular and successful search and filtering criteria that match a particular use profile.

In one aspect there is described herein a systematic approach to managing data feeds in an integrated and possibly Web based user interface. In a first step the user may process feeds including for example searching for analyzing and selecting feeds. In a second step a user may process posts within a feed such as by filtering the posts as described above. In a third step the aggregated and filtered results may be displayed to the user. This systematic approach also readily accommodates subsequent processing of the resulting items such as by branding the technique for locating those items or by permitting sharing of the technique both of which are described above. Additional processing steps may also include for example aggregating results into an aggregated feed or any of the other processing steps identified in the foregoing detailed description.

A number of enhanced syndication systems providing security are now described in greater detail. While a number of examples of RSS are provided as embodiments of a secure syndication system it will be appreciated that RDF Atom or any other syndication language or OPML or other structured grammar including more generally the S definition set out above may be advantageously employed within a secure syndication framework as set forth herein.

Security may impact a number of features of a syndication system. For example a data stream system may use identity assignment and or encryption and or identity authentication and or decryption by public and private encryption keys for RSS items and similar structured data sets and data streams. The system may include notification of delivery as well as interpretation of delivery success failure notification of possible compromise of the end to end security system non repudiation and so on. The identity assignment and encryption as well as the authentication and decryption as well as the notification and interpretation may occur at any or multiple points in the electronic communication process some of which are illustrated and described below. A secure RSS system may be advantageously employed in a number of areas including but not limited to general business health care and financial services. Encryption may be employed in a number of ways within an RSS system including encryption and or authentication of the primary message notification to a sender or third party of receipt of messages interpretation of delivery method and processing of an RSS item during delivery.

In item level encryption of the primary message an item from an RSS source or similar source may be assigned an identifier which may be secure such as a digital signature and or encrypted with a key such as a private key in a Public Key Infrastructure PKI and transmitted to a recipient who may use a corresponding public key associated with a particular source to authenticate or decrypt the communication. A public key may be sent to the recipient simultaneously or in advance by a third party or collected by the recipient from a third party source such as a public network location provided by the source or a trusted third party. In other embodiments an intended recipient may provide a public key to a sender so that the sender which may be a content source aggregator or other RSS participant may encrypt data in a manner that may only be decrypted by the intended recipient. In this type of exchange the intended recipient s public key may similarly be published to a public web location e mailed directly from the recipient or provided by a trusted third party.

In tag level encryption of fields of data delimited within a message similar encryption techniques may be employed. By using tag level encryption security may be controlled for specific elements of a message and may vary from field to field within a single message. Tag level encryption may be usefully employed for example within a medical records context. In a medical environment and in numerous other environments it may be appropriate to treat different components of e.g. a medical record in different ways. Thus while a medical record of an event may include information from numerous sources it may be useful to compose the medical record from various atomic data types each having unique security and other characteristics associated with its source. Thus the medical record may include treatment objects device objects radiology objects people objects billing objects insurance objects diagnosis objects and so forth. Each object may carry its own encryption keys and or security features so that the entire medical record may be composed and distributed without regard to security for individual elements.

In a notification system a secondary or meta return message may be triggered by receipt authentication and or decryption of the primary message by a recipient and sent by the recipient to the message originator or to a third party to provide reliable notification of receipt.

In interpretation of delivery information a sender or trusted intermediary may monitor the return message s and compare these with a list of expected return messages based for example on the list of previously or recently sent messages . This comparison information may be interpreted to provide information as to whether a communication was successful and in the case of communication to more than one recipient to determine how many and what percentage of communications were successful. The receipt of return messages that do not match the list of expected messages may be used to determine that fraudulent messages are being sent to recipients perhaps using a duplicate of an authentic private key and that the security service may have been compromised.

In another aspect a series of encryption keys may be used by the source and various aggregators or other intermediaries in order to track distribution of items through an RSS network. This tracking may either use notification and interpretation as described herein or may simply reside in the finally distributed item which will require a specific order of keys to properly decrypt some or all of the item. If this system is being used primarily for tracking rather than security encryption and decryption information may be embedded directly into the RSS item either in one of the current fields or in a new field for carrying distribution channel information e.g. . . . .

In another aspect the message may be processed at any point during distribution. For example the communication process may include many stages of processing from the initial generation of a message through its ultimate receipt. Any two or more stages may be engaged in identity assignment and or encryption as well as the authentication and or decryption as well as notification and or interpretation. These stages may include but are not limited to message generation software such as word processors or blog software message conversion software for producing an RSS version of a message and putting it into a file open to the Internet relay by a messaging service such as one that might host message generation and RSS conversion software for many producers relay by a proxy server or other caching server relay by a notification server whose major function is notifying potential recipients to pull a message from a source and services for message receiving and aggregating and filtering multiple messages message display to recipients and message forwarding to further recipients.

In another aspect a message may include one or more digital signatures which may be authenticated with reference to for example the message contents or a hash or other digest thereof in combination with a public key for the purported author. Conversely a recipient of a digitally signed item may verify authenticity with reference to the message contents or a hash or other digest version thereof in combination with a private key of the recipient.

In general the pools may be physically deployed on any data storage resource accessible through the network . This may include for example a database web server FTP file peer to peer file sharing resource secure database RSS channel or any other technology platform and system s suitable for receiving storing and transmitting data. It will be understood that in various embodiments each pool may be a logically and or physically separate storage location permitting either distributed management of common data e.g. for purposes of security redundancy or the like or centralization of distributed data e.g. for more efficient processing .

While a pool may be realized as for example a conventional RSS channel that receives and publishes items other pools may collect and present data in more complex ways. For example the pool management infrastructure may include a pool server or other system that either physically or logically sits between the user community and the pools and broker s interactions. The infrastructure may control access to the pools through a security system that includes for example any of the security features or systems described herein. In one embodiment the infrastructure may include a firewall router switch or similar device that physically resides between the pools and the user community . The pools may also or instead be partially or completely encrypted. The infrastructure may also provide attention management by tracking user interactions with various pools and or data within pools. In one aspect the infrastructure may provide anonymity either to users accessing the pools or to the pools or sources of data therein. In another aspect the infrastructure may provide formatting functions. As with anonymity formatting may operate in either direction i.e. by formatting user requests in a manner suitable for presentation to the pools or that creates a logical appearance of pools to differently structured underlying data sources or by formatting any responsive output from a pool. In one aspect the infrastructure may provide a dynamic content system that provides different views of pools according to a user type user identity or the like. In another aspect the infrastructure may provide search capabilities including structured searching and or spidering for content within the pools . It will be understood that while depicted as a single centralized server the pool management infrastructure may include any number of servers and or other network devices or systems that cooperate and or operate autonomously to create a data pool environment for users in a community .

The community may include any user or group of users that access data in pools either by providing data to the pools extracting data from the pools or both. This may include social groups professional groups commercial entities and so forth.

Using a pool management infrastructure sources of data may be treated as populations and managed as an integrated but evolving ecology or topology so that new forms of data can be added to the ecology continually so that sets of data in particular forms can be added to and or modified and so that uses of data and combinations of data can be continually invented and implemented within the ecology without reworking the existing structure and applications.

In one example the pool management infrastructure may enable secure management of a pool system and any associated data data formats and pool enclosures. The infrastructure may for example provide an administrative dashboard that includes an administrative interface to a secure access control system an administrative interface to a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system and an administrative interface to the update notification availability and spider system provided by vendor . The infrastructure may also or instead include an administrative interface for configuring the data converter and router systems to put data into pools controls for a spider to control extraction and search filter cluster and routing to pools and web services. It may also include interfaces for directing web services to take input directly from particular pools to take input from the spider and other routing machines and to output service results to particular pools and services in particular formats.

The pool data storage format may be XML RSS OPML Atom RDF or any other data format. Pool content may be managed using a file directory system maintained by an operating system such as Linux Unix Microsoft Windows. Pool content including enclosures to pool items may be provided by a client side central data store for XML RSS and related formats included in the Microsoft Vista operating system for personal computers.

Sources of data for pools may include any source s of digital data. For example in a medical context sources may include machines such as x ray MRE PET CT and other medical imaging devices as well as blood diagnostic inventory management ordering scheduling billing human output fed programs such as notes on medical record diagnostic forms and or process fed outputs such as the result of a cross functional medical second opinion process. In an enterprise suitable sources may include document management systems electronic mail systems instant messaging systems billing systems accounting systems human resources systems computer network traffic management systems and so forth.

These sources may also or instead output data to the data pools in a common format such as XML RSS OPML Atom RDF or any other common format. Data sources may also send their customary outputs through a format converter that outputs a common format and a data pool router that directs the output to an appropriate data pool or pools.

In one aspect data pools may be viewed as folders open to inspection or more formally reading and writing by a spider or other search mechanism. A spider may for example use remote web service calls to poll each pool or a pool interface provided by the pool management infrastructure to determine if a given pool is accessible or if it has had any changes to its contents and to read and write pool content. A spider may be deployed to monitor and manage a total topology of pools and any data contained therein.

Spiders may collect information from pools and enable the shared management of information across pools by allowing diverse information to be retrieved assembled and analyzed in order to for example create a virtual medical record by combining data elements that are held in different pools of diagnostic test results physician notes and the results of processes. Pools also may be accessed for quality control for example to review x ray s and diagnostic findings for a random sample of patients in order to ascertain the quality of diagnosis.

Pools may employ a variety of security measures to achieve conditional access privacy security and the like. Access to pools can be controlled for individuals e.g. according to identity or role spiders web services and so forth. Access control may be implemented for example using third party products such as Cisco Secure Access Server or Microsoft Products such as Windows Active Directory or the Windows Server Network Access Protection NAP policy enforcement platform built into the Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server operating systems. More generally LDAP Active Directory or other services protocols may be employed for management of passwords identities roles and the like.

CVE or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures analysis and remediation is a process through which network assets are analyzed to determine vulnerability to hacking data theft unauthorized access and the like. The US government in cooperation with The MITRE Corporation MITRE and computer software and hardware vendors monitors and inventories vulnerabilities and exposures. A number of companies provide software hardware and consulting services to identify and address these risks on a network such as an enterprise or corporate network. In an enterprise pool management system CVE may be applied to data pools and any supporting infrastructure. Pools using conditional access and security systems such as those that assure compliance with HIPPA health data protection standards may be assessed using CVE techniques. In addition to identifying common vulnerabilities and threats a security system may accommodate automated or semi automated interventions to secure data pools and infrastructure. In one embodiment CVE enabled security for pools may be provided with suitable adaptations to commercially available products and services such as the NetClarity Auditor Enterprise system.

In general syndicated data outlined data or more generally any structured or unstructured data may be stored in pools which provides a useful conceptual model for interaction with syndicated content and other data as well as a specific term to refer to data sources and or repositories that interact with the systems described herein. Aspects of the present invention relate to pooling syndicated information. Pools may contain information relating to information that was found in data streams. A pool may represent for example information from one or more data streams at particular times or from particular sources. For example a financial market may produce a stream of data relating to trades made during a trading session and a pool of data extracted from the stream may be created for subsequent use. As another example medical information may be produced by a medical device and the medical device information may be pushed into a data stream. The medical information from the data stream may be extracted from the stream and placed in a pool. As another example all information related to a particular topic person entity or the like may be acquired from a range of different data streams and placed into a corresponding pool.

Pools of data can be merged with other pools of data to form larger pools e.g. to combine things of like file type semantic meaning subject matter etc. . In embodiments pools may be drained and in doing so new data streams may be created. An example would be streaming a series of offers to sell goods or services securities etc. at a given price out of a pool of such offers. In embodiments the data stream may be buffered until relevant decision points are achieved.

In embodiments a filter may be associated with a pool of data. A pool of data may be created from unfiltered data e.g. an unfiltered data stream and then over time the pool can be run through filters to produce a cleaner more relevant pool of data. The filter could be a semantic filter a collaborative filter a logical filter or a human filter such as a community that validates the presence of content in the pool . E.g. a pool could contain good movies that are monitored by a community.

In embodiments pools may be linked to other pools so that one pool spills into the other e.g. a pool of data that takes input from another pool upon occurrence of an event such as availability of a resource for processing for example when a resource becomes available to process an incoming message requesting help from a software help desk and is handed into a pool of similar requests for handling by someone who is responsible for that type of request . Pools of data can evaporate that is data items can be made to expire from the pool either based on age or based on the right conditions e.g. if a price of a security drops low enough then limit orders may be triggered if time passes an option can expire etc. . Pools may be filled by different sources a main source as well as secondary sources or streams that augment the main source streams .

An aspect of the systems described herein relates to the filtering of contents such as syndicated feeds and the like. Syndication content filters may be used in connection with hardware software firmware in a chip set or in another configuration. In embodiments a user may publish or subscribe to a syndication feed on his desktop system or mobile communication facility e.g. PDA cellular phone and the like and the syndication feed may be filtered through a syndication filter. In embodiments the syndication filter is a mechanism adapted to define the syndication feed. For example a device may be set to collect certain feeds through a hardware enabled syndication filter.

The client may also or instead include a software based syndication filter . The software syndication filter may execute as a background process associated with network traffic or be integrated into an operating system or an application executing on the CPU and it may run from volatile or non volatile memory not shown associated with the client . The software syndication filter may provide for example the functions of the hardware syndication filter or syndication filter described above. The CPU may call a software syndication filter routine from the data repository in the process of monitoring a syndication feed. For example in the process of receiving a syndication feed the CPU may call the routine to monitor analyze manipulate or otherwise interact with the feed.

Filters may operate on various data types within syndicated messages. Syndicated data feeds e.g. RSS or syndicated OPML may contain device configuration settings images video data broadcast rating information and the like. Syndicated feeds may be available in or contain many different formats e.g. tables databases documents multimedia web content formats metadata electronic mail and so forth and they may contain information from a variety of sources such as electronic mail online content or web content. A feed may contain various types of information for signal type filters such as radio and TV broadcast content rating security information and the like. The feed or messages within a feed may include data for suitably enabled devices to change a mode of operation using different modes to suit different content client devices and so forth. In an organization users on different IP addresses may desire different information content from the same source a hardware device may have a syndication filter incorporated to automatically filter and or sort the syndicated data to the proper IP address es . Syndication applications may be capable of automatically performing an analysis on received feeds to filter IP URL addresses viruses attached files in email weblog feeds email instant messages web content phone calls TV channels or various analog and digital signals. A filter may apply different rules to different types of enclosures or attachments. Thus for example a filter may apply a first set of rules to MP3 attachments a second set of rules to OPML attachments a third set of rules to metadata and a fourth set of rules to textual content within a message.

In general a filter may operate to pass certain information and or block certain information. In a data feed environment filters may employ a variety of techniques to filter a feed. The filter may operate on various aspects of the feed. This may include for example textual content metadata attachments external references either from an item or to an item and so forth. A filter may employ rules algorithms look up tables keywords Boolean expressions heuristics and the like. A filter may operate on specific fields within an item such as source name date title and so forth. Numerous devices may incorporate syndication filtering as described generally above. A number of non limiting examples are provided below. Some of these examples show a device that implements filtering of syndicated content. Other examples show conventional filters that send or receive filter related data in a syndicated format. Various combinations and modifications of the examples and these general principles will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure.

Filtering may be embedded into a network router. Network routers may have syndication filter capability incorporated into the network router firmware or may have a syndication capable chip or chip set incorporated into at least one of the network router processors or circuit boards. The syndication capable network router may be able to recognize that a received file is a syndication data feed and may make routing decisions based on the syndication data feed contents. The syndication capable network router may be able to route data to IP addresses on a network based on the syndication data or information contained in the header and body of a network packet or by information in the syndication feed. The syndication feeds may originate from IP addresses within the router network or may be received from outside the router network such as from the internet. For example if a number of users received financial data from a common syndication source but the different users were interested in different parts of the financial data the syndication capable router may route portions of the syndicated data according to user criteria. Thus for example the router may handle data from a syndicated source of mortgage data by routing trading data for secondary mortgage markets to one user e.g. a bond fund manager current mortgage rates to a second user e.g. a consumer and mortgage qualification data to a third user e.g. a retail bank .

The syndication capable network router may be able to route syndication data feeds for at least one of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data.

Filtering may be embedded in a virus protection application. The virus protection application may incorporate syndication filtering capabilities. The syndication capable virus protection application may inspect attachments or enclosures to syndicated content or may analyze the syndicated content itself for malicious instructions or the like. The syndication capable virus protection application may be adapted to identify filter and or block viral syndication content and or attachments in one or more of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data electronic mail internet based online news newspapers web magazines academic papers government court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analyses discussions of current events internet media advertisements web pages weblogs and websites based on known syndication virus content.

A filter may be deployed as a syndication attachment or enclosure filter. This filter may be adapted to locate other syndicated content or sources of content. RSS data feeds for example may contain content or attachments that contain additional syndication data. A syndication attachment file filter may scan messages from a syndicated data feed for attachments that may contain other syndication data in which a user has interest. For example a medical data feed may have information that a user is interested in but may also contain an attachment with additional medical information. The syndication attachment file filter may be able to determine if the attachment contains information that may be of interest to the user and either keep or omit the attachment from the received data feed. The filter may filter syndication attachments using at least one of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data based on syndication content. The filter may filter attachments to other media types. For example the filter may scan electronic mail for syndication attachments and apply various filtering rules to any such attachments. As another example the filter may scan the content of a word processing document for references to syndication sources and or messages.

A filter may operate locally or remotely. For example a client device may filter a weblog or collection of weblogs or aggregator output to remove items that are not of interest. In another aspect a remote weblog reader may filter content and transmit the filter output to a client device. A weblog filter may filter feeds according to at least one of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data based on user defined syndication content. The weblog filter may filter feeds according to source using such as for example filters based on internet based online news newspapers web magazines academic papers government court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analyses discussions of current events internet media and advertisements.

Websites may broadcast syndication data files that may contain a brief description of the content of the website. A syndication web content filter may be able to read the syndication data file content to block access to a certain site based on any user defined feature. For example a parent wanting to block a certain type of websites from a child may be able to define the type of site to block. The parent may define key words phrases ratings and so forth to look for in the syndication data file. The filter may block web sites according to one or more of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data based on the user defined syndication web site rating. The syndication web content filter may be adapted to block web sites containing at least one of internet based online news newspapers web magazines academic papers government court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analyses discussions of current events internet media and advertisements based on the user defined syndication web site rating. The syndication web content filter may be able to block at least one of web pages weblogs websites and web browser content based on the user defined syndication web site rating.

A syndication phishing filter may be able to block syndication phishing requests based on the syndication content and definition by the user.

A search engine may incorporate a filter. An Internet search engine may contain a filter adapted to identify sites that provide syndication data feeds responsive to a user s definition. For example a user may be able to define a search for medical information on heart valves to get only a listing of syndication data feed sites with this information. The filter may employ any of the parameters or filtering techniques described above.

A security appliance may incorporate a filter. Security appliances operate as reverse proxy devices positioned between any type of client and a server to act as an additional layer of security for communications. A security appliance may perform checks for viruses spam phishing or other undesired files sent to a server. The server may be any kind of server such as an application server email server or web server. A syndication capable security appliance may be adapted to analyze syndication data feeds to determine the syndication data feed content and make decisions to block or pass the syndicated content onto the server. The filter may employ any of the parameters or filtering techniques described above. The syndication capable security appliance may be adapted to filter at least one of unwanted syndication network packet traffic syndication IP addresses and syndication MAC addresses from entering a server. The syndication capable security appliance may be adapted to filter at least one of unwanted syndication digital signatures syndication passwords or keys and syndication identity certificates from entering a server.

Database applications e.g. Oracle may incorporate syndication filter capabilities. Syndication data files may have the same structure as XML using tags to indicate the beginning and end of information sections of the information or data. XML and syndication are becoming increasingly popular for holding data because of their small size and data types they may contain. A syndication capable database application may be adapted to search and filter data from syndication data sources in addition to the same abilities for tables and databases. The syndication capable database application may be adapted to filter at least one of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data from syndication sources based on user or application requirements.

The encryption filter may employ any of the filtering parameters or techniques described above.

A filter may provide caller ID filtering. The filter may identify and extract caller information from a cellular phone wired telephone wireless telephone VoIP telephone or other telephonic device. Information may for example be published to a data feed or forwarded for other processing. In another aspect the filter may identify and extract telephone numbers and other contact information from a data feed. The caller ID filter may employ any of the filtering parameters or techniques described above.

A filter may provide content filtering. A channel blocking system may be provided for a device to manage access to broadcast e.g. radio or television or other transmissions. The transmission may be accompanied by content ratings or other semantic data that may be employed by the channel blocking system to restrict availability at a receiving device according to user preferences. In one aspect the ratings may be provided as a syndicated feed. In another aspect the transmissions may be processed to derive a feed of characteristic information which may in turn be applied by the channel blocking system to dynamically restrict access according to current content and any user provided constraints. The filter may be applied to one or more of a radio broadcast a television broadcast a satellite broadcast a satellite radio broadcast a cable television channel or the like.

Also described below are a number of Syndication enabled devices. While one embodiment of the inventions disclosed herein may use RSS it will be appreciated that other standardized formats may be used whether syndication formats such as RDF Atom and the like or outlining formats such as OPML. Thus it should be understood that the term RSS is used throughout this application as a convenient shorthand for a wide range of possible standardized XML grammars or other formats and does not in any way limit the scope of the inventions disclosed herein to RSS embodiments unless otherwise explicitly indicated or clear from the context. More generally in the following discussion the term syndication generally and references to RSS specifically should be understood to include for example RDF RSS v 0.90 0.91 0.9x 1.0 and 2.0 variously attributable to Netscape UserLand Software and other individuals and organizations as well as Atom from the AtomEnabled Alliance and any other similar formats as well as non conventional syndication formats that can be adapted for syndication such as OPML as well as attachments or enclosures which may have any native format. Still more generally while RSS technology is described and RSS terminology is used extensively throughout it will be appreciated that the various concepts discussed herein may be usefully employed in a variety other contexts. For example various privacy and identity techniques described herein may be usefully combined with HTML Web content rather than RSS based XML data. Similarly some of the branding and advertising techniques described herein may be usefully combined with list servers bulletin boards or other Internet news sources. Thus it will be understood that the embodiments described herein are provided by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventive concepts disclosed herein.

Referring to an embodiment of a semiconductor device is shown. Discrete logic may be the basic building block of integrated circuits of which the semiconductor device is comprised. The integrated circuits may comprise semiconductor AND and OR gates which may assembled to solve and or directed at solving expressions of Boolean logic. Thus the semiconductor gates may be referred to as Boolean gates.

A Boolean gate may have two inputs the AND gate passes a logical 1 if both inputs are a logical value of 1 whereas the Boolean OR gate passes a logical 1 if only one of the inputs is a logical value of 1. These gates may be combined and cascaded to create a logical function that may be used in semiconductor devices. Moreover these operation of these gates may be associated with triggered by coordinated in reference to and or driven by a periodic clock signal an asynchronous interrupt signal or any other signal.

Microcode sometimes called firmware may be the lowest level of semiconductor programming code. Microcode may be programmed directly into the semiconductor or else hard coded in order to control a function of the semiconductor. The microcode may not be edited after it is hard coded. On some RISC computers the microcode is not used by the microprocessor but may act directly on the computer controllers. On some mainframe computers the microcode may be modifiable in this case the microcode may be contained on an EEPROM where it may be reprogrammed.

An application specific integrated circuit ASIC is a semiconductor device dedicated to a specific function. ASICs may have over 100 million gates in its design and modern ASICs often include entire 32 bit processors and other large complex building blocks. A large scale ASIC may be called system on a chip SoC .

A programmable logic device PLD is a semiconductor device that is programmable to execute logic commands. The PLD may be a chip or chip set containing an array of logical AND and OR gates. A PLD may be hard coded in a manufacturing facility by blowing the fuses to program the AND and OR gates in order to perform a certain function and so that the PLD may be mass produced. The PLD function may be designed and coded in a software language and then converted into hardcode commands for the manufacturing process. PLDs are typically small in scale and may be used for such simple processing needs as address decoding within a computer or a network device. PLDs may be grouped together to form larger Complex Program Logic Devices CPLC and Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGA . These more complex logical devices may be used to perform larger scale processes such as processing data streams.

A programmable array logic PAL device is a semiconductor device that provides a fixed array of programmable cells such as a fixed set of OR gates and programmable AND planes. The PAL device may allow the reuse of functional outputs.

A reduced instruction set computing RISC microprocessor is a semiconductor device comprising a processor that contains a limited number of hard coded functions or instructions in relation to other microprocessors e.g. a personal computer . The RISC processor may contain a small simple instruction set to permit increased speed of the processor. Because of the reduced instruction set of the RISC processor the RISC processor may contain fewer transistors than a standard microprocessor and therefore may be less expensive to design and produce. The reduced processor instruction set is typically compensated for by more extensive software to expand instructions available to higher level processes.

A complex instruction set computing CISC processor is a semiconductor device comprising a processor that employs a relatively larger instruction set and may accommodate operational codes or instructions and or operands of varying length. A typical CISC processor produced by Intel or Motorola may have at least one hundred instructions in the instruction set. The instruction set may be called by software applications to perform various functions on data voice or audio.

A field programmable gate array FPGA is a semiconductor device that uses gate array technology to provide functions. A gate array may include a predetermined number of logical gates positioned on a silicon wafer and then connected with metal interconnections to create a program function. The advantage of a FPGA is that it may be programmed for a particular purpose after the manufacture of the wafer which permits high volume manufacturing without loss of functional generality. The processing speeds of FPGA processors may be slower than dedicated devices such as a PLD.

A microprocessor which may include a CISC processor or RISC processor may be a semiconductor device that includes logic for executing instructions along with caches or other on chip memory to store instructions results and the like. Microprocessors are often characterized by the type of instruction set instruction size and clock speed. For example a microprocessor may be characterized as a 32 bit RISC microprocessor running at 500 MHz.

A microcontroller may be ASIC containing enough components to be considered a controller the controller may consist of inputs outputs and memory. The microcontroller may be a programmable microcontroller or a dedicated microcontroller. An embedded microcontroller may be referred to as an embedded microcontroller where the microcontroller is incorporated into a larger scale semiconductor device. In general microcontrollers may include adequate memory and input outputs for standalone operation whereas a microprocessor would typically require external RAM and other chipsets for incorporation into a computing device.

A programmable digital signal processor DSP is in general a semiconductor device optimized for processing of digital signals. DSPs may be employed in digital audio video and communications systems e.g. for compression decompression or the like as well as digital to analog or analog to digital conversion systems.

The semiconductor device may include any of the devices described above and may be packaged as a chip chipset system on a chip or the like. A chip set may be embodied on a single piece of semiconductor wafer on multiple pieces of semiconductor wafer in a single package or on multiple pieces of semiconductor wafer contained in more than one package each of which may provide one or more electrical contact points or pins that provide electrical coupling to leads on a circuit board that may be designed to accept and associate together each of the packages in the chip set via electrical circuits.

The semiconductor device may be adapted to receive a data feed and transmit the collected information to a computer a server a hard disk a CD a DVD a Flash memory or a web capable device. The semiconductor device may also or instead be adapted to process syndicated content such as by aggregating a plurality of feeds filtering or otherwise processing feed content encrypting or decrypting syndicated content formatting syndicated content for display or more generally providing any of the services or functions associated with the conceptual syndication framework described above with reference to e.g. . The semiconductor device may also or instead be adapted to publish a data feed in a suitable syndication format which may be a data feed processed as generally described above. The semiconductor device may be a web capable device adapted to interact with the Web by receiving and transmitting information using e.g. HTTP or other web based protocols. The information received and transmitted by the semiconductor device may be RSS OPML or any other outlining syndication or data streaming formats or technologies described herein whether based upon XML or upon some other syntax or protocol all of which are periodically referred to herein as RSS for purposes of convenience only and not by way of limitation.

The semiconductor device may be incorporated into a device such as and without limitation any of the devices described below and may provide syndication or enhanced syndication services to from or through the device. For example the semiconductor device as a chip component chip or chipset may be incorporated into a washing machine to provide syndication services. The syndication enabled washing machine may transmit a data feed related to for example the amount of water used by a washing machine during a period of time.

The enhanced video stream in some embodiments may comprise or be embodied as the video stream . From the perspective of the user a presentation of the enhanced video stream may appear to be analogous to that provided by a traditional over the air television broadcast. The enhanced video stream may be provided in association with features that may be analogous to those of a digital video recorder such as record rewind fast forward and other such features. Additionally or alternatively interactive features may be provided. These interactive features may allow the user to affect the content of the enhanced video stream such as an without limitation by selecting what a character in a movie should say next by selecting and or interacting with an on screen commercial by selecting from a plurality of alternate endings for a movie by selecting a racing car from which a NASCAR race should be displayed by selecting a physical or virtual camera from which a sporting event should be displayed by selecting a sequence of physical exercises to be displayed in an exercise video stream to provide feedback to the publisher provider actor director producer and or sponsor of content in the video stream and so forth. The particular Feed Video that appears in the enhanced video feed may be manually selected by a human or may be automatically selected by a computer process. In either case the selected video may be chosen according to a criterion that may be associated with the user of the enhanced video stream a characteristic of the user of the enhanced video stream and or the nature or topic of the enhanced video stream .

In some embodiments the enhanced video stream may allow the user to view television like programming such as a video presentation of a sporting event or concert events in real time. Many examples of television like programming will be apparent. The presentation of the enhanced video stream may enable viewing of a live concert or sporting event without the user having to buy a ticket to or to travel to a venue at which concert or event may occur. Alternatively the enhanced video stream may be associated with the ticket or the venue and may be enabled for viewing only if the user has purchased the ticket or has traveled to the venue.

In embodiments the enhanced video stream may also provide a forum or virtual classroom for an otherwise non interactive classroom collegiate experience directed at students of online colleges or Universities. The forum or virtual classroom may avail the students of the opportunity to have a live instructor available to them by providing an access control such as a password that may enable only registered students to access the enhanced video stream which may comprise a live classroom video accessible by the use of a passcode by enabling learners who rely distinctly on visual and verbal clues who learn by observation and engagement and not by text learning in isolation by offering interactive features such as a asking the instructor questions or being able to engage in meaningful dialogue by offering a more traditional learning experience for a non traditional learner who may be disabled or ill and unable to attend a brick and mortar school by availing an instructor the opportunity to reach a wider audience of students by teaching via the enhanced video stream resulting in a studentless classroom in the traditional sense but by reaching students at a plurality of locations in real time.

In other embodiments the invention may provide the enhanced video stream directed at capturing and storing important life events. These life events may include a sport game a birthday party a holiday party a vacation and the like. The enhanced video stream may comprise video that may be captured with a video capture device such as and without limitation a camcorder a phone a video chat device and the like. The enhanced video stream may be tagged perhaps facilitating a later identification and or organization of one or more instances of the video stream . These tags with which the enhanced video stream may be tagged may be words and or concepts that somehow reflect the content of the video stream and or may facilitate an organization of video storage or review. A user and or automatic computer system may identify perhaps based upon the tag a particular instance of the enhanced video stream within a library or archive of such streams . In one embodiment this identification may be performed using a search engine. Alternatively or additionally the tagging may enabling the enhanced video stream to identify itself to the user and or an automatic computer program.

Referring to in embodiments the invention may provide to an enhanced video stream that may comprise a surveillance video of which the video content may be comprised directed at security and home family and business surveillance systems. This video may be associated with and or captured in response to a signal generated by a sensor such as and without limitation a motion sensor a heat sensor a light sensor a sound sensor a smoke sensor and the like. A plurality of instances of the sensor may be installed in multiple places throughout a residence or other building and may generate the signal at least in part by a measurement or change of an environmental condition in the residence or other building. The environmental condition may without limitation comprise a movement a temperature fluctuation a change in illumination a sound such as may be associated with an unauthorized entrance through glass or doorways smoke carbon monoxide and the like. A video camera which may be a syndication enabled device may capture the video in response to the signal . Alternatively or additionally the video may be captured continuously periodically from time to time or not in response to the signal . In any case the video camera may generate the enhanced video stream .

In one embodiment a plurality of instances of the video camera may be placed at multiple points throughout the building so that the cameras may provide a viewing option to the user of the system. The cameras may be camouflaged may be fixed in place may be portable and or may be mounted on a robotic device able to travel to multiple points in the building. Each of the cameras may provide video an instance of the feed which may comprise the enhanced video stream . These instances of the feed may be aggregated by the video aggregator the aggregator or any other system providing one or more feeds to one or more users wherein the one or more provided feeds may comprise the surveillance video and the users may without limitation comprise an owner of the building under surveillance a fire station an insurance company a police station a homeowner and so forth.

Likewise a robotic device comprising the video camera may provide a live enhanced video stream which may responsive personnel such as and without limitation firefighters or law enforcement personnel to scan a building from the outside. This scan may enable a full moveable view of a premises with internal safety risks or criminal occurrence without compromising the safety of the responsive personnel. Alternatively or additionally the video camera may be embedded in a safety uniform or headgear worn by the responsive personnel. In embodiments the surveillance video provided by the video camera may be aggregated as described hereinabove with reference to . In any case the surveillance video or any replica or representation thereof may be password protected with viewing enabled and or reserved for particular users only.

In another embodiment the surveillance video may be directed at of non emergent home surveillance. In this embodiment usage of the invention may be preventative and may provide remote users the ability to monitor an elderly relative teenage children or ill family member. Monitoring may include the use of fixed cameras in various points throughout the residence so that the user may gain viewable access to a household member pet and so forth.

The database query language allows a user such as and without limitation a human or an automatic computer program to interactively interrogate the database view the contents of the database update the contents of the database update the logical structure or organization of the database create logical or materialized views of the contents in the database and so forth. The database query language may be SQL XQuery or any other database query language. In general the functionality of the database query language may be employed to describe database like operations across an OPML based content pool that is a collection of distributed content that is interrelated using OPML or any similar language or syntax for defining hierarchies and relationships among documents RSS feeds and or other objects.

The schema definition language may define a schema of a database hosted in the DBMS . The schema definition language may without limitation be the Universal Modeling Language UML XML Schema or any other language suitable for the definition of a database schema. Alternatively and commonly the schema definition language may be implicit in the database query language such as is the case with SQL.

In a conventional data system the data structures may be the particular logical and or physical arrangement of the data in the database wherein such arrangement may be particularly suited for rapid disposal onto and or rapid retrieval from a secondary storage medium such as a platter in a hard disk drive. In an OPML based content pool the data structures may be outline defined knowledge structures that exist independent of content while pointing to linking to or otherwise identifying content within the pool and relationships among same.

The transaction mechanism may provide for concurrent access to the data in the database. In an OPML based content pool the transaction mechanism may similarly provide for shared and or conditional access to items of content. In one aspect this may be deployed as a conditional access to content for purposes of privacy security or data integrity. In another aspect this may be deployed as a technique for permitting individual users to both read and write to content items or create new items while preventing conflicts or inconsistencies. In transaction processing technologies generally one aim of the transaction mechanism is to provide Atomicity Consistency Isolation and Durability know in the art as the ACID properties. The ACID properties are described in ISO IEC 10026 1 1992 Section 4 included herein by reference. For a number of reasons many of which are well known in the art implementing the ACID properties is not trivial. This is particularly true in systems that aim to provide high transaction throughput involving concurrent reads from and writes to the database. This is also particularly true in systems such as a distributed content pool that comprise network environments in which network connections may fail in which data delivery may be subject to intermittent lag and or loss due to contention for network resources in which data transmission between remote sites may be necessarily delayed due to the a physical limit such as the speed of light in which sites are only intermittently connected to the network environment in which the network environment may contain partitions and so forth.

In some applications comprising the DBMS the ACID properties may be desirable but not strictly necessary. For example without limitation in a contact management system a plurality of users may contribute contact information pertaining to a plurality of people and or businesses which may consistent of an array of independent contact lists or a centralized contact database. This contact information may be stored in a database and may comprise phone numbers URLs names addresses and so forth. If one of the plurality of users were to contribute a new piece of contact information it may be acceptable for that new information to be temporarily unavailable to the other users of the contact management system. A common situation in which this occurs is the business traveler who during a cross country flight may take the time to enter new contact information into a copy of Microsoft Outlook running on his laptop computer. The copy of Microsoft Outlook may be part of a contact management system that comprises multiple copies of Microsoft Outlook running on multiple laptop computers all of which are synchronized through an instance of Microsoft Exchange Server running on a server machine in a central office. Each copy of Microsoft Outlook may maintain a replica of the database. The purpose of the synchronization may be to return the database replicas to a state in which they are identical thus making the same contact information available to all of the laptop computers. It is unreasonable to expect that the business traveler will have access to a data network during flight so that his laptop computer may be connected to the Exchange Server. It is equally unreasonable for the contact management system to force the business traveler to wait until he has access to such a data network before entering the new contact information into his laptop. Thus his copy of Microsoft Outlook may store in a data store local to his laptop computer the new contact information. Later when the laptop computer is connected to the data network his copy of Microsoft Outlook may upload this new contact information to the Exchange Server and may download from the Exchange Server any updates or additions to the contact information that may be been entered by other users on other laptops. In this common situation the ACID properties are clearly violated In some embodiments a laptop computer may be a client in the network . Thus an individual s contacts may be maintained as a feed that is published for use within e.g. an enterprise. The individual may post a new contact to the feed locally with updates provided as the feed to clients and or servers of the network . The same principle may be employed where multiple users can post to the same feed . In any case the multitude of laptop computers clients and or servers will at least temporarily and from time to time have an inconsistent view of the contacts managed by the contact management system. Nevertheless this type of contact management system may be preferable to one that attempts to enforce the ACID properties which would at the very least require that the laptop computers be connected to a data network at the time that updates and additions are applied by the business traveler.

It should be appreciated that numerous systems of human communication and commerce rely on methods that violate the ACID properties. The system of writing checks is one. Here the ledger balance maintained by a check writer may not always be synchronized with the account balance maintained by a bank. The system of sending electronic mail is another. Here a sender of e mail will often have a copy of his e mail in his sent folder before a recipient has a copy of the e mail in his inbox. The system of transmitting and receiving blog pings via a ping aggregator is still another. Here a sender of a ping will often have updated information associated with the ping available in a blog before a subscriber to an aggregator s ping feed has received the ping. Many other examples should be apparent.

Referring now to a syndicated database management system S DBMS may include a syndicated transaction mechanism a syndicated analytical mechanism a syndicated schema definition language the data structures and the database query language . An OPML based content pool may provide similar functionality with suitable adaptations. In other embodiments a conventional database system may be configured to provide efficient access to syndicated content.

The syndicated schema definition language may define a schema of a database managed by the S DBMS . This language may enable the specification of a hierarchical data model a network data model a relational data model or any other data model. The database managed by the S DBMS may comprise the data feeds and associated permalinks. The language may comprise the syndication markup language . The S DBMS may support more one or more languages . For example the S DBMS may support RSS OPML and another markup language . For another example the S DBMS may support OPML in association with RSS. Among other things the syndicated schema definition language may enable the presentation of the S DBMS as the syndication service . Thus the S DBMS may provide the aforementioned syndication specific functions described hereinabove with reference to as they relate to the database. For example in embodiments the S DBMS may act as the content source and thus may publish the data feed to the client . Likewise in embodiments the S DBMS may act as the client and thus may access or subscribe to the data feed from the content source . Similarly in embodiments the S DBMS may act as the aggregator of data feeds and or may republish or replicate the data feed .

The syndicated transaction mechanism may provide concurrent access to the database managed by the S DBMS . This mechanism may provide the ACID properties. Additionally or alternatively the syndicated transaction mechanism may provide the properties of availability scalability mobility serializability and convergence. These additional or alternative properties may apply to embodiments where the database is replicated. Availability may refer to the contents of the S DBMS to be available substantially any time anywhere. As was shown in the previous example of a contact management system availability may require replication of the database recall replicas of the database needed to be maintained on the laptops and in the Exchange Server . Scalability refers to the ability of the S DBMS to gracefully handle increasing numbers of reads and writes to and from the database. Mobility refers to the ability of a disconnected facility such as and without limitation a laptop computer without a data network connection to read and write to a database that is shared amongst many facilities such as the clients and the servers . Serializability refers to the ability to commit transactions that is sets of reads and writes to the database in a serial fashion based for example on the original time of execution of the transactions. Convergence refers to the tendency of the replicas of the database independently modified to tend to converge back to being identical.

The syndicated transaction mechanism may additionally provide one or more of the functionalities known in the art as lazy group replication eager group replication lazy master replication eager master replication and two tier replication. In general these techniques may be adapted for maintenance of an OPML based content pool or a database for syndication content or some combination of these.

Group replication refers to a replication method in which any replica of a database may be updated. Master replication refers to a replication method in which one of the replicas of the database is designated the primary copy and the system managing the primary copy is designated the master. Replication methods of this type allow updates only the primary copy. All other replicas are treated as read only. Moreover only the master is allowed to write to the primary copy. When any system other than the master wants to update the database that system must issue a request to the master to do the update. Lazy replication refers to a replication method in which database updates are applied asynchronously across all replicas. Eager replication refers to a replication method in which database updates are applied all together across all replicas.

Two tier replication may refer to a replication method in which one version of the database is designated the master version and all other versions of the database are designated local versions. Updates to the database replicas that represent local versions are conducted in a lazy group fashion. However these updates are deemed tentative until they have been committed to the master version. Under certain conditions tentative updates may be accepted or rejected as updates to the master. This method is the subject of considerable discussion hereinafter.

The syndicated transaction mechanism may additionally provide one or more additional functionalities known collectively in the art as version control or revision control or versioning. In this case the database may be considered a repository. Data feeds may be written into and read from the database. Perhaps under the direction of the syndicated transaction mechanism the current version of the data feeds may be checked out to a user who wishes to edit the data feeds . During a checkout process the data feeds may become locked. While locked the user may edit a copy of the feeds . The user may then check the edited copy of the feeds back into the database. A check in process may simultaneously unlock the feeds and commit to the database the edits of the feeds . The user that checked out the data feeds may be said to possess the lock and thus may be the only user allowed to check in the feeds . Modifications to the data feeds by any user who does not possess the lock may be prohibited by the syndicated transaction mechanism while the data feeds are locked. This may prevent other would be editors from checking in potentially conflicting modifications to the data feeds . When the user who possesses the lock is ready to commit the changes he has made to the data feeds he checks in his changes which may create a new version or revision of the data feeds . This new version may replace the old version in the database. Or it may simply supersede the old version while the old version or sufficient information to reconstitute the old version from the new version may remain in the database. Alternatively the data feeds may not become locked during the checkout process. In this case it is possible for different users to apply changes to the same version of the data feeds . This may lead to a conflict when the changes are checked in because it may not be obvious to the how to apply all of the different changes to the same version of the data feeds . In these cases the syndicated transaction mechanism may initiate a resolution procedure deferring the check in and perhaps informing the users of the conflicts. The syndicated transaction mechanism may maintain a change list which may identify the changes that have been applied to the data feeds perhaps in sequential order. In embodiments this change list may be maintained in the OPML format or any other format.

The syndicated transaction mechanism may additionally provide one or more additional functionalities known collectively in the art as transaction processing or online transaction processing. These functionalities may allow a series of operations designated as a transaction to be applied to the database either entirely or not at all. A transaction may begin with a directive issued to the syndicated transaction mechanism to initiate a transaction. This directive may be followed by a plurality of queries or other operations to the database. At this point that is during the transaction any updates applied to the database may not be visible to queries or other operations that are not part of the transaction. Finally the transaction may end with a directive to commit the transaction to the database. The commit may succeed or fail. Upon success the updates that were applied to the database during the transaction may become visible to queries or other operations that are not part of the transaction. Upon failure an error code may be issued by the syndicated transaction mechanism and the updates that were applied to the database during the transaction may be discarded.

In another embodiment version and or revision control may be maintained at the OPML level. That is a user may without modifying any underlying content alter an OPML structure that interrelates the content. During this editing process the OPML structure may be checked out to that user or otherwise shielded from concurrent and inconsistent editing. In another embodiment both the OPML structure and the underlying content of all or some of an OPML based content pool may be modified and manipulated by a user as an integral unit.

The syndicated transaction mechanism may also provide any other functionality or implementation of a method or algorithm associated with enabling transactions reads writes updates access control record locking conflict resolution synchronization atomicity consistency isolation durability availability scalability serializability convergence avoidance of lost updates avoidance of system delusion avoidance of scaleup pitfall or any other desirable property or feature of the S DBMS as it may be applied to managing a non replicated database and or a replicated database. Some desirable properties or features may be explicitly mentioned in this disclosure while others may be apparent from this disclosure. All such functions may be deployed at the structural e.g. OPML or data e.g. content levels for improving access to and use of a shared OPML based content pool.

The syndicated analytical mechanism may additionally provide one or more functionalities known collectively in the art as online analytical processing. These functionalities may include taking a snapshot of the database organizing the snapshot of the database along dimensions and processing analytical or other queries against the dimensional organization of the snapshot of the database. The analytical or other queries may be formed according to the syndicated schema definition language or any other suitable language. The dimensional organization of the snapshot of the database may comprise a number of hierarchical organizations of the snapshot of the database wherein the number may have an upper bound defined only by the maximum number of possible hierarchical organizations. For example a database comprising patient data may include ages symptoms and dates of symptom onset. The database may be organized hierarchically by ages symptoms and dates of onset. In one organization the top level of the hierarchy may be ages the next level may be symptoms and the next level may be dates of onset. Many alternate organizations should be apparent. In embodiments the hierarchical organization may be stored presented and or generated in the OPML format. In some embodiments one or more of the dimensional organizations may be produced by the syndicated analytical mechanism but no processing of analytical or other queries may be provided. In other embodiments the syndicated analytical mechanism may both produce one or more dimensional organizations and provide the processing of analytical or other queries against these organizations.

The syndicated analytical mechanism may also provide one or more functionalities aimed at receiving a dimensional organization of the database unpacking the dimensional organization into a full or partial snapshot of the database and updating the database according to the contents of the full or partial snapshot. In practice the step of unpacking the organization may be unnecessary as the syndicated analytical mechanism may be capable of updating the database directly from the contents of the organization. The updating of the database by the syndicated analytical mechanism may be done in conjunction with the syndicated transaction mechanism which may provide one or more of its functionalities to the syndicated analytical mechanism during the updating. In embodiments the receipt of the dimensional organization may be via a mechanism that reads one of the data feeds . Alternatively the receipt of the dimensional organization may be via a Web page submission a file upload a peer to peer data transfer a client server data transfer or any other data transfer.

Referring now to the syndication system which may be capable of providing Internet or other network based syndication may include a publisher a syndicator and a subscriber . The syndicator may include any suitable facility and or facilities that may be capable of 1 receiving data associated with the data feeds via a network such as the internetwork or LAN that may be connected to the syndicator 2 providing syndicated data which may be associated with the original data 3 embodying an instance of the syndicated data as the data feeds or as another syndication format according to the syndication markup language or any other language 4 transmitting the syndicated data as indicated by the arrow from the syndicator to the subscriber 5 receiving the subscriber s subscription request as indicated by the arrow from the subscriber to the syndicator and 6 transmitting a subscription request as indicated by the arrow from the syndicator to the publisher . The publisher may further include any suitable facility and or facilities that may be capable of receiving the syndicator s subscription request.

The syndicated data may include a real time version of the data received by the syndicator and or may include a time delayed version of this data. In any case the syndicate data may include a verbatim reproduction of the received data a partial reproduction of the received data which may without limitation represent a shortened abbreviated abridged digested summarized and or truncated version of the original data a modified instance of the received data such as and without limitation a translation of the original data into another language and or an instance of data generated by a process that may have used the original data as an input. This process may without limitation include a user behavior analyzer a product reviewer and or an aggregator.

In embodiments the publisher the syndicator and or the subscriber may each be associated with its own instance of the DBMS . For example the syndicator may be a Web service that provides aggregation of data feeds . In this case the syndicator may access the data feeds of the publisher and cache these data feeds into its instance of the DBMS . Likewise the publisher may store its news feeds in its instance of the DBMS . Similarly the subscriber may store a local copy of news feeds for offline viewing or archival purposes in its instance of the DBMS . Each of these instances of the DBMS is a separate installation and they are not associated with each other.

Referring now to an embodiment of a syndication system may comprise the S DBMS an interface and a legacy facility .

In embodiments the interface may comprise an implementation of the Open Database Connectivity ODBC API. The legacy facility may comprise an application written to interface with the DBMS but not the S DBMS . The interface as shown may act as middleware between the legacy facility and the S DBMS . The use of ODBC as a bridge or interface between an application and a database is well known in the art.

In other embodiments the interface may comprise an implementation of SMTP IMAP POP or any other protocol associated with e mail. The legacy facility in this case may comprise a legacy e mail client application written to interface with an SMTP IMAP POP or other legacy e mail server. Numerous legacy e mail client applications such as Thunderbird Outlook Express and Lotus Notes are known in the art. When the legacy facility sends an e mail reads an e mail receives an e mail deletes an e mail or performs another action associated with e mail a message or series of messages may be passed between the legacy e mail client and the interface . The interface may convert these messages into the database query language of the S DBMS . These converted messages may be embodied according to the syndicated schema definition language or any other syndication markup language other markup language or other format .

For example without limitation in the case where the legacy facility is a legacy e mail client the interface may convert the message or series of messages from the legacy facility and publish it in an RSS feed. The S DBMS may subscribe to this feed and may appropriately react to changes in the feed. When the legacy facility transmits an outgoing e mail via SMTP to the interface that outgoing e mail may be associated with one or more intended recipients as specified in the to cc and or bcc lines of the e mail. This e mail may be received by the interface and then published by the interface in a sent mail RSS feed . The S DBMS may have subscribed to the sent mail RSS feed of the interface and may recognize a published update to this feed . In response to this update the S DBMS may retrieve the new item in the feed and may update a received mail RSS feed associated with the one or more intended recipients of the e mail. Another interface may be associated with a legacy facility that may be associated with the intended recipient of the e mail. This interface may have subscribed to the received mail RSS feed of the S DBMS . In response to the update of this feed the interface may retrieve the new item in the feed . This new item may comprise the outgoing e mail that is now from the perspective of the intended recipient incoming e mail. The interface may convert the e mail into a message or series of messages that are compatible with POP IMAP or any other application layer Internet protocol used by the legacy facility for accessing e mail.

Referring now to an embodiment of the syndication system may comprise one or more instances of the S DBMS a publisher a syndicator and a subscriber . The publisher may comprise one of the clients or one of the servers and may provide data to the syndicator as indicated by the arrow from the publisher to the syndicator . This data may without limitation be expressed according to the syndication markup language . The syndicator may pull push gather summarize index search filter cluster archive compress decompress or otherwise access and or process this data. The data may be embodied as one or more of the data feeds .

The arrow from the syndicator to the publisher may indicate the access of the syndicated data feed . The syndicator may comprise one of the clients or one of the servers . In some embodiments the syndicator may function as the aggregator or may provide any of the syndication services . The data feeds may be provided to the subscriber in the format that the syndicator received them. Alternatively the data feeds may be provided to the subscriber in an alternate syndication format. For example and without limitation the data feeds may be received by the syndicator in the RSS format and may be provided to the subscriber in the OPML format.

The subscriber may be the one of the clients or one of the servers . The subscriber may subscribe to one or more of the data feeds . The arrow from the subscriber to the syndicator indicates this. The subscriber may receive one or more of the data feeds provided by the syndicator as indicated by the arrow from the syndicator to the subscriber .

Each of the publisher the syndicator and the subscriber may be associated with an instance of the S DBMS as shown. Each of these S DBMS instances may manage a database that is unique. Alternatively the database managed by the instance of the S DBMS may in whole or in part be a replica of a database managed by another instance of the S DBMS . In any case the databases may be associated with one or more of the other databases such as might be the case with a replicated or distributed database. This association is of particular relevance to the present invention and may lead to the conceptual framework described hereinafter with reference to . Alternatively each of these databases may not be associated with any of the other databases. In any case the databases may contain the data feeds metadata associated with the data feeds and other data. In other aspects the S DBMS may itself be implemented as an OPML based content pool structure cooperating with publish subscribe elements of a syndication system.

Referring now to instances of the legacy facility may be associated with the publisher and or the subscriber . In this configuration the instances of the legacy facility may participate as part of an embodiment of the syndication system . The publisher and or the subscriber may function as the interface with respect to the instances of the legacy facility .

The centrally located S DBMS may function as the syndicator described hereinabove with references to and . In this arrangement data management and syndication are unified in contrast to the current state of the art in which syndication is a service built on top of the legacy DBMS .

Referring now to the conceptual framework for a distributed syndicated database management system DS DMBS is depicted. The instances of the S DBMS within the DS DMBS may be operatively coupled via intermittent connections or via continuous connections . In embodiments these connections may comprise the internetwork the hub or LAN server the gateway a USB interface an IrDA interface or any other facility enabling transmission the data feeds . The instances of the S DMBS that are connected to each other via the continuous connections may be referred to as the base nodes. As depicted a base may comprise these base nodes. In embodiments the base may comprise zero or more base nodes. The instances of the S DBMS that are connected to the base nodes via the intermittent connections may be referred to as mobile nodes. In embodiments the DS DBMS may comprise zero or more mobile nodes. In any case each node in the DS DBMS may provide a view of some or all of contents of the one or more databases associated with one or more of the S DBMS nodes. This view may be provided as one or more of the data feeds provided by the S DBMS nodes described in and . The connections allow for the syndication of content between the various nodes of the DS DBMS . The connections also allow for the transmission of control signals that may be dictated by the particular implementation of the syndicated transaction mechanism .

Based upon this disclosure it should now be clear that the aggregator as described hereinbefore with reference to could be implemented as the S DBMS or as the DS DBMS . In an exemplary embodiment the aggregator could comprise one or more of the S DBMS nodes of the DS DBMS . In this case the content sources and the clients may also comprise S DBMS nodes and may together with S DBMS node or nodes of the aggregator constitute the DS DBMS . In this embodiment the syndicated transaction mechanism may implement two tier replication and the syndicated schema definition language may be RSS used in association with OPML .

The DS DBMS whether a conventional database system or an OPML based structure may provide the logical features that connect all participants and in the syndication system to a universal syndication database or database of all syndication databases. Thus the participants may have the illusion of accessing a single shared database to which syndicated data may be published from which syndicated data may be subscribed and in which syndicated data may be modified by a plurality of participants and so forth. As with a conventional DBMS users of the DS DBMS may create different views of the data in the database.

In general a collection of databases and or database management systems including various combinations of the databases and database management systems described above or other combinations is referred to herein as a global data facility. As will be appreciated from the foregoing the global data facility may provide a user or programming interface that permits interaction with the global data facility as though the global data facility were a single database using for example a structured query language. The global data facility may include any number of data sources or databases and may include any number of database management systems. Further relational data across the global data facility may be created and manipulated using any number of techniques. In one embodiment the relational data is maintained is maintained in one or more OPML files.

Referring now to the logical flow of a two tier replication process directed at applying a change to the database is shown. Beginning at the START logical block logical flow proceeds to the APPLY CHANGE logical block where a change is applied to the local version of the database. Then a test is conducted at logical block to determine if the S DBMS node that received the change is the master of the portion of the database that has been changed. If so logical flow proceeds to the test at logical block where the S DBMS determines if it is connected to the base nodes. If so a base transaction is conducted at logical block followed by a test at logical block to see if the base transaction succeeded. If it succeeded then the change has been committed to the master version of the database and the change process ends at END . However if the base transaction fails then the base transaction is retried as shown by a return arrow from logical block to logical block . If the S DBMS is not connected to the base then instead of attempting a base transaction the process flows from logical block to logical block TENTATIVE TRANSACTION where the change to the local version of the database is recorded as a tentative transaction. From there logical flow proceeds to logical block where the process ends.

Referring now to the logical flow of a two tier replication process directed at applying one or more tentative transactions to the base nodes is shown. Beginning at the START logical block logical flow proceeds to the CONNECT logical block where the mobile node connects to one of the base nodes. Next a test is conducted at logical block to determine if the mobile node has any tentative transactions recorded in its local database that have not been processed as a base transaction. If so a base transaction is conducted at logical block . After that a test is conducted at logical block to determine if the base transaction succeeded. If it didn t logical flow returns to logical block BASE TRANSACTION where the base transaction is retried. Otherwise the base transaction succeeded and logical flow returns to the test at logical block . When there are no more tentative transactions that need to be processed as base transactions the test at logical block has a negative result and processing flow continues to logical block DISCONNECT where the mobile node disconnects from the base node. Finally processing flow continues to logical block where the process ends.

Referring now to here is depicted an implementation of a syndication system that provides backward compatibility to legacy devices DS DBMS and or S DBMS implementations may be used. A fixed network which may comprise the Internetwork is operatively coupled to a wireless access point . The wireless access point may be an 802.11 access point a cellular phone tower a satellite or any other device facilitating wireless data transmission between a device and the fixed network .

Transient devices and legacy transient devices which may be clients and or servers may be operatively coupled to the wireless access point or the fixed network . This operative coupling may be enabled by any of a variety of wireless in the case of the wireless access point or tethered in the case of the fixed network transmission media including without limitation optical aural radio frequency quantum or any other wireless or tethered transmission media. The intermittent connections and or the continuous connections may comprise this operative coupling. The transient devices may be comprised of the publisher the syndicator the subscriber and or the S DBMS . The publisher the syndicator and the subscriber may comprise an instance of the S DBMS . The legacy transient devices may be comprised of the legacy facility . The transient devices and the legacy transient devices may be associated with instances of a data store in which the database may be stored. The data store may comprise the memory and or the mass storage devices that may be associated with the clients and or the servers .

Persistent devices and legacy persistent devices which may be the clients and or servers may be operatively coupled to the wireless access point or the fixed network . This operative coupling may be enabled by any of a variety of wireless in the case of the wireless access point or tethered in the case of the fixed network transmission media including without limitation optical aural radio frequency quantum or any other wireless or tethered transmission media. The intermittent connections and or the continuous connections may comprise this operative coupling. The persistent devices may be comprised of the publisher the syndicator the subscriber and or the S DBMS . The legacy persistent devices may be comprised of the legacy facility . The persistent devices and the legacy persistent devices may be associated with instances of the data store .

A network attached storage NAS may be operatively coupled to the fixed network via the persistent connection . The NAS may comprise an instance of the S DBMS . More generally the NAS may incorporate any of the syndication functionality described above such as the services described in reference to which may be deployed as database management functions within the S DBMS or as other services. All such functionality functions and services may be for example incorporated into the NAS as one or more syndication capable semiconductor devices . In one embodiment a pool such as one of the pools described above with reference to may be realized as a NAS with an integrated syndication capable semiconductor device that provides syndication functions in association with the NAS and data stored thereon.

A storage area network SAN may be operatively coupled to the fixed network via the persistent connection . The SAN may comprise an instance of the S DBMS .

As shown the legacy devices may not be directly associated with instances of the data store . Instead these devices may rely on one of the non legacy devices which may be associated with an instance of the data store to perform as the interface in providing access to the S DBMS that may be comprise by the data store .

Any instances of the S DBMS may be associated to form the DS DBMS . For example in an enterprise the DS DBMS may be used to track working versions of documents such as e mail calendars contacts to do items organizational charts presentations Web pages data feeds outlines spreadsheets word processing files diagrams software code access control lists financial data images videos audio files URLs and so forth. The DS DBMS may make provide these documents in a data feed or outline such as in the OPML format.

Referring now to a sample document of the OPML format is shown. In this specification numerous elements are shown four of which are identified as opml head body and outline. The opml element may be the root element of a file in the OPML format. In embodiments such as the present one it may contain a version attribute a head element and a body element. The head element in embodiments may contain metadata. This metadata may include the optional elements shown which are identified as title dateCreated DateModified and ownerName. Other optional elements may include ownerEmail expansionState vertScrollState windowTop windowLeft windowBottom and windowRight. The contents of these optional elements many be plain text. The contents of the dateCreated and dateModified optional elements may conform to the date time format specified in RFC 822 or RFC 2822. The contents of the expansionState optional element may contain a comma separated list of numbers wherein the numbers may be associated with the head elements in an opml file that when rendered may be displayed in an expanded form. The body element may contain one or more outline elements. The outline element may contain zero or more arbitrary attributes and may contain any number of nested outline elements. While the foregoing discussion of the OPML format may refer to version 1.0 of the OPML format it should be appreciated that as of this writing further developments to the OPML format have been publicly anticipated. Incorporation of these and any other developments to the OPML format is within the scope of the present invention.

Embodiments of the syndication system that are associated with a database management system such as the DBMS the S DBMS or DS DBMS may provide a materialized view of the source database managed by the database management system. The materialized view may comprise records fields entries relations hierarchies or any other data originating from the source database. In some cases this view may comprise the hierarchical organization of the database that may be provided by the syndicated analytical mechanism . In any case this view may be provided in the OPML format. This materialized view may be stored on one of the servers or one of the clients . The materialized view may be delivered to the client as one of the data feeds . The materialized view may be presented to the user such as by a via an application programming running on the client . Alternatively the materialized view itself may be treated as a database and thus may be queried searched filtered or otherwise processed. The view may be stored as a flat file a table a set of fields and relations or any other database format. The view may be subject to versioning transactions analysis or any other database management or data processing function. The view may be modified by the client or the server and then submitted back the database management system where it may be committed to the source database. The view may contain records that are locked in the source database. This may ensure that the records in the view are consistent with the corresponding records in the source database. The view may comprise a current or historical snapshot of aspects of the source database. The view may be generated once and thenceforth be static. Alternatively the view may by dynamic and this subject to real time or near real time updates from the database management system. In this case updates to the view may be published as one of the data feeds which may be received by one of the clients . Updates to the view may be received directly from the database management system by one of the servers that is charged with maintaining the view. In some embodiments the view may be maintained entirely within the database management system.

A query or a sequence or set of queries may be submitted to the database management system to create the view. Depending upon the particular query or which database management system is being utilized or the query may be processed by the transaction mechanism the syndicated transaction mechanism and or the syndicated analytical mechanism . In any case this query may originate directly from a user of one of the clients . For example a user may enter a keyword phrase or sequence or set of keywords or phrases into a text box in a Web browser or the user interface of any other software application running on the client . The entry or entries into the text box may be transmitted directly to the database management system for processing. Alternatively the entry or entries may be received by a software application running on one of the clients or on one of the servers . In this case the software application may translate the entry or entries into the form of a query that may be suitable for submission to the database management system. In some embodiments an automatic software facility may monitor inputs from the user of one of the clients and may automatically formulate the query based upon these inputs.

For example and without limitation in an e commerce application the automatic software facility may reside on one of the servers and may observe that the user is browsing particular items in an on line store. These items may be just a few of a plurality of items that may be stored in the database. The automatic software facility may recognize a commonality among the browsed items for example that they are all camping goods or may recognize an association between the browsed items and other items for example that other people who also viewed the browsed items expressed interest in other particular items .

In generating the view the database management system may process tags or metadata that may be associated with the entries in the database. These tags may exist within the database in one or more of the data feeds in the content source or in any data storage facility within the syndication system . In one aspect the tags may identify a categorization of the entries such as topical area of interest source author publication date content rating such as and without limitation the Motion Picture Association of America ratings G PG R etc. the Amazon.com 5 star rating the Zagat Rating a user consensus rating akin to the eBay user feedback rating and so forth or any other categorization a very large number of which should be apparent. In any case the database management system may generate the view in whole or in part based upon the tags. For example and without limitation in response to a query requesting a view related to hunting the database management system may scan all tags in the database and or associated with entries in the database for the word hunting. The materialized view in this example may comprise some or all of the entries associated with a tag containing hunting. 

In embodiments a plurality of views or other OPML files may reside in a database or other facility capable of storing information. As is mentioned hereinbefore one aspect of the present invention may be to provide transaction analysis and versioning services in association with these files.

In one of many possible applications of the syndication system a number of databases containing healthcare related information may be viewed and or updated. Generally for a variety of legal and organizational reasons it is common for healthcare related information to be widely disbursed across a number of databases. For the purposes of having a concrete example of this one application a hypothetical scenario follows. This scenario may be referred to in the detailed descriptions of and .

In a hypothetical scenario one of the databases may contain hematologic lab test results associated patient identification codes. Another database may contain digitized X ray images associated with patient identification codes. Yet another database may contain patient contact information and health insurance information associated with patient identification codes. Still yet another database may contain social security numbers associated with patient identification codes. The syndication system or aspects of it may be utilized to provide a plurality of views of these databases. Some views may be directed at a lateral organization of the information. Other views may be directed at a hierarchical organization of the information.

Referring now to for the purpose of illustration and not limitation a lateral organization may be presented in a table or a flat file. Here database entries associated with patient identification code 143943 are displayed in a lateral view . Two hematologic test results are shown perhaps corresponding to two entries in the database that contains hematologic lab test results associated with patient identification codes. A URL pointing to an X ray image is shown perhaps corresponding to an entry in the database that contains digitized X ray images associated with patient identification codes. Contact information and health insurance information are shown perhaps corresponding to one or two entries in the database that contains patient contact information and health insurance information associated with patient identification codes. A social security number SSN is shown perhaps corresponding to an entry in the database that contains social security numbers associated with patient identification codes. A benefit of this view may be that it obscures whether there are one or more databases from which the information in the view is drawn. Another benefit of this view may be that it obscures whether the databases from which the information is drawn exist in one or more divisions offices organizations functional areas or other business private or governmental units. Still another benefit of this view may be that it obscures whether the databases from which the information is drawn are managed by DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS . Yet still another benefit of this view may be that it obscures the physical and or logical organization of the information as it exists in the database s . Other benefits of this view will be apparent.

Referring now to for the purpose of illustration and not limitation a hierarchical organization may presented in the OPML format as a hierarchical view that includes the feed . Here database entries are organized primarily by hematologic lab test result and secondarily by patient identification code. At the top level of the XML structure is the opml element. That is followed by the head element which contains two elements title and dateCreated each of which contain plain text metadata. Immediately following the close of the head element appears the body element which contains nested outline elements. The top level outline element has a title attribute hematologic lab test results . Within that element are three nested outline elements each of which has a title attribute respectively LDL189 . These elements may correspond to ranges of LDL cholesterol that may be stored in the database that contains hematologic lab test results associated with patient identification codes. Within the first of these three nested outlines are two nested outline elements Patient 43523 and Patient 54343 . These elements may correspond to patient identification numbers which may be stored in a number of databases. Within both of the Patient elements are an X ray images element and a health insurance information element. These elements contain leaf outline elements which do not contain further nesting. The values of the attributes of these leaves may be associated with the database that contains digitized X ray images associated with patient identification codes and the database that contains contact information and health insurance information associated with patient identification codes. The ellipsis in the LDL 100 to 189 and the LDL 189 elements indicate that the contents of these elements may be analogous to the contents of the LDL

Referring now to for the purpose of illustration and not limitation an interactive rendering of the hierarchical view described hereinbefore with reference to is shown. In embodiments the rendering may appear on a visual user interface associated with one of the clients and may be generated by an application running on the client . In the rendering the title element of the head element of the hierarchical view is displayed in bold type. Below that the hierarchy is displayed with some elements expanded and other not. Expanded elements are indicated by a rightward pointing triangle. Unexpanded elements are indicated by a downward pointing triangle. Leaf elements are indicated by a circle. The structural hierarchy of the view is redundantly displayed both by indentation and by horizontal and vertical lines. In embodiments a user at the client may interact with this rendering such as by clicking on the triangles to toggle their orientation from rightward facing to downward facing and vice versa. As the state of different elements is changed between expanded and unexpanded the rendering may be updated to reveal or hide appropriate parts of the view . This rendering may have all of the benefits of the hierarchical view as described hereinabove with reference to . Another benefit of the rendering may be to allow the user to rapidly drill down to information of interest. Still other benefits of the rendering will be apparent. It should be appreciated that the application providing the rendering may also allow the user to modify the information displayed in elements of the view . These changes may be transmitted back to the database management system to be committed to the affected database or databases. When the changes are transmitted they may be transmitted in the form of the hierarchical view and may be processed as described hereinbefore with reference to .

Generally in embodiments each instance of the objects may receive and or subscribe to one or more of the data feeds some of which are described herein and other of which will be apparent.

It will be appreciated that there exist many applications of the system for providing aerospace defense and transportation services. It will further be appreciated that any or all of the following features and aspects of the embodiment of the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS may be employed in instances of the system or any other syndication system. Various illustrative aspects of an implementation of the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS are described hereinafter. A more detailed description of a suitable DBMS is provided in Fundamentals of Database Systems by Ramez Elmasri and Shamkant B. Navathe fourth edition published by Addison Wesley 2004 the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.

In the context of the system and in general embodiments the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS may comprise a software server that provides data in a format associated with syndication such as OPML or in another format such as those described hereinabove with reference to .

The software server may manage one or more data files that together may comprise the database. The database may be composed of records. These data files may be organized in a way that is optimized for rapid storage and retrieval to and from a physical disk such as a platter in a hard disk drive. On the platter these data files typically are logically arranged as disk pages or blocks. Various organization methods for data files are known in the art and generally fall into one of three categories unordered ordered and hashed. These organization methods may be supplemented and storage retrieval performance may be further enhanced with an application of an access structure known in the art as an index. In some embodiments the index may comprise one level and may generally be implemented as a primary a clustering index a secondary index a multicolumn index a combination of indexes a unique index and or a partial index all of which are well known in the art. In other embodiments the index may comprise multiple levels and may generally be implemented as a B tree a B tree an R tree a hash or another implementation such as may be supported by an infrastructure such as GiST that supports the specification of multiple and or arbitrary index strategies. On still other embodiments any combination of organization methods and indexes may be applied. In the system or any other syndication system the database may contain a message in the OPML format and of which the data feed may be comprised.

The software server may support one or more logical connections provided in association with an authentication technique. In some embodiments a software application that accesses the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS may be running on the client while the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS itself is running on the server . In other embodiments the software application may be running on the server and the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS may be running on the client . In any case the connection may comprise data communications for example and without limitation TCP IP data communications between the client and the server . To establish such communications the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS may require that the client or the software application running on the client be authenticated and or the client may require that the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS be authenticated. Various methods of authentication are known in the art such as password public key keyboard interactive and GSSAPI. In the system the ground vehicle may authenticate the ground communication platform prior to accepting an OPML file via the data feed provided by the ground communication platform .

Operation of the software server may require the consumption of computing resources. These resources may include network bandwidth central processing unit cycles primary memory primary memory bandwidth secondary storage secondary storage bandwidth and so forth. The implementation of the software server may generally be directed toward a balance of reduced resource consumption combined with increased performance characteristics of the software server. These performance characteristics may be measured in terms of latency and or response time. It will be appreciated that the physical implementation of the server and or client may be directed at boosting the performance of the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS such as by providing additional bandwidth cycles and or memory. Likewise it will be appreciated that the increased performance of the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS may lead to increased performance of an overall system that includes the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS . For example in the system or any other syndication system the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS may in some respect reduce resource consumption by publishing summaries of the feed in the form of an OPML data file thus saving bandwidth and perhaps improving the performance of the system or other syndication system.

The software server may include a method generally known as a recovery method or recovery method. The recovery method may provide for the restoration of the database to the most recent consistent state prior to a failure. The recovery method may rely on what is generally known as a log file which may contain a sequential historical list of operations applied to the database.

The failure may be a power failure hardware failure software failure or any other systemic catastrophe that may adversely affect the operation of the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS . The system failure may cause widespread damage to the database. In this case the recovery method may provide for retrieving an archived version of the database in a state that is known to be consistent. To this retrieved database the recovery method may redo operations to the database according to the instructions in the log file.

Alternatively the failure may comprise a minor system failure or a logical failure such as a failure of main memory or a portion thereof a failure of a transaction to complete such as due to interruption failure of a consistency test and so forth a failure of primary storage or any of a host of other possible such failures. In this case localized inconsistency to the database could be possible. To recover from this the recovery method may provide for undoing and or redoing operations to the database according to entries in a log file without consulting an archived version of the database.

In some embodiments the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS may employ a method known in the art as in place updating. In this method when a block of which the database is comprised is read from disk its physical location on the disk is noted. The contents of this block may be modified in primary storage and then written back to disk. When the block is written back to disk it is written to the same physical location from which it was originally read. Thus once written to disk the old version of the block is lost. If a system failure occurs while the block is being written to disk the data in the block may become corrupted such as do to the block being partially overwritten and the database therefore may be in an inconsistent state. To recover from this situation a technique known in the art as write ahead logging may be employed. The write ahead log is created and maintained by the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS and contains undo and redo instructions corresponding to actions applied to the database. The DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS ensures that before attempting to write a block of which the database is comprised the undo and redo commands associated with the changes in the block are written to disk in the form of a write ahead log. Thus should there be a system failure during the writing of the log the write ahead log may become corrupted but this is of no consequence as the database would be consistent. Should there be a failure during the writing of the database the write ahead log would contain all the information required to convert either an old but consistent version of the database into the most recent consistent state or to convert a current but inconsistent version of the database back into its most recent consistent state.

In the system or any other syndication system many possible applications of the recovery method are evident. One application may involve the publication of an OPML file from an instance of the aerial vehicle to the ground communication platform . Subsequent to receipt of the OPML file the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS in the ground communication platform may write the OPML file to the database on disk. During this write operation a power loss may disable the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS leaving the database in an inconsistent state. When the power comes back on the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS may retrieve an archived copy of the database read instructions from the write ahead log corresponding to the previously attempted write of the OPML file and apply these instructions to restore the database to a current and consistent state.

The software server may translate a query from an intermediate form into an execution plan. This translation may be performed by a component of the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS known as a query optimizer. The query optimizer may determine an efficient strategy for executing the query and may embody this strategy as the execution plan. The query optimizer may utilize techniques known in the art as pipelining heuristics selectivity or cost estimates. The techniques may include rules based techniques cost based techniques semantic processing or any other query optimization technique. In the system or any other syndication system the query optimizer may be employed as much as every time a query associated with an OPML file is submitted to the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS .

The software server from time to time may detect an error. A vast number of sources of the error will be appreciated and may comprise a software server configuration error a persistent or intermittent hardware error a network error a data communications error a programming error such as a bug in the software server an attempt to process a malformed query a failed authentication attempt and the like. When such errors are detected the software server may write information describing or associated with the error to a log file which may be specially designated as an log file for error logging. In one example the software server in the system may detect when it receives a malformed query associated with retrieving or generating an OPML file. Upon detection the software server may write to the information describing the error to the log file for error logging.

The software server may monitor and collect run time statistics associated with the performance of the software server including statistics specifically associated with queries query processing and indexes. A number of these statistics are discussed in PostgreSQL 8.1.0 Documentation written and published by The PostgreSQL Global Development Group 2005 included herein by reference. These statistics may without limitation comprise a database object ID a database name a process ID a user object ID a user name a current query a time at which the current query began execution a time at which the process was started an IP address of the client an IP port of the client a number associated with active service processes connected to the a database a number associated with transactions committed and or rolled back in the database a number associated with a count of disk blocks read a number associated with a total count of buffer hits a schema name a table name a number associated with a count of sequential scans initiated a number associated with a count of live rows fetched by sequential scan a number associated with a count of index scans initiated a number associated with a count of row insertions a number associated with a count of row updates a number associated with a count of row deletions an index name a number associated with a count of index scans initiated on a particular index a number associated with a count of index entries returned by index scans a number associated with a count of live table rows fetched by simple index scans using that index a number associated with a count of disk blocks read from a table a number associated with a count of disk blocks read and buffer hits in all indexes of a table a number associated with a count of disk blocks read and buffer hits from a table s auxiliary table a number associated with a count of disk blocks read and buffer hits for an auxiliary table s index a table object ID associated with an index in a database an index object ID associated with an index in the database a table name associated with a database an index name associated with a database a number associated with a count of disk blocks read in an index a number associated with a count of buffer hits in a index a sequence object a sequence object ID a schema associated with a sequence a name associated with a sequence a number associated with a count of disk blocks read in a sequence a number associated with a count of buffer hits in a sequence and the like. In the system or any other syndication system these run time statistics may assist a maintainer of the system or other syndication system in optimizing the performance of the system or other syndication system and or troubleshooting aspects of the system or other syndication system associated with processing OPML .

The software server may conduct routine maintenance tasks directed at providing consistent and reliable database performance. On such task may be referred to as vacuuming in which disk space associated with updated or deleted rows in tables in the database may be recovered usage statistics used by the query optimizer may be updated and so forth. In some embodiments the task of vacuuming may be automated such as performed according to a temporal schedule. Another such task may be referred to as reindexing which may involve recalculating the indexes in the database to remedy an inefficient use of memory and or disk space associated with the indexes which may develop over time as the database is used. Yet another such task may be directed at properly maintaining log files which may grow to contain vast and potentially unlimited quantities of information as the database is used. Given that unlimited information storage space is never available the log files may from time to time be rotated a technique that is well known in the art. It will be appreciated that in the system or any other syndication system routine maintenance tasks performed by or in association with the software server may assist in maintaining the consistent and reliable performance of the system or other syndication system.

The software server my support any number of concurrent connections from clients or client connections wherein the connections may comprise the logical connections described hereinabove. The client connections may be directed at a single database which may be specified in an initial request to establish the client connection. In the system or any other syndication system any of the servers may accept client connections through which may occur the transmission of queries and results both of which may be associated with OPML .

The software server may support the locking of tables rows elements and or fields in the database. Generally locking provides one transaction the transaction that holds the lock greater access to the locked entity than is granted to other transactions. In one example locking may provide read write access to the one transaction and no access to the other transactions. In another example locking may provide read write access to the one transaction and read only access to the other transactions. When an entity becomes locked this fact may be associated with a lock ID which may be stored in a data structure commonly known as a lock table. Typically when a transaction is denied access to an entity because of the lock the transaction may wait until the lock is released by the transaction that holds the lock. In practice it is possible that from time to time two or more transactions will become deadlocked as they simultaneously wait for locks held by each other. The software server perhaps in accordance with a timeout parameter may check to see if a deadlock exists after a transaction has been waiting for an amount of time in excess of that specified by the timeout parameter. If a deadlock is detected the software server may cancel or roll back one or more of the transactions to resolve the deadlock condition. As an alternative to or in addition to locking the software server may support a concurrency control technique that is known in the art as multiversion concurrency control MVCC . In any case in the system lock management or some other method of concurrency control may be used in many readily apparent circumstances associated with OPML .

The software server may support set of access permissions wherein the set may be referred to as a role and the permissions may be referred to as privileges. Each role may have a name and may be associated with one or more users of the database. The privileges may relate to various permissions to access and or modify the database. A user may or may not be authorized to delegate permissions and or roles to another user. In just one of many evident examples provided here for the purposes of illustration and not limitation the software server in the system may contain a regulatory role which comprises permissions to write to a database table containing regulations. This role may be associated with the regulatory facility . Thus the software server may allow only the regulatory facility to update the table containing regulations.

The software server may allow users to insert code into it thus enhancing modifying and or limiting the functionality of the software server. Generally this inserted code may comprise any code whatsoever. Due to the sweeping capabilities and therefore potential for abuse this software server may allow only a particularly privileged user commonly known as the superuser to insert this code. These functions may be automatically activated or triggered according to a trigger or event defined by the user that inserted the code. Such an event may be the execution of a particular database function the passage of a particular amount of time an external signal and so forth. In the system triggers may be utilized to automatically update OPML files when information in the database that is associated with the OPML file is modified. Many other applications of triggers in the system or any other syndication system are evident.

The software server may provide for creating configuring and destroying the database. The database may be a collection of schemas comprising tables functions and the like. The creation of the database may associate a name with the database and may comprise copying an existing database or database template. The database template may be a specially crafted database that exists to provide a well defined standard starting point and or initial configuration for all new databases. The database template generally may comprise any database that is designated to be copied for the purposes of providing the starting point and or initial configuration of a newly created database. It should be apparent that the creation configuration and destruction of the database as well as the database template may be essential and integral to the operation of the system or any other syndication system. In one aspect the software server may provide for creating configuration and or destroying data relationships independent from the underlying data. This may have particular applicability where as with an OPML RSS based architecture the relationships are by their nature expressed independently from the data.

The software server may provide a feature known as locale support that allows for the representation of multiple alphabets character sets sorting orders number formats and the like. In the system or any other syndication system the locale support may allow OPML files to be represented stored created modified or otherwise processed or provided according to a language alphabet number format or other local preference associated with a deployment or use of the system or other syndication system.

The software server may provide what is known in the art as backup and restore functionality. In some embodiments the backup may involve the creation of an SQL dump which is a set of SQL instructions that when provided to the software server will recreate the database represented by the dump as it existed at the time that the dump was originally created. In other embodiments the backup may involve making a copy of the files that the software server stores on disk. Other backup and restore techniques exist such as those that involve applying the write ahead log to a backup copy of the database the result of which may be to provide for restoring the database to a nearly up to date state even though the backup copy of the database may be relatively old. In the system or any other syndication system the backup functionality may be employed periodically in any or all of the instances of the software server to insure that there is an recent backup of the database should a failure or error occur that necessitates restoring the database. Backup and restore may be provided independently for data and for data relationships.

The software server may provide or be associated with regression tests. These test may allow the integrity reliability functionality or any feature of the server to be tested to ensure that failures bugs configuration problems or other mistakes or errors have not been introduced into the server. In the system or any other syndication system these tests may comprise a comprehensive set of operations perhaps expressed as SQL or XQuery directed at supporting OPML files as they may be associated with the software server.

The software server may support a number of client interfaces which may be software facilities by which the client may access the software server running on the server . These software facilities may take the form of a software library which may be written in a language such as C Java or any other programming language. These software facilities may be directed at one particular brand of software server or may be directed at providing a singular or unified interface for clients to a plurality of brands of software server. Clearly any client that accesses the software server in the system may utilize or be implemented with one or more of the client interfaces.

The database managed by the software server may be embodied as one or more data structures. A table in the database may consist of a number of rows and columns. The number and order of the columns may be fixed and each column may be associated with a name. The number and order of the rows may be variable. Values stored in the table may or may not be subjects to defaults and constraints. Many detailed aspects of the table are well known in the art. In one aspect data structures of a relational database may be captured in an OPML structure and associated with unstructured data through external references.

In embodiments the tables may be accessed directly or may be accessed through a view which may be a query associated with a name that may be referred to in other queries as though it were a table. The result of the query associated with the name may be stored as an object in the database in which case the view may be referred to as a materialized view. In any case the table view and or materialized view any or all of which may be generally referred to herein as the table may contain a representation of an array of one or more dimensions.

An index used in association with the table may comprise an specialized index known as an application domain index that may be tailored to a custom data type such as an OPML file that may not traditionally be found in a stock implementation the DBMS S DBMS or DS DBMS .

A plurality of tables may be stored in an arrangement known as a cluster or tablespace in which tables that are often accessed together share the same data blocks which collectively may be referred to as an extent or a segment thus potentially improving system performance by minimizing the space and or time required to access and or modify the clustered tables. In a special application of the cluster the rows in the tables are stored in an order associated with the result of a hash function potentially further improving system performance especially in some circumstances such as tables are frequently queried to find entries that are equal to a specified value.

Some embodiments of the software server may provide support for a synonym which may be an alias for any table view materialized view sequence trigger function type synonym and the like. Some rows may contain a value such as and without limitation unique identification number may need to be generated uniquely and sequentially even in the case where multiple rows are being created by different users at the same time. To support this generation the software server may include a sequence generator that provides this functionality.

Each table may contain one or more columns referred to as system columns which may be implicitly defined by the software server when the table is created. Alternatively or additionally a read only set of tables and views collectively referred to as a data dictionary may be created and maintained by the software server. In any case the system columns or the data dictionary may contain fields which may contain data sometimes referred to as database object metadata that are used by the software server in processing queries maintaining the consistency of the values in the table and so forth.

The table may in some cases be modified after it is created and perhaps even after it is filled with data. These modifications may include addition of a column removal of a column addition of a constraint removal of a constraint modification of a default value modification of a column data type modification of the name of a column modification of the name of the table and so forth.

To prevent the removal of a column or table on which another table may depend such as due to a foreign key constraint the software system may implement a feature commonly known as dependency tracking which may detect such a dependency and prevent the removal of such a column or table.

The software server may support a feature known as table inheritance which allows one table to inherit all of the columns of an another table referred to as its parent table. In practice a table may inherit from any number of tables and queries may be applied to all rows of a table and or all rows of a table and the tables that inherit from it.

To improve performance the table may be partitioned or split into a number of smaller tables that together logically form one large table. This split may result in some rows existing in one of the smaller tables with other rows existing in another of the smaller tables. The software server may in addition to tables support other database objects including without limitation views functions operators data types domains triggers rewrite rules and any other database object. Of the numerous features functions and aspects of the software server that are mentioned in the preceding paragraphs describing tables and associated functions and features a tremendous number of embodiments and uses are apparent as they relate to the use of OPML in the system .

The data stored by the software server in a table of the database may be manipulated. This manipulation may comprise an insert delete and or update operation. It should be clear that without these operations the software server would be of limited or no use in the system or any other syndication system.

The software server may process a query. This query may comprise a command to retrieve data from the database. In the art the act of processing the query may be referred to as querying. In embodiments querying may be the primary or only way of retrieving data from the database. The query may be expressed in terms of SQL XQuery or any other query language. Clearly the application of the software server in the system or any other syndication system may require querying and the use of queries.

The software server may support any number of data types with respect to the data that may be stored in the database. These types may without limitation be numeric monetary alphanumeric binary directed toward representing a date directed toward representing a time Boolean geometric directed toward representing a network address a set of bits an array composite complex directed toward representing an object ID directed toward describing the structure of a row or record and the like. The software server may implicitly and or explicitly convert data from one type to another during the processing a query. It is readily apparent that data types may be a fundamental and essential aspect of the software server as it applies to the system or any other syndication system.

The software server may support any number of functions and or operators that may be applied to the data in the database and or other parameters associated with the software server. These functions and or operators may or may not be defined in a stock implementation of the software server may or may not be defined by the query language and may or may not be defined by the user of the software server. These functions and or operators may be directed at manipulating or processing logic a comparison mathematics a string a binary string a bit string a format a date a time geometry a network address a sequence a condition an array an aggregate a query a row a set system information and the like. Furthermore the functions and or operators may be directed at system administration. Many applications of such functions and or operators are apparent as they relate to the system or any other syndication system.

The software server may comprise facilities that are directed at the supporting XML and or OPML . These facilities may comprise what are known in the art as an XML processor an object processor and or an object composer. The software server may be capable of accepting incoming messages in the XPath and or XQuery formats delivered via HTTP SOAP. The software server may be capable of providing messages in the XML OPML the Wireless Markup Language WML which is a species of XML and or non XML formats for example HTML . Many applications of these facilities are apparent as they relate to the system or any other syndication system.

Any or all of the database functions features and architectures may be employed with the enhanced syndication systems described herein. In various embodiments a database management system may reproduce aspects of the above database systems across an environment where unstructured data including syndication data is associated through an outline or other expression of data relationships. In other embodiments a database management system may be employed to support various elements of an enhanced syndication system such as pools data services security transactions infrastructure semantic processing and so forth. All such variations are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure.

In embodiments systems and methods are presented that involve providing records including a first data item and a second data item the first data item including personal data and the second data item including non personal data. The first data item may be transmitted to a secure data pool and the second data item may be transmitted to an unsecure data pool. The two data items may have a relationship but they may be provided to users through different interfaces with different security policies and for different purposes. For example a data storage routine such as this may be used in a situation where one wants to store information that can be separated into two or more parts and the two or more parts may have part specific security features or handling parameters. For example healthcare data may be divided into personal and non personal information. The personal information e.g. payment information such as credit card information may be provided through a conditional access security facility adapted to protect the personal information. This may require a high degree of security as well as a connection with other facilities such as a bank where the information is credit card information. The personal security facility may for example ensure anyone accessing the information has authority to do so and that the information is being accessed for the proper reason e.g. a credit payment . Likewise the non personal information may be protected by another security facility. The non personal security facility may have different levels of conditional access and may be generally higher or lower in its level as compared to the personal security facility . For example the non personal information may relate to heath care testing but it may not be personally identifiable. Doctors in general may be able to access the non personal data by entering information into the security facility that identify the person as a doctor and thus permitted.

The data items stored in the separate data pools may be syndicated data items the data items may be syndicated in the pool or the data items may be processed to form syndicated data items at some point in the process of loading them into the pool or extracting them from the pools. Once stored in the separate pools a collection facility such as a crawler or spider may search for the non personal data and extract the non personal data from the non personal data pool. However when this spider comes to the secure pool it may need access codes or protocols to enter the pool. Without proper authentication the crawler may not be able to take any data from the pool. Similarly a crawler may have proper access protocols to enter the pool and once inside the pool it may require further permissions to take any of the specific data. For example it may have the proper authority to take data specific to a particular person e.g. because that person s physician sent the crawler . Thus in one aspect a spider may be configured to receive security credentials and apply them at appropriate times during a spidering process. In another aspect the spider may be adapted to stop spidering activity when confronted with a security request and present the request such as a request for a username and or password to a user that initiated the spider.

There are several ways to provide secure syndicated information. For example a data pool containing syndicated information may itself be secured so access to the pool is made conditional. As another example the syndicated data in the data pool may be protected through a security facility such as wrapping the syndicated data in a secure layer that has with it a conditional access or conditional collection ability. In addition the data streams going into and out of the pools may be secured or otherwise protected. In another aspect depersonalizing and distributing data across a number of pools provides inherent security. Relationships among the distributed data may be retained for example in an OPML file or other structured format which may itself be stored in a secure location such as another pool.

Syndicated data may be secured in pools but it may also be secured through data streams. The data streams may be inbound data streams e.g. storage of the data into the pool from a published source or outbound data streams e.g. collection feeds . The streams may be protected by encoding the data prior to transmitting the data or before allowing the data to be collected from a collection facility such as a spider. A decoder may be associated with a pool such that encoded information transmitted into the pool is available for collection without the need for decoding after collection.

In embodiments systems and methods are provided that involve providing a device based facility for subscribing to syndicated information. The device based facility may also include a local security facility that permits a user of the device to access the syndicated information. For example the device may have a subscription facility adapted to collect personal information related to the owner of the device. So the device may be continually collecting personal information healthcare information or other information and to properly protect the collected information the device may have a security facility e.g. such as a software operated pass code system . Likewise systems and methods may be involve providing a device based facility for publishing syndicated information and providing a local security facility associated with the device that permits a user of the device to publish the syndicated information. The user of the device may want to publish certain information and the device may require proper authorization from the user prior to executing the publication function.

In embodiments systems and methods are provided that involve receiving syndicated data displaying the syndicated data and destroying the syndicated data after display. For example a kiosk credit card payment station or other facility may be adapted to collect information e.g. personal information to verify a transaction or make some other use of the information. However once the transaction is verified or the information is otherwise used the system that collected the syndicated information may destroy the data. In certain embodiments the destruction is certified and the certification may be sent to an authorized agent to verify the proper destruction of the data.

In embodiments systems and methods are provided that involve providing a set of pools of data configured to be syndicated for use by one or more subscription facilities where the location of the pools is optimized on a network to facilitate rapid access by frequent subscribers. For example a healthcare pool of data may be valuable in helping doctors diagnose certain ailments. Doctors on in California Massachusetts Germany and elsewhere would like access to the information that is generated and deposited into the pool. To increase the speed at which the access can be accomplished from the several geographic regions the pool of data may be replicated and the replicates may be store in geographic regions near the access points. Then the different doctors in the different locations can instruct their collection facilities e.g. spiders to go to the local pool because they will get the information quicker. The spider may also go to the remotely located pools to see if there is any updated or non replicated information that is relevant for collecting. The pools of syndicated data may also be separately populated with locally generated or collected information and the several pools may be updated and replicated periodically or through a syndication service of there own.

In embodiments systems and methods are provided that involve providing a data facility for healthcare information wherein the data facility provides a structure for subscribing to syndicated healthcare data wherein a user may modify the structure through which the user accesses the syndicated health care data. For example the structure may be a security structure where the user has the ability to manipulate the structure or features of the structure e.g. whether the password facility is turned on .

In embodiments systems and methods are provided that involve allowing a user anonymous access to health care data. The systems and methods may involve disposing the health care data in a secure pool generating a secure key that allows a user access to the secure pool providing the user the key and certifying the destruction of the record that the user has access to the key. In embodiments the key allows time based user access. This can be a useful way of creating an anonymous access procedure to health care or other forms of data.

In embodiments systems and methods are provided that involve publishing of authenticated health care data. The systems and methods may involve disposing health care data into a plurality of pools the health care data being disposed by authenticated sources and syndicating the data wherein the syndicated data is associated with an authentication certificate that certifies that the data has been published by an authenticated pool. For example in drug testing biopsy results or other services that require lab certification a certification from the lab may be included with the data. The certification may for example be disposed in a field within an OPML structure.

In embodiments systems and methods are provided that involve anonymous publication of syndicated data. The methods and systems may involve storing data into a plurality of data storage facilities authenticating the identity of the entity storing the data de identifying the data and syndicating the data. This may provide authenticated data in a pool but when the data is extracted e.g. through a spider or other collection facility one may not be able to identify from where it originated or was authenticated. So the lab may not be identifiable but the data that is extracted can be considered authenticated. In embodiments there may be a step that involves verifying the certifying lab is in good standing so people who extract data from the pool can remain confident in the authentic nature of the data.

In embodiments systems and methods are provided that involve dynamically generating syndicated data. The methods and systems may involve receiving a request for a data feed from a requester processing the request to provide responsive content and publishing the responsive content as the data feed. There are many times where the sought after information is not in a syndication format and it needs to be converted e.g. converting a power point presentation into OPML . In embodiments the request may be processed without the requester knowing the conversion even needed to be made. The process may go on in real time or quasi real time. The process may also involve sending the request off to a secondary process where a secondary process like a security check takes place prior to converting and or transmitting the syndicated information. A requestor may pose a security threat and the secondary process may identify the threat. In this situation the syndicated information may not be provided. In addition the secondary process may involve sending the request or information relating to the request to another agency for security analysis.

While the invention has been disclosed in connection with the preferred embodiments shown and described in detail various modifications and improvements thereon will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly the spirit and scope of the present invention as claimed below is not to be limited by the foregoing examples but is to be understood in the broadest sense allowable by law.
