title: System and method for determining and representing one or more potential physical locations of a newly detected wireless network device
abstract: A previously unknown wireless device, which may be either an access point or a station, is detected by receipt of transmissions from that device at one or more access points that are currently operating within a managed wireless network. A graphic representation of the newly detected device is displayed in a region of a user interface external to a region containing a representation of the physical environment of the managed wireless network. A user selects a number of known access points from which an estimated distance to the newly detected device is to be determined and represented. A representation is generated of an estimated distance from each one of the selected number of access points, such as those access points that are estimated to be physically closest to the newly detected device, for example on the basis of signal strength with regard to transmissions from the newly detected device received at the known access points. The distance representations from the known access points may be provided using substantially circular “distance rings”, displayed in the region of the user interface containing a representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed. The distance rings enable a user to may observe one or more distance ring intersections indicating one or more potential positions within the wireless network's physical environment at which the newly detected device may be located.

This application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 937 550 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 085 558 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING AND REPRESENTING ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL PHYSICAL LOCATIONS OF A NEWLY DETECTED WIRELESS NETWORK DEVICE filed Sep. 9 2004 which is a Continuation in Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 855 669 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 043 277 entitled AUTOMATICALLY POPULATED DISPLAY REGIONS FOR DISCOVERED ACCESS POINTS AND STATIONS IN A USER INTERFACE REPRESENTING A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORK DEPLOYED IN A PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT and filed May 27 2004 all disclosures of which are hereby included by reference herein.

The disclosed system relates generally to wireless communication systems and more specifically to a system and method for determining and representing one or more potential physical locations of a newly detected wireless network device.

Wireless communication networks are becoming increasingly common for interconnecting many types of electronic devices. Computer systems of all sizes personal digital assistants input output devices entertainment system components and other types of home appliances are all examples of client station devices that are candidates for interconnection using a wireless communication network. Various specific wireless communication protocols have been developed. Examples of existing wireless communication protocols may be found in the family of standards for wireless Local Area Networks LANs known as IEEE 802.11 including the 802.11a 802.11b and 802.11g wireless communication standards.

Generally wireless networks include some number of access devices referred to herein as access points that provide network access to some number of wireless client devices referred to herein as stations . For example an access point in a wireless network may be connected to a wired communication network and client stations using the wireless network are provided wireless access to the wired network through the access point.

Existing systems for managing wireless networks have provided inconvenient overly costly and or inadequate tools for determining the physical position of a newly added or newly operational access points and or station. In general a problem may arise when a new wireless device is added to a managed wireless network without notification of and or permission from the manager of that network. The network manager may wish to locate such a rogue device in order to determine if it should be turned off disabled reconfigured etc. Similarly the network manager may wish to find the physical location of a previously unknown wireless device that begins operation within the managed wireless network. The operation of such rogue devices may compromise the overall security and or performance of the wireless network.

In some existing systems a significant number of probe wireless devices must be installed at known positions within the wireless network in order to help a network manager determine the physical locations of all wireless devices. Such probe devices are costly and the added cost to the overall network costs may be substantial. Moreover such probe devices are incapable of simultaneously acting as probes and access points or station devices.

For the above reasons and others it would be desirable to have a new system for determining the physical location of a wireless network device. The new system should be convenient and intuitive for use by a system manager and not require the use of dedicated probe devices.

To address the above described and other shortcomings of existing systems a method and system for determining and representing one or more potential locations of a newly detected wireless network device. The disclosed system first detects a wireless device which may be either an access point or a station by receiving transmissions from that device at one or more devices that are currently within the wireless network being managed. A graphic representation of the newly detected device is then provided in a predetermined region of a user interface external to another region of the user interface containing a representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed. The system then enables the user to select a number of known access points within the wireless network from which an estimated distance to the newly detected device is to be determined and represented. A representation is then generated of an estimated distance from each one of the selected number of access points such as those access points that are estimated to be physically closest to the newly detected device. The estimations of distance between the newly detected device and the known access points may be made on the basis of signal strength with regard to transmissions from the newly detected device received at the known access points.

The representation of distance from each of the known access points to the newly added device may be provided using a substantially circular ring referred to herein for purposes of explanation as a distance ring surrounding each of the known access points. The distance rings are displayed in the region of the user interface containing a representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed. The distance rings may be displayed surrounding icon representations of the known access points previously positioned over the representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed such that they correspond to physical locations of the known devices they represent.

After display of the distance rings a user may observe one or more distance ring intersections. The distance ring intersections indicate one or more potential positions within the physical environment at which the newly detected device may be located. If the user desires more distance rings to be displayed they can increase the number of known access points for which distance rings are to be generated. Similarly if the number of distance rings being displayed is too great the user can decrease the number of selected known access points.

Using the distance ring intersections the user can then investigate the corresponding likely positions of the new device within the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed. The user may then for example following sufficient confirmation of the new device s actual physical position move the graphic representation of the new device into the region of the user interface in which a representation of the wireless network s physical environment is displayed. Alternatively a network manager may wish to disable or remove the new device in order to eliminate potential or actual any adverse security or performance impact on the network.

In one embodiment the distance rings may be displayed simultaneously with power range rings representing radio coverage ranges of the access point devices corresponding to the access point representations at their centers. In such a case the distance rings are generated in a visually distinct manner with respect to the power range rings. For example the width of the distance rings may be used to visually distinguish them from the power range rings i.e. the distance rings may be substantially thicker than the power range rings.

Thus there is disclosed a new system for determining the physical location of a wireless network device. The disclosed system is advantageously convenient and intuitive for use by a system manager and does not require the use of dedicated probe devices.

As shown in an illustrative embodiment of the disclosed system includes a wireless communication network management software program and a separate drawing software program executing on a management station . The management station may for example consist of any specific type of computer system including one or more processors operable to execute program code stored in a computer program memory or other type of computer program storage device and having a number of input output devices and interfaces. The management station is communicably coupled to a wired network which in turn is coupled to a number of wireless access point devices shown for purposes of illustration as access points AP A AP B and AP C. The access point devices provide wireless access to the wired network to client station devices . The client station devices are shown for purposes of illustration as client stations CS A CS B CS C CS D and CS E. The access point devices and the client station devices are shown within a wireless communication network . The wireless communication network is accessible to and managed by the wireless communication network management program . The management station and each of the access point devices and client station devices shown in include hardware firmware and or software implemented functionality enabling them to communicate using one or more networking protocols to exchange information such as messages or packets.

During operation of the embodiment shown in the wireless communication network management program uses graphical user interface software GUI SW to provide a user interface output . The output includes a graphical representation of the radio frequency domain characteristics of one or more devices in the wireless communication network in combination with a graphical representation of the physical space in which the wireless communication network is deployed. In order to generate the output the wireless communication network management program communicates with the drawing program through an application programming interface API . For example display objects commands and or other data may be communicated between the wireless communication network management program and the drawing program . An electronic computer readable representation of the physical space such as a data file or other type of electronic document is stored by or within the drawing program . In an illustrative embodiment the drawing program consists of a copy of the Visio drawing program provided by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash.

At step the disclosed system operates to discover the access point and client station devices in the wireless communication network being managed. For example the wireless communication network may be associated with a predetermined subnet mask and that subnet mask may be used to discover devices on the wireless network that match the subnet mask. Such wireless network device discovery may be performed using techniques such as the PING Packet Internet Groper utility which check for all responding device IP Internet Protocol addresses corresponding to the predetermined subnet mask. In addition the Address Resolution Protocol ARP may for example then be used for translating IP addresses into the 6 byte Ethernet addresses of the discovered devices.

After the disclosed system has discovered a device on the wireless communication network a request message such as an SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol request message is sent to that device to determine whether the device is manageable by the wireless communication network management program of . Devices that return a positive response are sent further request messages to determine characteristics and settings of the devices. Such characteristics and settings may be obtained for example through values stored in the Management Information Base MIB of the devices and include indications of characteristics and settings such as transmit power settings and lists of associated client stations for access points.

At step the disclosed system operates to combine representations of the radio frequency domain characteristics of the wireless network devices with the physical space representation. As a result the radio frequency domain characteristics of the wireless network devices may be conveniently indicated to the user within the context of and at the same scale as the physical space representation. For example the disclosed system may operate by creating one or more wireless device radio frequency domain representations in one or more graphical layers defined using the drawing program that may be superimposed over the physical space representation in a user interface display.

The wireless communication network management program subsequently operates to periodically send further request messages to the access point devices discovered in step in order to monitor their radio frequency domain characteristics and settings such as current transmit power settings and associated client station lists. Any changes detected using these requests may then be used to modify radio frequency domain representations of the wireless network devices that are layered over the physical space representation in the user interface.

As shown in access point representation has an associated power range ring . The multi band access point representation represents a single corresponding access point device having multiple radio frequency band capabilities and includes conjoined access point representations and each having the same visual appearance as representations of single radio frequency band capable access point devices. For example the access point representation may represent the IEEE 802.11a radio frequency band circuitry within the multi band access point device corresponding to the graphical representation and the access point representation may represent the IEEE 802.11g radio frequency band circuitry within the multi band access point device corresponding to the graphical representation .

The conjoined access point representations and each have respective associated power range rings and . The areas within the power range rings and represent radio coverage ranges of the access point devices corresponding to the access point representations at their centers. The greater the diameter of a power range ring the larger the area of the radio coverage range it represents.

The thickness of each of the power range rings and represents the potential bandwidth that can be provided by the associated access point devices to client stations located within them. A thicker power range ring indicates a relatively larger amount of available bandwidth for client stations located within the area defined by the ring while a thinner power range ring indicates a relatively lower amount of available bandwidth for client stations located within the area defined by the ring. The appearances of the access point representations and associated power range rings are further indicative of the radio frequency channels on which the corresponding access point devices are currently operating. For example the access point representation may be displayed in a first predetermined color associated with a corresponding radio frequency channel indicating that the corresponding access point device is operating within that radio frequency channel.

Similarly since the multi band access point representation may correspond to a dual mode access point device thus including two independent sets of radio circuitry each of which can independently operate using a separate radio frequency band. Accordingly each of the conjoined access point representations and and their associated power range rings may be represented to visually indicate the respective colors associated respectively with two different radio frequency channels that currently being used by the corresponding access point.

Each access point representation may further include textual information. For example the access point representation includes text indicating the specific channel that the corresponding access point device is currently operating on text indicating the wireless LAN protocol used a for 802.11a by the corresponding access point device and the last three characters of the MAC Media Access Control address of the corresponding access point.

The specific appearance such as diameter width color and textual information for each access point representation and associated power range ring may be determined in part response to configuration and setting information determined from the corresponding devices for example by way of SNMP requests for MIB values stored in the devices. Such configuration information may include the type of wireless communication protocol supported and or enabled in the device such as one of the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b or 802.11g protocols. The configuration and setting information determined from the devices may also include a current transmit power setting for the device current channel or other information that may be used to determine the appearance of the access point representations and power range rings. User provided information may also or alternatively be used to determine in part or completely how the access point representations and power range rings are represented as described below with reference to .

The association lines provided between the client station and access point representations of are formatted to visually indicate the amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding access point and client station devices as well as the currently selected radio frequency channel being used to communicate between the devices. For example the width of an association line may be used to indicate the amount of available bandwidth between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations connected by the association line. In such an embodiment a relatively thick association line may be used to represent a relatively large amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding devices while a relatively thin association line may be used to represent a relatively small amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding devices. Similarly the format of the association lines in may be used to visually indicate a current radio frequency channel being used to communicate between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations the connect. For example the color of the association lines may indicate which radio frequency channel is currently being used to communicate between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations they connect. Other association line format characteristics may alternatively be used to visually distinguish between higher and lower amounts of available bandwidth between corresponding devices and or between radio frequency channels currently being used to communicate between the corresponding devices.

At step the disclosed system operates to reposition the client station representations from the client station display region to the physical space display region. The repositioning performed at step may for example be performed responsive to a user clicking and dragging the client station representations from the client station display region into the physical space display region. Alternatively the repositioning at step may be automatically performed by the disclosed system based on a number of auto positioning parameters such as distance from associated access point representation. The association lines generated at step are maintained between the representations of associated devices in the repositioning provided at step .

2 Known Access Points other access point devices that can be heard by the access point device for example on the selected channel shown in and or some other channel.

In the example of the list box shows characteristics of a number of listed associated client stations. The columns shown in the list box are shown for example including the following information for each client station associated with the access point 

Channel The channel that the associated client station is currently using for transmits and receives 

WLAN Mode an indication of the wireless protocol in user for example a indicates that the 802.11a is in use by the associated client station and

Path Lost The amount dB of radio signal lost between the associated client station and the access point.

The association lines and between the access point and client station representations indicate amounts of available bandwidth between the corresponding associated wireless devices. For example the thickness of the association line indicates by its relative thickness the available bandwidth between the access point device corresponding to the access point representation and the client station device corresponding to the client station representation . The association line similarly indicates the available bandwidth between the access point device corresponding to the access point representation and the client station device corresponding the client station representation . Also the thickness of the association line indicates the available bandwidth between the access point device corresponding to the access point representation and the client station device corresponding to the client station representation . Accordingly as visually indicated by the relative thickness of the association line versus the relative thinness of the association lines and the client stations corresponding to the client station representation has a relatively larger amount of bandwidth available for communication with the access point device corresponding to the access point representation than the client station devices corresponding to the client station representations and have with the access point device corresponding to the access point representation . The colors of the access point representations power range rings and client station representations may be used to indicate the current radio frequency channels being used to communicate between the corresponding wireless devices.

The client station representation in indicates for example by way of a number of padlock graphics on it that the user has indicated that it should be excluded from auto positioning. Accordingly if an auto positioning function is invoked by the user the client station representation will not be moved from its current position in the display.

When a user selects the icon display tab shown in an icon interface display window is generated as shown in . The icon interface display window enables a user to indicate various visual aspects of the user interface display with regard to the device representations and association lines. The address display buttons enable the user to indicate whether some portion of the MAC or IP address of a device should be shown in a text portion of its graphical representation. The automatic client station placement button enables a user to indicate that representations of client stations should be automatically placed in physical proximity to the representations of the access point devices with which they are associated. The channel representation buttons enable a user to indicate how radio frequency channels currently in use should be represented in the device representations power range rings and association lines. For example different radio channels may be distinctly represented by respective ones of a set of CRT colors respective ones of a set of LCD colors or by corresponding line formats in black and white patterns. The association line thickness check box enables a user to indicate whether the thickness of association lines should be used to represent the relative amount of available bandwidth between associated devices. The association line thickness value field enables a user to indicate an association line thickness to be used if the association line thickness is not to be used to represent available bandwidth between associated devices. The power range ring thickness check box enables a user to indicate whether the thickness of displayed power range rings is to be used to indicate the amount of bandwidth available to client station devices within them. Similarly the power range ring thickness value field enables a user to indicate a power range ring thickness to be used if the power range ring thickness is not to be used to represent available bandwidth within the power range rings.

The power Halo check box enables a user to indicate an additional visual characteristic such as a shaded area referred to as a halo should be used with access point representations. For example the disclosed system may be embodied to include a colored shading over a circular area around an access point representation whenever the corresponding access point device is operable. Such a shading may resemble a colored cloud of the same color as used to represent the current radio frequency channel that the device is currently operating on. If the halo visual characteristic is enabled the user may further indicate the diameter of the shaded area to be used in the field .

The field enables a user to indicate a distance at which client station representations are to be placed when they are automatically placed near the representations of access point devices with which the corresponding client station devices are associated. The check box enables a user to indicate whether association lines are to be presented between the representations of associated devices and the check box enables the user to indicate whether power range rings are to be provided around representations of client stations.

The selected radio button from the column determines the diameter and thickness of the power range rings. A relatively small selected transmit power value in column results in relatively smaller diameter power range rings while a relatively large selected transmit power value in column results in relatively larger diameter power range rings. This reflects the fact that a higher transmit power enables the radio signals from the wireless devices associated with the power range rings to carry greater amounts of data over greater distances. Accordingly the disclosed system determines a diameter for each power range ring that corresponds to the distance in the physical space representation based on scale information provided by the user that would reflect the throughputs shown for the corresponding transmit power in the selected row. For example if the radio button for 64 dBm were selected and a device is being represented that uses IEEE 802.11b technology the disclosed system generates power range rings having a diameter equal to the distance in the scale of the physical space representation that could be traversed using a transmit power of 64 DBm and providing a maximum throughput of 11 megabits per second using the IEEE 802.11b protocol. If the device being represented is an IEEE 802.11a or 802.11g device the generated ring would have a diameter equal to the distance in the scale of the physical space representation that could be traversed using a transmit power of 64 DBm and providing a maximum throughput of 54 megabits per second using the IEEE 802.11a or 802.11g protocols.

Similarly the thickness of each power range ring decreases as the power range ring diameter increases reflecting a smaller amount of available bandwidth within the area of the physical space representation within the power range ring. Accordingly the values in columns and increase as the amount of transmit power in column increases. For example if the radio button in column corresponding to 64 dBm is selected the generated power range rings would have a relatively smaller thickness indicative of 11 megabits per second for IEEE 802.11b protocol devices and a relatively greater thickness indicative of 54 megabits per second for IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11g protocol devices. Thus the thickness of each power range ring may be responsive to a user selected amount of radio signal attenuation and reflects the distance in the physical space representation corresponding to the diameter of the power range ring and the type of communication protocol used by the associated wireless device. The user may also select the bottom of the six radio button in the column and then enter a value in dBm from 25 to 99 in the adjacent box. The disclosed system then fills in the appropriate available bandwidths for the provided transmit power value for the columns and .

The newly detected device is initially represented graphically by an icon representation for example in either the first display region in for showing graphical representations of discovered access point devices or the second display region in for showing representations of client station devices. This representation of the newly detected device will indicate a wireless communication channel on which the device has been heard by one or more previously deployed known access point devices in the wireless network for example using a predetermined color or other visual indication associated with the channel.

At step the disclosed system generates an interface that allows a user to indicated the number of known access point devices for which distance rings are to be displayed. The disclosed system selects the known access points that are receiving the strongest transmissions from the newly detected device up to the number input at step from the interface displayed at step and generates distance rings for representations of those known access points at step . The distance rings generated at step may for example be overlaid on top of a representation of the physical environment of the wireless network. The diameter of the distance rings generated at step indicates an estimated distance from the associated access point at which the newly detected wireless device is located. The estimated distance may for example be determined based on measured signal strengths of one or more transmissions from the newly detected wireless device received by the known access points associated with the respective distance rings.

It will be recognized that even if a newly detected device is not manageable with network management software used to manage the deployed wireless communication network it will still be heard by previously deployed access points which will be able to report the channel on which the device is transmitting to the management system.

As shown in the portion of user interface display includes a representation of the physical environment in which the wireless communication is deployed. Thus a user can determine potential physical locations of the newly discovered device from where the distance ring is displayed over the representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed.

A power range ring is further shown in for the access point device corresponding to the access point representation . A dotted line is shown connecting the access point representation with the detected wireless device representation . The detected wireless device representation has been moved for example by way of a user dragging and dropping it from its initial display within the access point display region where it initially was displayed when it was discovered. In the example of the detected wireless device representation corresponds to a dual mode access point device thus including two independent sets of radio circuitry each of which can independently operate using a separate radio frequency band. Accordingly one of the conjoined access point representations is shown having an associated power range ring . The communication channel on which the known access point has received transmissions from the newly detected wireless device may be displayed for example using the color of the distance ring . Another representation of a dual mode access point is shown also including two conjoined access point representations one of which is indicated with a power range ring .

Those skilled in the art will recognize that the physical characteristics of the execution environment for the wireless communication network being managed may have an impact on the likely physical locations of newly discovered devices provided by the disclosed system. Accordingly a skilled user may take into account certain physical characteristics of the physical environment such as walls which may introduce some amount of inaccuracy to distance determinations based on received power levels as may be used in some embodiments of the disclosed system.

The specific graphical representations of devices shown in the present Figures are given purely for purposes of illustration and the present invention may be embodied using other specific shapes line formats colors or designs. For example access point representations need not be represented using octagons and client station representations need not be represented using squares other specific shapes may be used as appropriate for a given embodiment. Similarly line thickness of the power range rings is just one example of how potential bandwidth may be represented and other line formats may be used to visually represent the potential bandwidth available within the power range rings. Additionally line thickness is just one example of how distance rings may be presented in a way that is visually distinct from the graphic displays for power range rings. Moreover while the color of access point power range ring distance and client station representations is used in the exemplary embodiments to distinguish between different channels currently in use by the corresponding wireless devices other visual characteristics of such representations may alternatively be used to represent channel selection.
