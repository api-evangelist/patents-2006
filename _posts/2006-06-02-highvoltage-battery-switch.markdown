The invention is a Continuation in Part of claims priority to and incorporates by reference in its entirety U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 457 698 filed May 16 2003 titled Battery Mechanism to Joseph F. Sharrow Kurt W. Solomon Frank E. Peterkin Jack S. Bernandes and Brian J. Hankla and assigned Navy Case 832237.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to the battery mechanisms and more particularly to such mechanisms that preferably can safely reliably and remotely combine multiple battery assemblies.

High powered electrical devices at least occasionally require portable operation. This means that the devices must be able to be used off battery power. Such high powered electrical devices include those used in pulsed power systems which may find applicability in both military and non military scenarios.

The high voltage needed to power the electrical devices means that battery packs which power such electrical devices must themselves be able to provide high voltage. Such high voltage battery packs are inherently dangerous however. Incorrect installation or assembly of the battery packs or defective battery packs can potentially severely injure personnel or even cause fatalities.

Conventional battery assemblies yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide a battery assembly for safe and controllable electrical concatenation in series. The battery assembly includes a plurality of battery packs a switch a receiver and an actuator.

In various exemplary embodiments provide for each battery pack to include a plurality of rechargeable battery cells electrically connected in series. The switch electrically connects and disconnects first and second battery packs of the plurality together. The receiver transmits power from the switch. The actuator operates the switch to connect and disconnect the battery packs.

In preferred embodiments the switch includes first and second buses and a deflector. The first bus electrically contacts the first battery pack. The second bus electrically contacts the second battery pack. The deflector moves the first bus to electrically connect and disconnect with the second bus in response to communication with the actuator.

An electrical connector is further provided for mechanical engagement and disengagement of electrical conduction to a terminal. The connector includes a block and a plurality of contacts. The block includes a plurality of openings. Each contact is disposed into a corresponding opening in the block.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

Conventional battery power switching mechanisms lack capabilities of scalable connectivity with multiple battery cell packs that provide reasonable levels of safety for personnel for installation and other pre activation operations. Various exemplary embodiments address these limitations.

A battery assembly including a pair of battery units is illustrated in isometric view in shown from port left and starboard right sides respectively of the front battery unit s perspective as illustrated with a compass rose. Each battery unit includes a pair of cell section packs shown in disposed at top and bottom. Except for orientation in relation to the drawings the front and rear battery units may be identical.

The illustrated configurations show the battery assembly having the pair of fore and aft back to back pairs of battery units . The configuration of each displayed battery unit provides the pair of top and bottom section packs . As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill the embodiments illustrated and described in detail herein are exemplary only and do not limit the scope of the invention.

The battery assembly may include an aluminum Al enclosure that mechanically couples the battery units back to back. The battery units may include a complementary pair of enclosure plates for the respective port and starboard sides.

The enclosure may include a pair of mounting elbows for installation and a pair of handles one each on the port and starboard sides. Each enclosure plate may incorporate a plurality of portholes thereon.

An aluminum cover plate may protect the section pack on its fore side. The cover plate may include windows that show portions of battery subpacks described further herein infra.

The central enclosure includes an outer plate at top and bottom ends of the battery unit and a central support . Parallel rails may be aligned fore and aft along the plate and the support to guide and maintain subpack assemblies disposed therebetween. Each plate may further include a slot key to orient the subpack assemblies for insertion.

Consequently the subpack assemblies may be disposed in linear groupings as shown in these exemplary embodiments to facilitate controllable connectivity as well as to minimize encumbered volume. However as artisans of ordinary skill will be aware other arrangements may be contemplated without departing from the scope of the claims. Each subpack assembly contains a plurality of battery cells as described in further detail herein infra.

A plastic tray contains electrical power storage components described in further detail herein. The tray includes a fore wall an aft wall a bottom inboard wall and a top outboard wall . A portion of the fore wall may be observed through the window in . The safety cover may slide from the bottom side and latches to the fuse cover .

The top wall may include a groove that aligns with the slot key on the outer plate for inserting the subpack assembly into the section pack . The aft wall may include terminals and a blade type fuse beneath the fuse cover . Each subpack is readily removable from the section pack for recharging at a separate equipment station.

The tray may contain a plurality of rechargeable nickel cadmium NiCd cells for storing electrical energy. The cells may be arranged in a 5 7 rectangular planar array as shown. These thirty five cells may be connected in series to concatenate their individual voltage contributions for greater power than available from a single cell. Each cell may provide 1.25 V volts direct current for a total of 43.75 Vavailable from each subpack assembly .

The switch assembly incorporates a base and a housing . A cover plate protects internal components contained within the housing . Support posts contribute structural integrity to the housing along the longitudinal sides and provide continuation of the rails .

A plurality of cams with six shown in the exemplary configuration may be disposed to rotate with the shaft . Counterpart pluralities of beryllium copper BeCu leaf springs and brass busbars may be disposed adjacently outward top and bottom from the corresponding cams within the housing .

Returning to a plurality of spring connectors may be disposed along the base along the port starboard axis and neighboring the port end of the housing . Except for their respective positions and orientations the connectors may all be identical to each other.

A positive and negative pair of connectors may correspond to the each of four subpack assemblies forming a quad in the top section pack as shown on the base . A complementary pair of connectors may similarly be distributed for a subpack quad in the bottom section pack but are obscured in by the housing .

From the base at the starboard end of the shown portion one of the springs extends towards the top and may flex along the top to bottom direction. In the exemplary embodiments described the busbar may be comparatively stiffer than the spring . The spring may be partially shrouded by a leaf spring mount connected to the base .

Beyond the mount the spring bends towards the fore end extending beyond one of the cams and a helical spring or coil . The spring may be interposed between the cam and the connector disposed on the busbar . The coil may extend towards the top shrouded by a hollow cylinder connected to the housing .

Also from the base at the port end of the shown portion one of the busbars extends from its lower portion towards the top. This busbar bends towards the fore end and then extends towards starboard with one of the connectors disposed at the busbar s free end at its upper portion .

The spring and the busbar may each be connected to one of the base s pair of connectors as shown in . The spring and busbar may represent complementary connections engaged and disengaged concurrently with each other by the rotating position of the cam .

Each combination of corresponding cam spring and busbar whether along the bottom or top sides of the housing may produce a switch to connect adjacent subpack assemblies in electrical communication with the corresponding pair of connectors on the base . The cams may be aligned to connect selected groups of or all of the cell assemblies together.

The cam depicted in have a pair of opposing radial extensions or lobes. However this configuration is exemplary only and other configurations can be envisioned within the scope of the claims. The cams along the shaft may have sundry configurations depending on the fraction of the subpack assemblies to be electrically connected together.

For example a first cam may have one or more first lobes that align with a one or more second lobes on a second cam so that both sets of lobes engage their counterpart springs concurrently to concatenate power from a combined set of battery subpacks . Alternatively the first cam may have one or more third lobes that do not align with one or more fourth lobes on the second cam to combine power from only a select portion of connected battery subpacks .

The secondary and tertiary busbars connect the remainder of the switching circuit in the switch assembly . Thus the shaft may be rotated through the keyhole or the pneumatic actuator to open or close the switch assembly s circuit on command. Turning the cam to connect and disconnect the springs with the busbar s connector respectively closes and opens the switching circuit.

The underside of the block includes a pair of pegs at the underside ends for insertion into mounting holes of the busbar . Persons having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the pattern and number of pins within the block are exemplary only and that other configurations may be contemplated without departing from the scope of the invention.

This model probe for the pin has a gold plated nickel silver Ni Ag barrel a stainless steel spring and a gold plated beryllium copper plunger having a diameter of 0.045 inch and a travel length of 0.060 inch. The plunger may be deflected along its longitudinal axis for compression into the barrel to compensate proximate distance variations between components within mechanical tolerance. Its performance characteristics include operation at 3 A amps continuous with 10 A intermittent peaks and maximum resistance of 50 m . Assembled into the connector the six pins may channel current intermittently at about 40 A.

A panel on the reverse side of and more apparent in faces towards the fore end of the front battery unit . A top cover and an aluminum enclosure shroud the conditioner s interior components. A pair of brass contacts protrudes towards the fore direction opposite the panel and is insulated from the enclosure by plastic inserts.

An opposite panel that faces towards starboard partially encloses the electronics . A signal from the opposite panel may be transmitted through the electronics and the relay to provide power through the terminals on the external face . The signal may also be employed to modulate a proportion of the total available power.

The switch assembly operates to electrically connect the subpack assemblies within each section pack in both battery units of the battery assembly . The combined electrical power from the subpack assemblies may be channeled through the power conditioner .

As described supra each subpack assembly with thirty five cells connected together in series can provide 43.75 V. Installed together within their respective section pack the subpack assemblies transmit no power unless the switch assembly is engaged. The connectors provide convenient and reliable distributed electrical conduits for channeling electrical power from the subpack assemblies .

Concatenated together by the switch assembly each battery unit can provide 350 V. Consequently the combined battery assembly with a pair of switch assemblies for their corresponding battery units may provide 700 Vsafely and on command.

Electrical connection of the battery unit may be commanded for activation or deactivation by a signal submitted to the pneumatic actuator . Manual override of such a command may be performed through the keyhole using an appropriate tool.

The materials disclosed for particular components represent practical representative substances having appropriate structural electrical thermal and or chemical properties for the applicable function. Artisans of ordinary skill will recognize that alternate materials may be selected for these components as optional design choices without any claim scope departure.

In general while certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
