Network type game systems in each of which a server controls operations of a plurality of game devices connected via a network have been widely used. In a game realized by such a game system a professional wrestler registered with an entity managed by a player who operates a game device plays a match against another professional wrestler registered with another entity managed by another player who operates another game device as described in Battle Climax Monthly Arcadia Magazine June Serial No. 49 Japan Enterbrain Inc. Jun. 1 2004 Vol. 5 No. 6 Serial No. 49 pp. 24 31.

This game system uses wrestler cards for executing games. On a wrestler card information is recorded about a wrestler as a character game character that will be used in games. A wrestler card is necessary for a player to register the wrestler recorded on the wrestler card with an entity of the player by operating a game device. Accordingly if a player has more various types of wrestler cards the player can select preferred wrestlers from among various wrestlers and register the wrestler with the player s entity and therefore a greater diversity of choices is available. By virtue of this worth wrestler cards are regarded as collectibles. The game system provider has been preparing several hundred wrestler cards. The wrestler cards can be treated as trading cards that can be exchanged among players. This feature is an important factor for enriching a fascinating aspect of games.

In a game in this game system each player designates a wrestler from among a plurality of wrestlers registered with the player s entity and then the designated wrestlers play a match against each other. When a player registers the wrestler recorded on a wrestler card with the player s entity the same wrester can already have been registered with one or more entities managed by other players since a plurality of players can take possession of the same type of wrestler card. In particular each popular wrestler will be registered multiple times with a plurality of entities managed by different players. Therefore it is possible that a wrestler will play a match against the same wrestler.

However a match between different wrestlers is more interesting than a match between wrestlers with the same characteristics. The original purpose of providing variable wrestler cards is to give players a greater diversity of choices and to provide a wide variety of matchups. In a conventional game system the registration ratio of wrestlers is very biased and therefore there is a high probability that wrestlers with the same characteristics will play a match against each other.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a game system in which each player uses game characters registered with the player s entity for playing games and in which usage ratios of game characters are not significantly biased.

In the following a description will be given of the present invention. It should be noted that reference numerals in the attached drawings are shown in parenthesis to facilitate understanding of the present invention and not to limit the present invention to embodiments as shown in the drawings.

In order to solve the above described problem a game system according to the present invention includes a server device and a plurality of game devices A B communicable with the server device in which each of the game devices registers at least one game character from among a plurality of prepared game characters with an entity managed in a virtual space by a player engages in a competition with another of the game devices using a game character that is specified by a player from among said at least one registered game character and computes based on details of a competition an amount of a virtual fund possessed by an entity. The server device includes an individual information memory part TBL that stores an identifier identifying a player and an individual information set including character information specifying at least one game character registered by the player with an entity that the player manages and fund information indicating an amount of a virtual fund possessed by the entity the identifier and the individual information set being stored in association with each other an individual information acquisition replier that upon receiving from one of the game devices A B an individual information acquisition request containing an identifier of a player acquires from the individual information memory part TBL an individual information set corresponding to the received identifier and transmits to the game device A B having transmitted the individual information acquisition request an individual information acquisition response containing the acquired individual information set an individual information updater that upon receiving from one of the game devices A B an individual information update request containing an identifier and an updated individual information set updates an individual information set stored in association with the received identifier in the individual information memory part TBL by replacing the stored individual information set with the updated individual information set a degree of popularity computer S S that computes a degree of popularity for each of the prepared game characters the degree of popularity relating to the number of entities with which each game character is registered the computation being performed by referring to contents stored in the individual information memory part TBL a registration fee determiner S that generates based on the degree of popularity computed by the degree of popularity computer S S registration fee information for each of the prepared game characters the registration fee information indicating a registration fee in virtual money necessary for registering each game character with an entity and a registration fee information deliverer that delivers to the game devices A B registration fee information for each game character determined by the registration fee determiner S . Each of the game devices A B includes a first reader that reads from a first information recording medium storing an identifier identifying a player the identifier a second reader that reads from a second information recording medium storing character information specifying a game character the character information an input unit that receives an input instruction from a player a first storage device that stores registration fee information for each of the prepared game characters received from the server device an individual information acquisition requester S S that transmits before a game to the server device an individual information acquisition request containing the identifier and requesting for an individual information set corresponding to the identifier the individual information acquisition requester receiving from the server device an individual information acquisition response containing the individual information set a second storage device that stores the individual information set received by the individual information acquisition requester S S a first updater S that updates after finishing a game based on details of the game fund information of the individual information set stored in the second storage device a comparer S that upon reading the character information by the second reader reads from the first storage device registration fee information for the game character corresponding to the character information read by the second reader and compares a current amount of the virtual fund indicated by the fund information to a registration fee indicated by the registration fee information for the game character a registration permitter that permits registration of the game character to an entity managed by a player identified by the identifier in a case in which a result of the comparison by the comparer S shows that the current amount of the virtual fund is equal to or greater than the registration fee a second updater S that upon permission of registration of the game character by the registration permitter obtains new fund information by deducting the registration fee for the game character from the current amount of the virtual fund and updates the individual information set stored in the second storage device so as to contain the new fund information and the character information of the registered game character and an individual information update requester S that generates upon updating the individual information set by at least one of the first and second updaters an individual information update request containing the updated individual information set and the identifier the individual information update requester transmitting the individual information update request to the server device .

In a game in which the present invention is applied game characters available for competitions by a player are limited to game characters registered with the player s entity. However if a player pays a registration fee fee necessary for players to newly employ a game character for playing the game of a game character the game character may be registered with the player s entity so that a plurality of players may register the same game character with the players entities. When the number of game characters that can be registered with one entity is limited popular game characters may be exclusively registered in comparison with a case in which the number of registrable game character is not limited. If the same game character is registered with a plurality of entities game characters of the same characteristics play a match with each other but this is not interesting in comparison with a matchup between different game characters. According to the present invention registration fees are changed depending on the degrees of popularity of game characters. Registration fees will be raised for game characters having a higher degree of popularity whereas registration fees will be lowered for game characters having a lower degree of popularity. Therefore convergence of registrations of some of the game characters can be prevented and various game characters can be registered with different entities. Accordingly the worth of each second information recording medium the wrestler cards in the embodiments storing character information which is conventionally fixed can be changed so that the amusement factor can be broadly improved in the overall game system.

Virtual money in the present application is a standard of value of exchange that is effective within this game. Paying a registration fee from a player s virtual fund allows the player s entity to register a game character. Players who participate in the game are expected to compete in virtual box office income and current total fund new fund through the game. However players may compete in other kinds of privileges for example points titles or privileged orbs that players may obtain. Virtual funds may be used to obtain such privileges. Obtained privileges may be exchanged for game elements for example game characters . If obtained privileges may be exchanged for game elements the privileges may be included in virtual money since they are standards of value of exchange.

In the game system preferably the registration fee determiner S executes a first process of computing a deviation of a degree of popularity for each prepared game character from an average degree of popularity of the plurality of prepared game characters and a second process of determining the registration fee for each prepared game character by increasing or decreasing a value of a standard registration fee by a value corresponding to the deviation. In this case registration fees can be determined by increasing or decreasing a value of a standard registration fee depending on degree of popularity. The value of the standard may be common to a plurality of game characters or may be individually determined for each game character. For example when offensive capability and defensive capability differ depending on an individual game character it is preferable to determine the value of the standard individually for each game character. Registration fees will be set higher for capable game characters for impeding registration so that it is possible to enhance the rarity value of the second information recording medium storing the character information indicating such a game character.

Furthermore in the game system it is preferable that each game device A B further include a dispensing mechanism for dispensing a new second information recording medium when a game has been finished. In the second process the registration fee determiner S determines the registration fee for at least a part part or all of the prepared game characters by increasing or decreasing a value of a standard registration fee on the basis of the deviation and an incidence probability of each game character showing a probability that a game character indicated by the game character information recorded on the new second information recording medium dispensed from the dispensing mechanism is the corresponding game character. Registration of a game character with a player s entity requires obtaining a second information recording medium by the player. Second information recording media are dispensed from a game device when games are finished. On a second information recording medium character information indicating a game character uniquely is stored. A plurality of game characters on second information recording media have different incidence probabilities. The incidence probability is the ratio of the number of issued second information recording medium of a type of game character to the total number of all second information recording media issued by the game provider. In other words the incidence probability of each game character is a probability that a second information recording medium dispensed from the dispensing mechanism at the finish of a game is the second information recording medium recording the corresponding type of game character. A game character with a lower incidence probability among the second information recording media has a lower probability of being registered. On the other hand a game character with a higher incidence probability has a higher probability of being registered. If the registration fee of a game character having a lower incidence probability is expensive the probability of the game character being registered will be reduced more so that the registration fee of the game character will be more expensive. By referring to not only degrees of popularity but also incidence probabilities registration fees are determined in a coordinated way.

Another game system according to the present invention includes a server device and a plurality of game devices A B communicable with the server device in which each of the game devices registers at least one game character from among a plurality of prepared game characters with an entity managed in a virtual space by a player engages in a competition with another of the game devices using a game character that is specified by a player from among said at least one registered game character and computes based on details of a competition an amount of a virtual fund possessed by an entity. The server device includes an individual information memory part TBL that stores an identifier identifying a player and an individual information set including character information specifying at least one game character registered by the player with an entity that the player manages and fund information indicating an amount of a virtual fund possessed by the entity the identifier and the individual information set being stored in association with each other an individual information acquisition replier that upon receiving from one of the game devices A B an individual information acquisition request containing an identifier of a player acquires from the individual information memory part TBL an individual information set corresponding to the received identifier and transmits to the game device A B having transmitted the individual information acquisition request an individual information acquisition response containing the acquired individual information set an individual information updater that upon receiving from one of the game devices A B an individual information update request containing an identifier and an updated individual information set updates an individual information set stored in association with the received identifier in the individual information memory part TBL by replacing the stored individual information set with the updated individual information set a usage ratio computer that computes for each of the prepared game characters a usage ratio indicating frequency of each game character having been used for competitions based on specific information received from the game devices the specific information specifying a game character used in a competition at each game device a registration fee determiner S that generates based on the usage ratio computed by the usage ratio computer registration fee information for each of the prepared game characters the registration fee information indicating a registration fee in imaginary money necessary for registering each game character with an entity and a registration fee information deliverer that delivers to the game devices A B registration fee information for each game character determined by the registration fee determiner S . Each of the game devices includes a first reader that reads from a first information recording medium storing an identifier identifying a player the identifier a second reader that reads from a second information recording medium storing character information specifying a game character the character information an input unit that receives an input instruction from a player a first storage device that stores registration fee information for each of the prepared game characters received from the server device an individual information acquisition requester S S that transmits before a game to the server device an individual information acquisition request containing the identifier and requesting for an individual information set corresponding to the identifier the individual information acquisition requester receiving from the server device an individual information acquisition response containing the individual information set a second storage device that stores the individual information set received by the individual information acquisition requester S S a first updater S that updates after finishing a game based on details of the game fund information of the individual information set stored in the second storage device a comparer S that upon reading the character information by the second reader reads from the first storage device registration fee information for the game character corresponding to the character information read by the second reader and compares a current amount of the virtual fund indicated by the fund information to a registration fee indicated by the registration fee information for the game character a registration permitter that permits registration of the game character to an entity managed by a player identified by the identifier in a case in which a result of the comparison by the comparer S shows that the current amount of the virtual fund is equal to or greater than the registration fee a second updater S that upon permission of registration of the game character by the registration permitter obtains new fund information by deducting the registration fee for the game character from the current amount of the virtual fund and updates the individual information set stored in the second storage device so as to contain the new fund information and the character information of the registered game character a specific information generator that generates specific information specifying a game character used in a competition at the game device an individual information update requester S that generates upon updating the individual information set by at least one of the first and second updaters an individual information update request containing the updated individual information set and the identifier the individual information update requester transmitting the individual information update request to the server device and a specific information transmitter that transmits the specific information generated by the specific information generator to the server device.

In accordance with the present invention registration fees are changed depending on usage ratios of game characters used in competitions. Registration fees will be raised for game characters having a higher usage ratio while registration fees will be lowered for game characters having a lower usage ratio. Therefore convergence of registrations of a part of game characters can be prevented and various game characters can be registered with different entities. Accordingly the worth of each second information recording medium wrestler card in the embodiments storing character information which is conventionally fixed can be changed so that the amusement factor can be broadly improved in the overall game system.

In the game system preferably the registration fee determiner S executes a first process of computing a deviation of a usage ratio for each prepared game character from an average usage ratio of the plurality of prepared game characters and a second process of determining the registration fee for each prepared game character by increasing or decreasing a value of a standard registration fee by a value corresponding to the deviation. In this case registration fees can be determined by increasing or decreasing a value of a standard registration fee depending on usage ratios. The value of standard may be common to a plurality of game characters or may be individually determined for each game character. For example when offensive capability and defensive capability differ depending on an individual game character it is preferable to determine the value of the standard individually for each game character. Registration fees will be set higher for capable game characters to impede registration so that it is possible to enhance the rarity value of the second information recording medium storing the character information indicating such a game character.

Furthermore in the game system it is preferable that each game device A B further include a dispensing mechanism for dispensing a new second information recording medium when a game has been finished. In the second process the registration fee determiner S determines the registration fee for at least a part part or all of the prepared game characters by increasing or decreasing a value of a standard registration fee on the basis of the deviation and an incidence probability of each game character showing a probability that a game character indicated by the game character information recorded on the new second information recording medium dispensed from the dispensing mechanism is the corresponding game character. Registration of a game character with a player s entity requires obtaining a second information recording medium by the player. Second information recording media are dispensed from a game device when games are finished. On second information recording medium character information indicating a game character uniquely is stored. A game character with a lower incidence probability among the second information recording media has a lower probability of being registered. On the other hand a game character with a higher incidence probability has a higher probability of being registered. If the registration fee of a game character having a lower incidence probability is expensive the probability of the game character being registered will be reduced more so that the registration fee of the game character will be more expensive. By referring to not only usage ratios but also incidence probabilities registration fees are determined in a coordinated manner.

In the game system preferably each game device A B further includes a delivery requester that generates at the time of each game device being activated a registration fee information delivery request requesting for delivery of the registration fee information and that transmits to the server device the registration fee information delivery request. Preferably the registration fee information deliverer of the server device upon receiving a registration fee information delivery request from one of the game devices transmits the registration fee information to the game device A B that has transmitted the registration fee information delivery request. A player will want to know the registration fee of a game character for registering the game character with the player s entity. In the present invention registration fees which are determined by the server device change. In each game device that queries the server device about the registration fee of a game character whenever players want to conduct registration there will be a large number of times of communication resulting in increase in the workload for the server device. However in the present invention each game device receives the registration fee information of a plurality of game characters in a group when the game device is activated so that communication resources are conserved and the workload for the server device is reduced. Furthermore each game device receives the registration fee information at the time of activation thereof and the reception will be completed before players start games thereby preventing concentration of the workload for each game device.

According to the present invention there is provided a game system in which each player uses game characters registered with the player s entity for playing games and in which popularity degrees or usage ratios of game characters are not significantly biased.

Each game device executes operations for a professional wrestling game. This professional wrestling game is designed so that individual players manage and possibly develop their own virtual entities. Each virtual entity is operated by means of an individual management fund therefor. The individual management fund for each entity increases when the entity gains an income by holding a show. In a show at least one virtual wrestler belonging to an entity battles against another virtual wrestler belonging to another entity in an arena. Therefore each player should register one or more wrestlers with the player s own entity in advance. This registration needs a registration fee. In addition a rental fee is necessary for each player s entity to rent an arena. These fees constitute a payout of such an entity so that the amount of the management fund of the entity decreases depending on the entity s payout. However it is not permissible for the amount of the management fund of any entity to become negative. Accordingly an amusement factor of this game is earning a higher box office income through management of an entity with a limited management fund. It should be noted in this specification that money such as funds and fees means virtual money that is a standard of value of exchange that is effective only in a virtual world i.e. virtual space within this game and is actually a numeric value represented in data stored in the game system as will be described later except for coins which players will deposit into a game device.

A first console panel extending horizontally is situated below the display . On the center of the first console panel there is provided a stage on which various cards used for the professional wrestling game will be placed. A second console panel is located in the vicinity of the first console panel . There is a step between the first console panel and the second console panel . On the left side of the first console panel there is provided a manual operation button set constituting four manual operation buttons and . The manual operation button through serve as an input unit by which a player instructs the player s virtual wrestler to attempt a pinfall cover on the opponent. Two manual operation buttons and are located on the right side of the first console panel . The manual operation button serves as an input unit by which a player instructs the player s wrestler to counterattack against the opponent when an attack is received from the opponent. The manual operation button serves as an input unit by which a player instructs the player s wrestler to perform ukemi a falling technique to minimize injury when an attack is received from the opponent.

Playing the professional wrestling game requires the use of an entry card a wrestler card and a technique card . On each entry card a unique card ID is recorded. Each player possesses an entry card for identifying the player when a game is started. The card ID thus functions as an identifier for identifying each player.

Each wrestler card corresponds to a wrestler i.e. a virtual game character that can appear in the professional wrestling game. Therefore there are as many types of wrestler cards as there are wrestlers that can appear in the professional wrestling game. However in a rare case a plurality of types of wrestler cards may be prepared in conformity to a plurality of characters performed by a single wrestler since even a single wrestler may perform as a heel i.e. a villain a babyface i.e. a good guy a masked wrestler a strong wrestler and or a weak wrestler. On each wrestler card there are recorded a wrestler ID for identifying a wrestler game character and wrestler information corresponding to the wrestler ID. The wrestler information includes the wrestler s name a portrait of the wrestler and initial values of parameters of the wrestler that will be described later.

Each technique card corresponds to an attack technique that virtual wrestlers launch against opponents in the professional wrestling game. Therefore there are as many types of technique cards as there are attack techniques that can be used on the professional wrestling game. On each technique card there is recorded a technique ID for identifying an attack technique ID.

In an exemplified embodiment a card ID is magnetically recorded on an entry card whilst each of a wrestler ID and a technique ID is represented as a bar code on a wrestler card or a technique card . Such bar codes are printed with an invisible ink so called stealth ink having a high transmittance with respect to visible light.

A bar code reader is situated at an edge of the first console panel . As will be described later the bar code reader reads bar codes printed on wrestler cards and technique cards used in the professional wrestling game. A player will place a card on the second console panel and slide it transversely under the bar code reader for inputting the information on the card. If the stealth ink absorbs or reflects infrared light the bar code reader has a light emitter for emitting infrared light and a light receiver for receiving infrared light. However the wavelength features of the light emitter and receiver can be selected depending on the reflection and absorption characteristics of the stealth ink used.

A card slot is formed at the right side of the second console panel . When a player has inserted the player s entry card into the card slot the card ID recorded on the entry card can be read.

A communication interface communicates with the router see in compliance with a predetermined protocol under control of the CPU . The display is a CRT cathode ray tube liquid crystal display plasma display or another suitable image display. A button sensor group consists of four button sensors which correspond to the manual operation buttons through respectively. Each of four button sensors outputs a manipulation signal according to manipulation of the corresponding manual operation buttons one of through by a player. Similarly a button sensor group corresponds to the manual operation buttons and

The bar code reader reads bar codes printed on wrestler cards or technique cards and outputs a wrestler ID or a technique ID in response to reading. A coin sensor detects that a coin has been inserted through the coin slot and then outputs a detection signal. A card reader reads a card ID on an entry card and then outputs the card ID when an entry card is inserted into the card slot . A card dispensing mechanism dispenses through the outlet slot a new card pack that is presented to a player as privilege in exchange for playing the professional wrestling game whenever a game is finished. In a card pack a wrestler card or a technique card is wrapped. By obtaining a card pack a player can use a newly obtained wrestler card or technique card in the next opportunity of playing the game. Accordingly a player can register a new wrestler with the player s entity or increase variation of techniques that can used in a match so that the amusement factor is improved.

A communication address indicating a game device that is waiting for its opponent can be registered in the entry list EL. Communication addresses of game devices are used as information for identifying game devices or as information for specifying opponents. Upon receiving an entry request from a game device the server device records on the entry list EL the communication address and the receiving time. The server device searches at predetermined intervals the entry list EL for information having a receiving time from which a predetermined period has passed and deletes such information from the entry list EL. The server device then sends a deletion response to the game device indicated by the communication address that has been deleted from the entry list EL the deletion response indicating that the communication address of the game device has been deleted from the entry list EL. Upon receiving the deletion response the game device knows that no opponent has appeared and executes a game in which the opponent is the CPU thereof. On the other hand when the entry list EL stores a communication address of a game device and when the server device receives an entry request from another game device the server device informs the game device that has sent the new entry request of the communication address of the game device stored in the entry list EL. Upon receiving the communication address of the other game device the game device sends a matchup request to the game device corresponding to the communication address reported by the server device . Thus match making is completed and players on each side can play a match against each other using these game devices.

The entity information includes the entity name wrestler IDs wrestler parameters and the date and time of match. The entity name is the name of entity managed by the corresponding player. An entity is limited to a predetermined number of wrestlers ten in this embodiment . Each wrestler ID associated with an entity name indicates a wrestler belonging to the entity. In such a game if registration of a large number of types of wrestlers with an entity is allowed data of wrestlers with respect to an entity will be huge. Since the server device that holds data indicating registered wrestlers for many entities should deliver such data to game devices appropriately such huge amounts of data will increase the workload for the server device and the network. In order to avoid increase of the workload in this embodiment the number of wrestlers that can be registered with each entity is limited.

Each wrestler ID is associated with a plurality of wrestler parameters. The wrestler parameters include power speed skill and toughness. The power speed and skill are wrestler parameters in connection with the wrestler s offensive capability. The toughness is a wrestler parameter indicating the wrestler s durability against harm received from the opponent. These wrestler parameters can be improved by sending the wrestler in a match or by training the wrestler. Each wrestler ID is also associated with the date and time of match. The date and time of match indicates the date and time at which the wrestler played a match.

Thus the individual information table TBL functions as an individual information memory part. In this embodiment the individual information table TBL is stored in the RAM but may be stored in another suitable storage device such as a hard disk.

Returning to the ROM stores a boot program which is read out when the server device is booted up. The communication interface communicates with the plurality of game devices settled in the game arcades A and B via the router R see . The CPU makes the monitor display operational states.

Next operations of the game system will be described. Lets us assume that a player will use the game device A for playing the professional wrestling game. is a flow chart showing operations executed in the game device A. If the player would like to play the professional wrestling game for the first time the player should buy a starter pack at an automatic card vending machine. The starter pack includes an entry card a wrestler card and five technique cards . Then the player can start playing the professional wrestling game using the entry card and so on within the starter pack.

When the game device A is activated the CPU of the game device A sends the server device a registration fee information delivery request requesting for delivery of a registration fee list. Upon receiving the registration fee information delivery request the server device serves as a registration fee information deliverer that generates a delivery response including a registration fee list and returns the delivery response to the game device A. The game device A stores in the RAM which is a first storage device the registration fee list received from the server device . The registration fee list indicates the registration fee for each of wrestlers that can appear in the professional wrestling game. shows an example of the registration fee list. For example the registration fee for the wrestler corresponding to the wrestler ID 0002 is 3 500 000. By referring to the registration fee list the fee necessary for registering each wrestler can be known. In this embodiment the server device changes registration fees for some or all of the wrestlers in the professional wrestling game in accordance with popularity of wrestlers. The recalculation of registration fees will be described below.

When the player inserts the entry card into the card slot the CPU reads the card ID from the entry card and then writes the card ID into an individual information memory area R step S . Then the CPU transmits an entry request indicating the card ID recorded on the individual information memory area R to the server device step S . The entry request reaches the server device and is received by the CPU . The CPU reads from the individual information table TBL an individual information set corresponding to the card ID indicated by the present entry request. Next the CPU generates an entry response including this individual information set and returns the entry response to the game device A. Therefore an entry request is not only a message of a player using a game device for requesting the server device to designate the opponent in order to start playing but is also a message individual information acquisition request for requesting that the server device send to the game device the individual information set in connection with the player. An entry response including an individual information set is an individual information acquisition response replying to an entry request. The CPU of the game device is an individual information acquisition requester that transmits an individual information acquisition request to the server device and receives an individual information acquisition response from the server device . The CPU of the server device is an individual information acquisition replier that returns an individual information acquisition response to a game device in response to an individual information acquisition request. However if individual information table TBL does not store an individual information set corresponding to the received card ID the CPU generates an entry response containing a nonregistration indication indicating that the player has not been registered and a registration fee list and returns the entry response to the game device A.

Upon receiving the entry response the game device A stores in the individual information memory area R of the RAM the individual information set included in the entry response step S . The RAM thus serves as a second storage device for storing an individual information set. Then the CPU determines whether or not the entity corresponding to the card ID has been registered step S . More specifically if an entry response containing an individual information set has been received the CPU determines that the player s entity has been registered. If an entry response containing a nonregistration indication has been received the CPU determines that the player s entity has not been registered.

If it has been determined that the player s entity has not been registered the CPU advances the routine to step S and executes an entity name registration routine. In the entity name registration routine the CPU makes the display show an entry name registration image for registration of the entity name and prompts the player to input the entity name and a password by means of this image. shows an example of such an entry name registration image. When the player manipulates the manual operation buttons and selects characters within the character table in area X thereby inputting the entity name area X will show the entity name in response. In this example the entity name is ABC PRO WRESTLING . Thereafter when the player manipulates the manual operation buttons and fixes the input entity name the CPU adds the entity name in the individual information set stored in the individual information memory area R.

However if it has been determined that the entity has been registered the CPU makes the display show a menu image step S . The menu image represents a menu including Start a match and Manage my entity .

When the player has selected a process from among the menu the CPU determines which process has been selected step S and executes an operation according to the selection. If the player has selected Manage my entity the CPU executes a registration dismissal routine. In this routine a wrestler is registered with or dismissed from the player s entity corresponding to the card ID.

The CPU shows in area X the number of registered wrestlers according to the counted number of the wrestler IDs. In addition the CPU activates the registration button X for allowing a wrestler to be registered if the number of wrestler IDs in the individual information memory area R is less than a predetermined threshold for example ten . Otherwise the CPU inactivates the registration button X in order to disable registration of a new wrestler. Furthermore if the number of registered wrestler IDs is less than another predetermined threshold for example one the CPU inactivates the dismissal button X in order to disable dismissal of a wrestler. Otherwise the CPU activates the dismissal button X for allowing a wrestler to be dismissed.

In this example area X shows the number of wrestlers registered at present and the upper limit of the number of wrestlers. If this display is omitted a player may misunderstand and think that the inactivation of the registration button X is a failure of the device if the player does not recognize the upper limit number or the number of registered wrestlers. In this example that which is shown in area X will prevent a player from misunderstanding. In an alternative embodiment only that which is shown in area X is conducted but activation and deactivation of registration button X and dismissal button X are omitted.

Next the CPU determines whether or not the player has selected registration of a wrestler step S . If the determination is affirmed by the player s selection of registration of a wrestler the CPU makes the display show a message for facilitating registration of a wrestler for example Get the wrestler card which you want to register with your entity through the bar code reader as shown in . When the player gets the player s desirable wrestler card through the bar code reader as a result of the message the CPU retrieves from the wrestler card the wrestler ID step S . The CPU then specifies the registration fee corresponding to this wrestler ID on the basis of the registration fee list step S .

Next the CPU reads the fund information from the individual information memory area R and serves as a comparer that determines whether or not the current amount of fund indicated by the fund information is equal to or greater than the registration fee for the wrestler step S . If the amount of fund is less than the registration fee the CPU makes the display show an error message image and returns the routine to step S. The error message image includes a message that the wrestler cannot be registered because of lack of funds.

However if the amount of fund is equal to or greater than the registration fee the CPU serves as a registration permitter that permits registration of the wrestler with the player s entity. More specifically the CPU makes the display show a registration confirmation picture step S . This registration confirmation picture contains images of wrestler information the wrestler s name the wrestler s portrait and the initial values of the wrestler parameters retrieved from the wrestler card an image of the registration fee for the wrestler provided by the server device an image of the entity name an image of the amount of the management fund and an image of messages for guiding registration and cancellation.

Next the CPU waits for completion of the player s registration or cancellation. More specifically the CPU determines whether or not the registration has been instructed and determines whether or not the cancellation has been instructed if the registration has not been instructed. If the registration or the cancellation has not been instructed the CPU returns the routine to step S. Let us assume that during the waiting state the player has instructed the registration by manipulating the manual operation buttons. In this case the CPU registers the wrestler with the player s entity and updates the amount of the management fund of the player s entity step S . More specifically the CPU newly writes into individual information memory area R the wrestler ID and the initial values of the wrestler parameters retrieved from the wrestler card. The CPU overwrites into the individual information memory area R fund information indicating the new amount of management funds that is the amount of management funds read last from the individual information memory area R minus the registration fee for the wrestler and shows a message that the registration of the wrestler has been completed. Accordingly the CPU serves as a second updater that updates the individual information set in the RAM so as to contain the wrestler ID and new fund information.

If the player has not selected registration until step S the CPU determines whether or not dismissal has been selected step S . If the player has not select dismissal the CPU returns the routine to step S. On the other hand if the player has selected dismissal the CPU makes the display show all wrestlers corresponding to all wrestler IDs registered with the entity information in the individual information set corresponding to the card ID step S for inducing the player to specify a wrestler to be dismissed. When the player specifies the wrestler to be dismissed by manipulating the manual operation buttons the CPU makes the display show a dismissal confirmation picture step S . The dismissal confirmation picture contains images of wrestler information the wrestler s name the wrestler s portrait the wrestler parameters and the registration fee of the wrestler to be dismissed an image of the entity name an image of the amount of the management fund and an image of messages for guiding dismissal and cancellation.

Next the CPU waits for completion of the player s dismissal or cancellation. More specifically the CPU determines whether or not the dismissal has been instructed and determines whether or not the cancellation has been instructed if the dismissal has not been instructed. If the dismissal or the cancellation has not been instructed the CPU returns the routine to step S. Let us assume that during the waiting state the player has instructed the dismissal by manipulating the manual operation buttons. In this case the CPU deletes the wrestler ID of the dismissed wrestler from the individual information set stored in the individual information memory area R step S .

As described above a registration fee is necessary for registering a wrestler with an entity and the registration is allowed only when the amount of funds is equal to or greater than the registration fee. Therefore if the registration fee for a wrestler is high the number of requests of registering the wrestler will be reduced and if the registration fee is low the number of requests of registering the wrestler will be raised

Referring back to until step S the player has selected Start a match the CPU executes a training routine step S . As described above the wrestler s offensive capability and durability are governed by wrestler parameters. The training routine trains a wrestler and updates the wrestler parameters.

In the training routine the CPU makes the display display a wrestler selection menu image by which the player selects a wrestler to be trained. In the game program of this example the wrestler trained through the training routine will be entered for a match. shows an example of the wrestler selection menu image. At the center of the wrestler selection menu image portraits and wrestler parameters of candidate wrestlers are displayed. When the player manipulates the manual operation buttons to scroll the wrestler portraits transversely the candidate wrestler may be changed. When the player has fixed the wrestler to be trained by manipulating the manual operation buttons the CPU makes the display show a training menu image in which are prepared power training speed training toughness training technique polishing and so on. Power training is designed to improve the power parameter. Speed training is designed to improve the speed parameter. Toughness training is designed to improve the toughness parameter. Technique polishing is designed to improve the skill parameter. When technique polishing is selected the player must get the technique card through the bar code reader so as to designate the technique to be polished. By virtue of training one or more wrestler parameters of the wrestler are changed so that the CPU updates the contents of the individual information set recorded in the individual information memory area R.

Then the CPU executes a matchup routine step S . In the matchup routine the CPU first makes the display show an arena selection menu image for facilitating choice of an arena from among a plurality of arenas. If the player has selected and confirmed an arena by manipulating the manual operation buttons the arena is specified. Next the CPU makes the display show an image for facilitating choice of matchup mode. Candidates of matchup mode include intra arcade matchup mode in which the opponent is sought within the same game arcade global matchup mode in which the opponent is sought all over the world and CPU matchup mode in which a computer is the opponent. If intra arcade matchup mode or global matchup mode has been selected the game device A sends an entry request to the server device . The server device determines the opponent on the basis of the entry list as described above and informs the game device A of the other game device that is the opponent. Thereafter the CPU starts executing various procedures for a matchup.

Arenas prepared in the professional wrestling game have different capacities and accordingly require different rental fees. The greater the capacity the higher the rental fee. The box office income for an entity at one show is determined by the product of the ticket price and the number of spectators. The ticket price may be determined for each arena or may be fixed irrespective of arena. The number of spectators is determined on the basis of the degree of excitement of the spectators at the latest show of the same entity. The degree of excitement of the spectators depends on details of a match. More specifically a match is divided into a plurality of parts and a measure of the degree of harmonization of the practical course and the predetermined scenario is calculated as points for each of the parts whereby the excitement degree is calculated. For example let us assume that a match is divided into three parts. Each of these parts is associated with a preferred story evolution. For example in a match between a heel wrestler and a babyface wrestler high points will be given at the first part when simple attacks are exchanged. At the second part high points will be given when the heel wrestler is in the advantageous position by for example rough attacks. At the third part when the babyface wrestler endures and finally wins with a deadly blow high points will be given. The excitement degree is a sum of the points of each part. The number of spectators in the next show reflects the current excitement degree of spectators thus obtained depending on details of a match so that the player can feel amusement of managing shows in addition to the win or loss results of individual matchups.

When a match has been finished the CPU serves as a first updater for updating the fund information on the basis of the details of the match. A new amount of funds Z2 after finishing a match is calculated by Equation 1 . 21 1 where Z1 is the amount of fund the current amount of fund before starting the matchup routine K is the rental fee of the arena C is the ticket price and M is the number of spectators.

The CPU updates the individual information set in the individual information memory area R in such a manner that the new individual information set contains the fund information indicating the new amount of funds Z2 calculated in accordance with Equation 1 .

Then the CPU makes the display show an image for facilitating continuation of the professional wrestling game and determines whether or not the player has deposited a coin and has instructed continuation of the game within a predetermined time step S . If continuation of the game has been instructed the CPU returns the routine to step S. However if the player has not selected continuation of the game the CPU controls the card dispensing mechanism to dispense a new card pack step S .

Next the CPU executes a save routine step S . In the save routine the CPU serves as an individual information update requester. That is the CPU retrieves the card ID and the individual information set from the individual information memory area R generates an individual information update request that includes data indicating the calculated excitement degree of spectators the card ID and the individual information set and transmits the individual information update request to the server device . If a new wrestler has been registered and the matchup routine has been executed the individual information set in the individual information update request contains character or wrestler information indicating the wrestler ID newly registered with the player s entity and fund information indicating the amount of fund updated in accordance with details of the match minus the registration fee for the newly registered wrestler or the amount of funds reflecting details of the match minus the registration fee for the newly registered wrestler . Therefore the individual information set in the individual information update request contains the update results by both of the first updater and the second updater. On the other hand if the matchup routine has been executed but registration of a new wrestler has not been executed no new wrestler has been registered only the update result of the first updater is included in the individual information set to be sent to the server device . In contrast if only registration of a wrestler has been executed a new wrestler has been newly registered only the update result of the second updater is included in the individual information set to be sent to the server device . If a wrestler has been dismissed the individual information set in which the wrestler ID of the dismissed wrestler has been deleted is transmitted to the server device . In summary whenever the matchup routine the registration of a wrestler or the dismissal of a wrestler has been executed the individual information set in the individual information memory area R is overwritten and updated. The latest updated result of the individual information set is sent to the server device when the player quits the continuing process in the game device.

The server device serves as an individual information updater. That is to say upon receiving an individual information update request the server device refers to the card ID in the request and updates the individual information set in the individual information table TBL corresponding to the card ID by replacing the individual information set by the individual information set included in the individual information update request. The individual information set updated by the server device contains data indicating the excitement degree of spectators in connection with the corresponding entity. Upon receiving a next entry request indicating the same card ID from a game device the server device transmits an entry response containing the data indicating the excitement degree of spectators to the requesting game device and therefore the requesting game device can determine the number of spectators on the basis of the latest excitement degree of spectators.

Next a registration fee calculation routine executed in the server device will be described. is a flow chart showing the registration fee calculation routine. First the CPU refers to the individual information table TBL and counts the number of card IDs having individual information set in which a wrestler ID is registered the number of individual wrestler registrations . The CPU repeats counting for each wrestler ID step S . Thus the number of individual wrestler registrations with respect to a wrestler is the number of players more exactly the number of entry cards who uses the wrestler.

Next the CPU calculates the number of total wrestler registrations that is the sum of the numbers of individual wrestler registrations step S . For example let us assume that one hundred wrestlers can appear in the professional wrestling game and that wrestler IDs from 0001 to 0100 are assigned to the wrestlers respectively. shows examples of numbers of individual wrestler registrations counted for wrestler IDs respectively. In the numbers of individual wrestler registrations for wrestler IDs 0001 through 0100 are P1 through P100 respectively. The number of total wrestler registrations Q is calculated as follows 12 . . . 100

Then the CPU serves as a degree of popularity computer for computing the registration ratio for each wrestler ID step S . The registration ratio is an index of the degree of popularity of a wrestler and is calculated as a ratio of the number of individual wrestler registrations for the wrestler ID to the number of total wrestler registrations. Therefore the registration ratio for a wrestler ID is the ratio of the number of entities with which the wrestler is registered to the total of the numbers of all entities with which all wrestlers are registered. For example the registration ratio for wrestler ID 0001 is P1 Q. When a wrestler s popularity is higher the wrestler may be registered with a large number of entities. This raises the number of entities with which the wrestler is registered so that the registration ratio for that wrestler is also raised. On the other hand the number of entities with which an unpopular wrestler is registered may be less so that the registration ratio for that wrestler will be low.

Next the CPU serves as a registration fee determiner for determining registration fees of each wrestler on the basis of the registration ratio for each wrestler step S . The method for determining registration fees is such that the higher a registration ratio the more expensive the registration fee. The method for determining registration fees may be but is not limited to one of the following schemes.

In a first scheme a standard value of a registration fee is determined for each wrestler ID in advance and the new registration fee for each wrester is a result of increasing or decreasing of the standard value on the basis of the deviation value of the registration ratio. For example when REF X is the standard value of a registration fee for a wrestler ID R X is the registration ratio for the wrestler ID Ris the average of registration ratios for all wrestlers and K is a coefficient for increasing or decreasing the registration fee the new registration fee H X corresponding to the registration ratio R X is calculated by Equation 2 . 2 

In this scheme the CPU may calculate the average Rof registration ratios for all wrestlers on the basis of all registration ratios R X for all wrestler ID and may then calculate the registration fee H X by Equation 2 . Consequently the CPU executes a first process for calculating the deviation value between the registration ratio of each individual wrestler and the average of registration ratios for all wrestlers and then executes a second process for determining the registration fee for each individual wrestler by increasing or decreasing of the standard value on the basis of the deviation value.

However a maximum limit and a minimum limit of the registration fee may be set. Since the number of registrations for a more popular wrestler will be enhanced convergently resulting in a very expensive registration fee a player who starts the game after others may be at a disadvantage. This disadvantage may be minimized by setting the maximum limit and the minimum limit of the registration fee.

In a second scheme the first scheme is modified in such a manner that the new registration fee for each wrester is determined on the basis of incidence probability of each wrestler card in addition to the factors used in the first scheme. The incidence probability is the ratio of the number of issued wrestler cards of a wrestler type wrestler ID to the total number of all wrestler cards issued by the game provider. In other words the incidence probability is the probability that the wrestler card in a card pack dispensed from the card outlet slot after finishing the game is the corresponding type of wrestler card. The wrestler s offensive capability and defensive capability differ depending on individual wrestlers and there may be one of the wrestlers who has an outstanding offensive capability and therefore is very strong. The incidence probability of the wrestler card corresponding to such a strong wrestler is set lower than those of other wrestler cards. Since players cannot register wrestlers with their entities without having wrestler cards the registration ratio will be lower for a wrestler of which the incidence probability is lower. Accordingly registration fees may be changed in accordance with each incidence probability.

More specifically when REF X is the standard value of the registration fee for a wrestler ID R X is the registration ratio for the wrestler ID Ris the average of registration ratios for all wrestlers K1 is a coefficient for increasing or decreasing the registration fee S X is the incidence probability S X of the wrestler card corresponding to the wrestler ID Sis the average of incidence probabilities of all wrestler cards and K2 is a coefficient for compensation the new registration fee H X corresponding to the registration ratio R X is calculated by Equation 3 . 1 2 3 

In the second scheme in a manner similar to that in the first scheme a maximum limit and a minimum limit of registration fee may be set. The compensation of registration fees on the basis of the incidence probabilities does not need to be performed for all wrestlers. In other words the compensation of registration fees may be performed for only some of wrestlers on the basis of the incidence probabilities in which the wrestlers correspond to rare cards of which the incidence probabilities are extremely low.

In a third scheme the new registration fee for each wrester is determined on the basis of incidence probability of each wrestler card and an expected value of the registration ratio. The expected value of the registration ratio is a value predetermined for each wrestler card in advance by the game designer and is an expected registration ratio determined on the basis of the total number of all types of wrestler cards and the incidence probability of a wrestler card .

More specifically when REF X is the standard value of registration fee for a wrestler ID R X is the registration ratio for the wrestler ID K1 is a coefficient for increasing or decreasing the registration fee and Rex is the expected value of the registration ratio for the wrestler ID the new registration fee H X corresponding to the registration ratio R X is calculated by Equation 4 . 1 4 

The expected value Rex of the registration ratio for a wrestler ID is for example calculated by Equation 5 . 1 5 where Q is the total number of all types of wrestler cards S X is the incidence probability of a wrestler card corresponding to the wrestler ID and Sis the average of incidence probabilities of all wrestler cards.

In this third scheme a ratio R X Rex of the actual registration ratio to the predetermined expected value standard value of the registration ratio is calculated and then the ratio R X Rex is multiplied by the coefficient thereby obtaining a compensation term. In this example when R X Rex equals one the new registration fee H X becomes a median value that is REF X K1. If the actual registration ratio exceeds the expected value of the registration ratio i.e. R X Rex is greater than one the registration fee H X is raised above the median value which is REF X K1. On the other hand if the actual registration ratio is less than the expected value of the registration ratio i.e. R X Rex is less than one the registration fee H X is lowered below the median value which is REF X K1.

In the third scheme in a manner similar to that in the first scheme a maximum limit and a minimum limit of the registration fee may be set. The compensation of registration fees may be performed for only some of the wrestlers on the basis of the incidence probabilities.

In a fourth scheme a maximum limit and a minimum limit of the registration fee are predetermined the maximum limit is associated with the actual maximum registration ratio the highest value among all registration ratios for all wrestler IDs and the minimum limit is associated with the actual minimum registration ratio the lowest value among all registration ratios for all wrestler IDs . The registration fee for a wrestler ID is determined on the basis of the level of the registration ratio of the wrestler ID within the range from the maximum registration ratio to the minimum registration ratio. The new registration fee H X for a wrestler ID corresponding to the registration ratio R X for the wrestler ID is calculated by Equation 6 . 6 where His the maximum limit of the registration fee His the minimum limit of registration fee Ris the maximum registration ratio and Ris the minimum registration ratio.

In a fifth scheme the range from the maximum registration ratio to the minimum registration ratio is divided into a plurality of ranks. The registration fee for a wrestler ID is determined on the basis of the rank to which the registration ratio of the wrestler ID belongs. For example a first rank is determined as an extent from the minimum registration ratio and less than 5 a second rank is determined as another extent from 5 and less than 10 and a third rank is determined as another extent from 10 to the maximum registration ratio. In this case the registration fee for a wrestler ID that belongs to the first rank may be 1 million the registration fee for a wrestler ID that belongs to the second rank may be 2 million and the registration fee for a wrestler ID that belongs to the third rank may be 3 million.

As described above in the first embodiment the registration fees necessary for registration of wrestlers are changed depending on registration ratios of wrestlers with entities i.e. degrees of popularity of wrestlers . Therefore convergence of registrations of a more popular wrestler can be prevented and registrations of wrestlers can be diversified resulting in reducing the probability that wrestlers of the same characteristics will play a match against each other so that the amusement factor is improved. In addition since the registration fee for an unpopular wrestler can be reduced the utility value of the wrestler card corresponding to such a wrestler for players will be enhanced thereby stimulating exchange of such a wrestler card among players. Furthermore since the utility value of the wrestler card corresponding to an unpopular wrestler for players will be enhanced the worth of card packs that players obtain is enhanced whereby the rate of operation of each game device can be improved.

In the first embodiment the index of degree of popularity of each wrestler is the registration ratio of each wrestler with entities that is calculated as the ratio of the number of individual wrestler registrations to the number of total wrestler registrations. However the index of degree of popularity is not limited to the above described embodiment. For example the index of degree of popularity of each wrestler may be a registration ranking of wrestlers for a certain period. This ranking can be calculated on the basis of not only the latest registration ratios but also former registration ratios and the records of wins and losses. In another alternative embodiment the index of degree of popularity of each wrestler may be the number of individual wrestler registrations of each wrestler rather than the registration ratio of each wrestler. In summary the index of degree of popularity of each wrestler may be selected so that the registration fee for a wrestler that more players will want to register with their entities can be set higher.

In the above described first embodiment registration fees are changed depending on registration ratios of wrestlers. In the second embodiment each registration fee is changed depending on the number of matches that each wrestler has entered. The game system according to the second embodiment includes the same structure as that of the game system according to the first embodiment shown in . Operations of each game device and the server device are essentially the same as those in the first embodiment but there is a difference in that each game device according to the second embodiment can transmit entered wrestler information to the server device and the server device determines registration fees on the basis of the number of matches that each wrestler has entered.

More specifically the CPU of a game device writes into its individual information memory area R the wrestler ID entered wrestler information of a wrestler that has been currently entered in a match. The entered wrestler information is specific information specifying a wrestler that a player has used for a match. Thus the CPU serves as a specific information generator that specifies the wrestler used in a competition and generates specific information. In addition the CPU sends at the save routine step S in entered wrestler information to the server device . Consequently the CPU serves as a specific information transmitter that transmits the specific information to the server device . The CPU may send the server device entered wrestler information as a component of the individual information update request or as another information flow. The CPU of the server device counts the number of matches that each wrestler entered on the basis of entered wrestler information received from each game device and records the number of matches for each wrestler into a management table TBL stored in the RAM

The CPU serves as a usage ratio computer for computing a usage ratio of each wrestler that is the ratio of the number of matches that each wrestler entered to the sum of the numbers of matches for all wrestlers. The usage ratio of each wrestler is the frequency of each wrestler having been used for competitions. More specifically the CPU calculates every week the usage ratio of each wrestler that is equivalent to a moving average. Thus the CPU updates the usage ratio of each wrestler once a week which is the basis for the calculation of the registration fees. The reason for updating the usage ratio once a week is that the rate of operation of each game device changes depending on the day of the week. For example many players go to arcades on weekends so as to increase the number of matches for each wrestler.

The CPU executes a usage ratio calculation routine shown in . First the subject period on which the usage ratio is calculated is determined step S . For example the last four weeks ending with the last Sunday are determined as the subject period on which the usage ratio is calculated. Next the CPU refers to the management table TBL and calculates the number of matches that each wrestler entered in the subject period. The CPU stores the number of matches that each wrestler entered individual number of matches for each wrestler at step S. Then the CPU calculates the sum of the individual numbers of matches for all wrestlers the total number of matches at step S. The number of matches is the sum of the numbers of matches competed in by all wrestlers in the subject period. Next the CPU computes the usage ratio of each wrestler by dividing the individual number of matches for each wrestler by the total number of matches step S .

Then the CPU serves as a registration fee determiner for determining registration fees of each wrestler on the basis of the usage ratio for each wrestler. The method for determining registration fees is such that the higher the usage ratio the more expensive the registration fee. The method for determining registration fees may be but is not limited to one of the following schemes.

In a first scheme a standard value of a registration fee is determined for each wrestler ID in advance and the new registration fee for each wrester is a result of increasing or decreasing of the standard value on the basis of the deviation value of the usage ratio. For example when REF X is the standard value of the registration fee for a wrestler ID V X is the usage ratio for the wrestler ID Vis the average of usage ratios for all wrestlers and K is a coefficient for increasing or decreasing the registration fee the new registration fee H X corresponding to the usage ratio V X is calculated by Equation 7 . 7 

In this scheme the CPU may calculate the average Vof usage ratios for all wrestlers on the basis of all registration ratios V X for all wrestler IDs and may then calculate the registration fee H X by Equation 7 . Consequently the CPU executes a first process for calculating the deviation value between the usage ratio of each individual wrestler and the average of usage ratios for all wrestlers and then executes a second process for determining the registration fee for each individual wrestler by increasing or decreasing of the standard value on the basis of the deviation value.

However a maximum limit and a minimum limit of the registration fee may be set. This is because setting a registration fee that differs greatly from the standard value may lead to very few registrations and may degrade the amusement factor.

In a second scheme the first scheme is modified in such a manner that the new registration fee for each wrestler is determined on the basis of incidence probability of each wrestler card in addition to the factors used in the first scheme. When REF X is the standard value of registration fee for a wrestler ID V X is the usage ratio for the wrestler ID Vis the average of usage ratios for all wrestlers K1 is a coefficient for increasing or decreasing the registration fee S X is the incidence probability S X of the wrestler card corresponding to the wrestler ID Sis the average of incidence probabilities of all wrestler cards and K2 is a coefficient for compensation the new registration fee H X corresponding to the usage ratio V X is calculated by Equation 8 . 1 2 8 

In the second scheme in a manner similar to that in the first scheme a maximum limit and a minimum limit of the registration fee may be set. The compensation of registration fees may be performed for only some of the wrestlers on the basis of the incidence probabilities in which the wrestlers correspond to rare cards for which the incidence probabilities are extremely low.

In a third scheme the new registration fee for each wrester is determined on the basis of the incidence probability of each wrestler card and an expected value of the usage ratio. The expected value of the usage ratio is a value predetermined for each wrestler card in advance by the game designer and is an expected usage ratio determined on the basis of the total number of all types of wrestler cards and the incidence probability of a wrestler card .

More specifically when REF X is the standard value of the registration fee for a wrestler ID V X is the usage ratio for the wrestler ID K1 is a coefficient for increasing or decreasing the registration fee and Vex is the expected value of the usage ratio for the wrestler ID the new registration fee H X corresponding to the usage ratio V X is calculated by Equation 9 . 1 9 

The expected value Vex of the usage ratio for a wrestler ID is for example calculated by Equation 10 . 1 10 where Q is the total number of all types of wrestler cards S X is the incidence probability of a wrestler card corresponding to the wrestler ID and Sis the average of incidence probabilities of all wrestler cards.

In this third scheme a ratio V X Vex of the actual usage ratio to the predetermined expected value standard value of the usage ratio is calculated and then the ratio V X Vex is multiplied by the coefficient thereby obtaining a compensation term. In this example when V X Vex equals one the new registration fee H X becomes a median value that is REF X K1. If the actual usage ratio exceeds the expected value of the usage ratio i.e. V X Vex is greater than one the registration fee H X is raised than the median value which is REF X K1. On the other hand if the actual usage ratio is less than the expected value of the usage ratio i.e. R X Rex is less than one the registration fee H X is lowered than the median value which is REF X K1.

In the third scheme as similar to the first scheme a maximum limit and a minimum limit of registration fee may be set. The compensation of registration fees may be performed for only a part of wrestlers on the basis of the incidence probabilities.

In a fourth scheme a maximum limit and a minimum limit of registration fee are predetermined the maximum limit is associated with the actual maximum usage ratio the highest value among all usage ratios for all wrestler IDs and the minimum limit is associated with the actual minimum usage ratio the lowest value among all usage ratios for all wrestler IDs . The registration fee for a wrestler ID is determined on the basis of the level of the usage ratio of the wrestler ID within the extent from the maximum usage ratio to the minimum usage ratio. The new registration fee H X for a wrestler ID corresponding to the usage ratio R X for the wrestler ID is calculated by Equation 11 . 11 where His the maximum limit of registration fee His the minimum limit of registration fee Vis the maximum usage ratio and Vis the minimum usage ratio.

In a fifth scheme the extent from the maximum usage ratio to the minimum usage ratio is divided into a plurality of ranks. The registration fee for a wrestler ID is determined on the basis of the rank to which the usage ratio of the wrestler ID belongs. For example a first rank is determined as a range from the minimum usage ratio and less than 5 a second rank is determined as another range from 5 and less than 10 and a third rank is determined as another range from 10 to the maximum usage ratio. In this case the registration fee for a wrestler ID that belongs to the first rank may be 1 million the registration fee for a wrestler ID that belongs to the second rank may be 2 million and the registration fee for a wrestler ID that belongs to the third rank may be 3 million.

As described above in the second embodiment registration fees necessary for registration of wrestlers are changed depending on usage ratios of wrestlers by entities. Therefore convergence of registrations of a more popular wrestler can be prevented and registrations of wrestlers can be diversified resulting in reducing the probability that wrestlers of the same characteristics will play a match against each other so that the amusement factor is improved. In addition since the registration fee for an unpopular wrestler can be reduced the utility value of the wrestler card corresponding to such a wrestler for players will be enhanced thereby stimulating exchange of such a wrestler card among players. Furthermore since the utility value of the wrestler card corresponding to an unpopular wrestler for players will be enhanced the worth of card packs that players obtain is enhanced whereby the rate of operation of each game device can be improved.

While the present invention has been described such that a professional wrestling game has been used as an example of practical use it is to be understood that the purpose of the present invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described above. The above described network game can be applied to any other type of game in which a game character registered with an entity managed by a player plays against another game character registered with another entity managed by another player. The term game character as used in the specification may be an athlete of another sport a robot an animal or a chimerical game character. Any system computing registration fees necessary for registering such game characters with players entities on the basis of degree of popularity for example registration ratio or usage ratio falls within the scope of the present invention.

In the above described embodiments card IDs identifiers are magnetically recorded on entry cards first information recording media and the card reader first reader reads the card ID magnetically recorded on an entry card.
