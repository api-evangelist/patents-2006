The present invention generally relates to systems and methods for designing reflectors and more particularly to a system and method for designing a free form reflector.

Non imaging reflectors are widely used in illumination and solar energy systems. In these applications a non imaging reflector is designed to convert the Lambertian source into a beam with a divergence of half angle without loss of throughput. One direct design approach is to using algebraic methods among which a tailored edge ray approach has made a great success. In this approach a two dimensional 2D reflector is determined by reflector equations that are deduced from an edge ray method and conservation of energy. For a three dimensional 3D reflector design it is common to solve the problem by reducing three dimensions to two dimensions. Thus a 3D reflector can be generated by means of rotational or translational symmetry. The second approach is indirect and it uses optimization based design techniques. The analytic knowledge of the connection between the reflector structure and optical performance is not needed. Free form surfaces such as a B zier surface and a non uniform rational basis splines NURBS surface are appropriate to represent the shape of a reflector in these automated design approaches.

A genetic algorithm has been proven to be valuable both in imaging and non imaging optics since Holland laid down the basic principles of genetic algorithms. A differential evolution DE is a variation of the genetic algorithm proposed by R. Storn and K. Price. The DE stood out in the first IEEE conference on evolutionary computation and then it was widely applied in various fields. Compared with standard the genetic algorithm the DE uses floating point variables. In addition the crossover and mutation implementations are more complex. The NURBS is a powerful technique for constructing general curves and surfaces. It has many good properties for example the order of the surface is independent of the number of control points. Local changes to the surface shape are possible because individual control points have only local influences. The algorithm combines the global search capability of the DE with the flexibility of the shape adjustment of free form surface which has been used in the second approach of reflector design. S. Doyle used cubic B zier curve to represent the profile of a reflector and thus a paraboloid and ellipse reflector can be obtained by using his algorithm.

For the design of a non imaging reflector what is needed is a system and method for designing a free form reflector that performs an automated free form reflector generation which can be applied for the design of more general reflectors.

A preferred embodiment of a system for designing a free form reflector in accordance with a preferred embodiment includes a user input interface a free form reflector design unit and a free form reflector output unit.

The NURBS algorithm generating module is configured for generating a non uniform rational basis splines NURBS algorithm according to the data received by the user input interface and for describing a free form surface by performing the NURBS algorithm. The NURBS has become an industry standard for the representation design and data exchange of geometric information processed by computers. The excellent mathematical and algorithmic properties combined with successful industrial applications have contributed to the enormous popularity of the NURBS. The mathematical expression of a NURBS curve is described as the first equation 

The merit evaluation function constructing module is configured for constructing a merit evaluation function in order to calculate the difference between the desired illuminance distribution and a current distribution generated by a current reflector. In the preferred embodiment a receiver is divided to m n mesh. The illuminance value of each bin is calculated when the merit evaluation function is defined as the second equation 

The DE algorithm generating module is configured for generating a differential evolution DE algorithm to facilitate a calculation of an optimum free form surface. With the merit evaluation function defined and the coordinates of the control points of a reflector profile used as variables the DE algorithm is performed to determine the reflector shape contour that generates the desired illuminance distribution. Referring to the string of the numbers that characterize the reflector profile as being a chromosome and the numbers that compose the chromosome i.e. the NURBS curve controls the point coordinates and weights in a manner similar to genes. The DE algorithm performs the steps as follows.

Step i initializing population generation randomly generating genes of an initial chromosome in a population between maximum and minimum values therefore according to the following equation X 0 X 0 X 0 . . . X 0 . In this equation the iterative counter t 0 the initial population is X 0 N is the population size and X 0 is an optimum chromosome in the initial population.

Step iv selection implementation calculating a merit evaluation function value of the child chromosome and comparing the merit evaluation function value of the child chromosome with the merit evaluation function value of the initial chromosome. The initial chromosome is replaced with the child chromosome in the population if the merit evaluation function value of the child chromosome is smaller than the merit evaluation function value of the initial chromosome. This selection implementation step is accomplished according to the fifth equation

Abundant numerical experiments show that the DE algorithm is an effective global optimization algorithm. Using the DE algorithm combined with the NURBS curve representation an automated non imaging reflector design algorithm is proposed. In the next sections several examples are given to illustrate the validity of the system and method described above.

The simulation results show that the reflectors generated by R. Winston s algorithm can produce a nearly prefect uniform illuminance distribution on the receiver. Such uniform illuminance distribution could also be obtained by using R. Winston s algorithm. In the preferred embodiment using an application programming language such as Visual Basic and an application programming interface such as a LightTools API a program is developed to perform the automated NURBS curve profile reflector design. In order to permit convenient description the reflector generated by utilizing an edge ray method ERM is referred to as an ERM reflector and the reflector generated by utilizing the program is referred to as a DE reflector.

A first example shows that both the ERM reflector and the DE reflector have uniform illuminance distributions within 0.513 0.513. Referring to and the endpoint coordinates of the reflector profiles are 1 0 and 2.01 0.89 . In the first example the ERM reflector is generated by setting 0.513 in the sixth set of equations as described above. The ERM reflector profile in YZ plane is obtained as shown in and the simulation result is shown in . In theory the length of the ERM reflector and the strip source should be infinite. In the simulation the ERM reflector and the source length are 300 mm. The limited length alters the desired irradiance distribution thus from it can be seen that the uniform illuminance distribution zone is not a rectangle but a barrel shape and the illuminance value is a little bit below the theoretical value of 50 lux. The receiver is divided into 39 39 bins.

The reflector profile is represented by a cubic NURBS curve and four control points are used to define the cubic NURBS curve. The coordinates and weights of the middle two control points are assumed as variables so there are six variables altogether. If the endpoint coordinates of the NURBS curve coincide with those of the ERM reflector profile endpoint then the sizes of the DE reflector and the ERM reflector are nearly the same. The coordinates of the NURBS curve endpoints in YZ plane are set to 0 1 and 0.89 2.01 respectively. The weights of head and the tail control points are all set to 1 . In order to generate a reasonable reflector profile the lower limit and the upper limit of the Y control point coordinates are respectively set to 1 and 3 and the lower limit and the upper limit of the Z control point coordinate are set to 0 and 0.89 respectively. Our objective is to obtain a uniform illuminance distribution on the receiver within 0.513 0.513 which corresponds to a 112 300 mm rectangle zone on the receiver 100 mm away. For optimization a 112 300 mm rectangle receiver is set up and is divided into 10 10 bins. The illuminance value of each bin is calculated by LightTools through tracing 10 000 rays and is used in the second equation to calculate the merit evaluation function value. In this example all the E in the second equation are set to 50 lux and all the Ware set to 0.0004 . The optimization parameters and the source and the receiver parameters are given in Table 1 as follows.

The DE reflector is obtained after fifty iterations and the DE reflector profile in YZ plane is shown in . This optimization process costs about four hours of computing time on a computer with Pentium 2.4 GHz CPU and 2 Gbytes RAM. Both the ERM reflector and the DE reflector superficially resemble a V trough. The subtle differences between these two reflectors the ERM reflector and the DE reflector and a true V trough are depicted in . After optimization 1 000 000 rays are traced and a 200 300 mm rectangle receiver is placed 100 mm away from the source. The simulation result produced by DE reflector is shown in . The receiver is divided into 39 39 bins as in the ERM reflector simulation. Vertical cuts through the center of the illuminance distributions are shown in . It can be seen from the simulation results that the DE reflector can generate almost the same uniform illuminance distribution as that of the ERM reflector in 0.513 0.513 angle range. The average illuminance difference of these 39 bins is only 3 .

A second example shows that both the ERM reflector and the DE reflector have uniform illuminance distribution within 0.733 0.733. Referring to and the endpoint coordinates of the ERM reflector profiles are 1 0 and 12.32 10.98 .

In the second example the ERM reflector is generated by setting 0.733 in the set of sixth equation as described above. The source used is the same as in the first example. The endpoint coordinates of the ERM reflector profile are 0 1 12.32 10.98 respectively and the ERM reflector profile in YZ plane is shown in . The simulation result is shown in . As in the first example four control points are used to represent the NURBS curve. In order to further test the validity of the present algorithm only the head control point is fixed with coordinates as 1 0 and a weight value thereof is assigned as 1 . The other three control points are all variable. The lower limit and upper limit of the Y control point coordinates are set to 1 and 18 respectively and the lower limit and the upper limit of the Z control point coordinates are respectively set to 0 and 11 . The control point weight ranges are 0 to 1 . Thus there are nine variables altogether. The optimization objective is to generate a uniform illuminance distribution on the receiver within 0.733 0.733 which corresponds to a 180 300 mm rectangle zone on the receiver from 100 mm away so a 180 300 mm rectangle receiver is set up and is divided into 10 10 bins. All the E in the second equation are still set to 50 lux and all the Ware set to 0.0004 . The optimization parameters and the source and the receiver parameters are given in Table 2 as follows.

The DE reflector is obtained after one hundred iterations and the DE reflector profile is shown in . It costs about eight hours of computing time on a computer with Pentium 2.4 GHz and 2 Gbytes RAM. The differences between these two reflectors the ERM reflector and the DE reflector and a true V trough are depicted in . Because the last control point is variable unlike the first example the obtained DE reflector is a little bit smaller than the ERM reflector. A new receiver with 200 300 mm size is placed 100 mm away from the source and 1 000 000 rays are traced to compare with the optical performance of corresponding ERM reflector after optimization. The simulation result of the DE reflector is shown in . Both receivers are divided into 39 39 bins. Vertical cut through the center of the illuminance distributions are shown in . The average illuminance difference of these 39 bins is only 5 . Although there is one more variable control point in the second example compared with first example after more iterations 100 times a satisfying uniform illuminance distribution could also be obtained.

A third example shows a method for designing a free form reflector having a concentrated illuminance distribution. One of the greatest advantages of the NURBS algorithm is their capability of precisely representing conic sections and circles as well as free form curves and surfaces. It can be proved that if control points are setting to P 0 0 2b 0 2b 2a 0 2a wherein a b weights are

In conclusion reflectors are the core components of many illumination and solar energy systems. According to the system and method for designing a free form reflector which can automatically design various no imaging reflectors by using the DE algorithm and the NURBS algorithm generated by the free form reflector design unit . The overall result is a simple automated non imaging reflector design technique and only a few data such as desired dimensions desired illuminance distributions and searching limits associated with a desired reflector are needed to be input by user via the user input interface . The reflector profile is represented by the NURBS curve in 2D space and then is generated by translational or rotational symmetry. The coordinates of control points of the NURBS curve and weights are used as variables. Compared with the edge ray method almost the same uniform illuminance distributions can be obtained using the DE algorithm for a given strip source. However the process is automatic and there is no need for user to know much theory about the non imaging reflector design. A desired concentrated illuminance distribution can also be obtained using the DE algorithm. The above described examples validate that a free form reflector designed by using the NURBS algorithm and the DE algorithm is not only feasible but also effective.
