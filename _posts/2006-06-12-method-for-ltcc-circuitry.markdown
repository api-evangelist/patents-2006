title: Method for LTCC circuitry
abstract: An LTCC (low temperature cofired ceramic) structure which has conductors to which leads are to be bonded for connection to external circuitry. The conductors include additives to promote adhesion to the ceramic layer. The presence of these additives degrade bonding performance. For better bondability of the leads, a pure conductor metal layer, devoid of the additives is placed on the conductors in areas where leads are to be bonded. This pure conductor metal layer may be cofired with the stack of ceramic layers or may be post fired after stack firing.

This application is a Divisional of application Ser. No. 10 786 125 filed on Feb. 26 2004 now abandoned the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference and for which priority is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 120.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract F33657 97 LTCC 0030 awarded by the Department of Defense. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

An LTCC circuit is comprised of a plurality of ceramic layers with passive and or active components and stacked together to form a module with each ceramic layer containing thick film printed circuitry metallization generally gold or silver. The ceramic layers include conductive vias for making electrical contact between layers and the ceramic layers are cofired at a temperature high enough to sinter the layers yet low enough so as prevent flowing or melting of the metallization. The result of the firing is to form a rigid monolithic structure.

LTCC circuits have high packing density can be customized to meet desired applications are cost effective reliable and can be controlled with respect to dielectric values. The LTCC allows for integration of digital and RF stripline and microstrip circuits in a single light weight 3 D package. Such LTCC circuits are used for high frequency applications in both military as well as commercial devices.

In order to electrically connect the LTCC structure to other circuitry wire or ribbon leads are bonded to conductors on the surface of the structure for connection to the other circuitry. A problem often arises however in that the bonded leads may form a poor contact with or pull loose from the conductors. This is due to the fact that the conductors contain one or more additives to promote conductor adhesion to the ceramic base layer and it is these additives which degrade the bonding of the leads.

It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide a low temperature co fired ceramic LTCC structure with much improved lead bondability.

An LTCC structure in accordance with the present invention consists of a plurality of stacked layers of ceramic material including metallization in predetermined patterns on and through the layers. The stacked layers include a plurality of exposed electrical conductors to which leads are to be bonded. The conductors are of a metal which includes one or more additives to promote adhesion to the ceramic layer on which the conductors are deposited. A bonding metal layer is deposited on top of the conductors at predetermined locations and is of the same metal as the conductors however devoid of the one or more additives. The leads are then bonded to the bonding metal layer for improved bonding performance.

The bonding metal layer may be deposited and may be cofired with the stack of ceramic layers. Alternatively the stack may be cofired and the bonding metal layer subsequently deposited and thereafter be fired in a second firing of the stack.

Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood however that the detailed description and specific example while disclosing the preferred embodiment of the invention is provided by way of illustration only since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the detailed description.

Referring now to there is illustrated an LTCC structure which is comprised of a plurality of ceramic layers to each having a pattern of metallization. It is to be noted that structure does not represent an actual circuit but is presented to show typical components which may be placed on the individual ceramic layers. Further in the description to follow the metallization will be described using gold by way of example.

Bottom layer includes a ground plane having voids where a ground plane is not desired. Layer has metallization areas for the mounting of active devices not shown and connected to passive devices such as capacitors by means of conductors . Surrounding metallization areas are vias which are vertical apertures in the layer filled with a specially formulated conductive material for making electrical contact with components on different layers.

Layer includes an opening or cavity to accommodate any active devices on metallization areas on the previous layer and includes a plurality of conductor pads to which leads from those active devices will be connected. In addition to vias layer also illustrates conductors some of which include passive devices in the form of resistors . The next two layers and both include vias and respective cavities and providing access to the active devices.

The top or surface layer includes cavity and vias to which are connected various conductors . Some conductors include resistors in their path while other conductors include metallization areas for placement of active devices. Further layer illustrates a plurality of conductor pads connected to components on a previous layer or layers and to which will be connected leads for connection to other circuitry in a system. Similarly various conductors will also be used for this purpose.

In the manufacture of the LTCC structure sections of green unfired ceramic tape of an appropriate size for processing are cut from a larger roll. Vias are formed such as by a punching process and filled with the conductive material. The conductors including the conductor pads are applied in desired patterns by a process using patterned screens to which are applied gold paste.

In order that the gold paste conductor pattern is suitably affixed to the ceramic tape layer the gold paste includes one or more additives to promote adhesion. Such additives commonly used include copper bismuth and glass by way of example depending upon the formulation of the ceramic material. Any cavities are then formed in appropriate layers which are then stacked and fired at a temperature of around 850 C. to sinter the gold paste and ceramic layers to form the solid unitary module shown in .

After firing leads are bonded to cavity and surface conductors so that the module may be connected to other circuitry of a system. These leads which may be wires or ribbons for example are bonded to the conductors by a process which includes both heat and ultrasonic vibration. A problem arises however in that at times the leads are poorly bonded and eventually come loose or do not initially bond at all. This may be attributed to the additives which are included in the conductor paste to promote adhesion to the ceramic layer. It is these additives which prevent optimal bonding.

The present invention obviates this problem by adding a bonding layer of the same metal as the conductor only in a pure state devoid of any of the additives contained in the conductor. In one embodiment this bonding layer may be applied to the conductors in a limited bonding area prior to firing and then be cofired along with the stack of ceramic layers. In a second embodiment the bonding layer may be applied to the conductors in a limited bonding area and may be post fired after the initial firing of the stack of ceramic layers. Any such bonding layer to be applied to conductors on intermediate ceramic layers such as conductor pads on layer in would have to use the cofired option.

In a similar fashion bonding layer also of pure gold devoid of any additives is affixed to a limited bonding area on conductor pad to ensure for a strong bond with lead .

In actual tests of LTCC lead bonds the present invention provided improved bondability that were from 10 to 20 stronger than conventional techniques. Further in some instances of prior art bonding the leads would not even bond to the conductors leading to a no stick situation. The present invention may reduce such no sticks by as much as 50 .

The foregoing detailed description merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which although not explicitly described or shown herein embody the principles of the invention and are thus within its spirit and scope.
