The present invention was made with United States Government support under contract number 03 009019 47236. The United States Government has certain rights in the present invention.

The present invention relates to sensing circuits in general and in particular to charge amplifier circuits. Still more particularly the present invention relates to an apparatus for reducing offset voltage drifts in a charge amplifier circuit.

Referring now to the drawings and in particular to there is illustrated a schematic diagram of a charge amplifier circuit capable of converting the output of a piezoelectric charge mode sensor to a corresponding voltage according to the prior art. As shown a charge amplifier circuit includes a piezoelectric sensor that is capable of producing a charge proportional to an applied mechanical force. As the voltage at one of the inputs to an operational amplifier begins to increase or decrease as a result of charge accumulation across a capacitor the voltage at an output V of operational amplifier will decrease or increase to maintain the voltage at the input of operational amplifier at near 0 V. Thus the voltage of output V is proportional to the charge output of piezoelectric sensor and the virtual ground at the second input of operational amplifier limits the charge lost due to parasitic capacitance and or leakage in all cables within charge amplifier circuit .

The capacitance C of capacitor determines the voltage at output V for a given amount of charges generated by piezoelectric sensor . Due to the input bias offset current ib a resistor is utilized to drain the accumulated charges on capacitor . With resistor operational amplifier acts as a high pass filter with a low frequency cutoff at 1 2 RC where R is the resistance of resistor and C is the capacitance of capacitor .

Because capacitor requires a relatively small capacitance C to achieve a reasonable output voltage one problem with charge amplifier circuit is that the resistance R of resistor must be very large in order to achieve a reasonable low frequency cutoff. The input bias offset current ib of operational amplifier flowing over resistor can cause a significant DC offset at output V. In addition the change in the input bias offset current ib over temperature can also result in a significant offset drift at output V. Even when using a JFET operational amplifier having an input bias offset current and drift per degree Celsius in the pico range the DC offset and offset drift per degree Celsius at output V can end up being in the milli range which is unacceptably high for most if not all precision applications. Consequently it would be desirable to provide an apparatus for reducing offset voltage drifts at the outputs of charge amplifier circuits.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention an apparatus for reducing offset voltage drifts in a charge amplifier circuit includes a charge amplifier circuit and a bias current compensation circuit. The bias current compensation circuit supplies bias current to lower any offset voltage drift at the output of the charge amplifier.

All features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the following detailed written description.

With reference now to there is illustrated a schematic diagram of a charge amplifier circuit in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown a charge amplifier circuit includes a piezoelectric sensor an operational amplifier a resistor and a capacitor . Charge amplifier circuit also includes a bias current compensation circuit having an operational amplifier resistors and capacitors . Within bias current compensation circuit a node VC tracks the voltage changes at output V due to DC offset and offset drift that are significantly below the cutoff frequency of a low pass filter formed by resistor and capacitors .

Any voltage change at node VC through negative feedback counteracts and limits the low frequency voltage change at output V. Thus any DC offset caused by input bias offset current will be attenuated by the loop gain 1 R R where R is the resistance of resistor and R is the resistance of resistor . The voltage level shifting of node VC causes most of the bias current to flow through resistor that has a much lower resistance value than that of resistor .

The offset voltage caused by an input bias current ib to operational amplifier flowing through resistor adds to the DC offset in output V but the total offset voltage due to the bias current ibwill be significantly less than that of charge amplifier circuit from . This is because the sum of resistances of resistors and is much less than the resistance of resistor . For example with resistors and having resistances 1.1 G 5.76 M and 5.76 M respectively the sum of resistances of resistors and is approximately 95 times less than the resistance of resistor .

If the cutoff frequency of a low pass filter formed by resistor and capacitors is significantly higher than the rate of change of input signals to operational amplifier then node VC will track the offset drift of the voltage at output V while supplying most of the input bias current ibfor operational amplifier via resistor . On the other hand if the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter formed by resistor and capacitors is significantly lower than the rate of change of input signals to operational amplifier then node VC will not change much in response to the input signals to operational amplifier and will not distort the output of operational amplifier .

Basically charge amplifier circuit becomes a second order high pass filter circuit after the addition of bias current compensation circuit . The low frequency cutoff of such high pass filter is slightly less than 1 2 RC where R is the resistance of resistor and C is the capacitance of capacitor and rolls off at a 40 dB per decade rate as the frequency of input signals to operational amplifier approaches zero.

With operational amplifier being a JFET device and resistor being in the gigaohm range input bias current ibat room temperature approximately 25 C. has roughly the same effect on DC offset as the offset voltage. At room temperature bias current compensation circuit only has a moderate effect on the total DC offset on charge amplifier circuit . But since the bias current in a JFET device doubles for every ten degree Celsius rise in temperature virtually all of the DC offset will be caused by the effect of input bias current at higher temperatures. At higher temperatures bias current compensation circuit can reduce the DC offset by a factor approaching the ratio of R1 R2 R3 where R is the resistance of resistor R is the resistance of resistor and R is the resistance of resistor .

The choice of values for the discrete components within bias current compensation circuit involves making a reasonable tradeoff among DC offset offset drift stability and noise gain. To ensure stability the total loop gain at the high pass filter cutoff frequency which is defined by resistor and capacitor must be less than 1 since the phase shifts from 90 to 180 at this point. In order to keep the loop gain less than 1 the attenuation of the low pass filter which is defined by resistor and capacitors must be greater than the gain introduced by R R where R is the resistance of resistor and R is the resistance of resistor . This places an upper limit on the high pass filter cutoff frequency which in turn limits the rate of offset drift that can be effectively canceled by bias current compensation circuit .

For charge amplifier circuit if the resistance R of resistor 1.1 G and the resistance R of resistor 5.76 M then R R 191. So the attenuation of the low pass filter should be at least 45.6 dB 1 191 at 2.1 Hz 1 2 RC where C is the capacitance of capacitor . The gain of the low pass filter at 2.1 Hz is 

The combination of resistors and acts as an amplifier for noise at the output of operational amplifier having a gain of R R. This places a lower limit on the value of resistor . The peak noise gain R R occurs at the cutoff frequency of the high pass filter formed by resistor and capacitor .

The value of the DC offset at the output V of operational amplifier is approximately equal to R2 ib R3 ib Vos Vos where ibis the bias current to operational amplifier ibis the bias current to operational amplifier Vosis the offset voltage of operational amplifier and Vosis the offset voltage of operational amplifier . So by reducing the resistances of resistors and both the DC offset and offset drift can be reduced but possibly at the expense of noise gain and or stability.

With reference now to there is depicted a chart illustrating offset voltage verses temperature for charge amplifier circuit from and charge amplifier circuit from . At 25 C. room temperature bias current compensation circuit only reduces the offset voltage by a factor of 6 because a large portion of the 250 V offset is caused by the offset voltage. At 100 C. bias current compensation circuit reduces the offset voltage from 400 mV to around 4 mV which is almost a 100 reduction.

As has been described the present invention provides an apparatus for reducing offset voltage drifts in a charge amplifier circuit.

While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
