The described embodiments generally relate to wireless communications devices and computer networks. More particularly the present disclosure relates to apparatus and methods for managing purchases between a group of mobile buyers on a wireless network and a seller.

Due to the ever increasing number of people with mobile access to communication networks mobile buyers using wireless communication devices present sellers with a large and relatively technically sophisticated buying community.

Wireless communication devices communicate packets including voice and data over a wireless network. Wireless devices are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers. These smart wireless devices such as cellular telephones have application programming interfaces APIs installed onto their local computer platform that allow software developers to create software applications that operate on the cellular telephone. The API sits between the wireless device system software and the software application making the cellular telephone functionality available to the application without requiring the software developer to have the specific cellular telephone system source code.

Although the purchasing of product or services by mobile buyers using their wireless communication devices is fairly common the various purchasing schemes currently offered are relatively simplistic and may not allow the buyer and seller many options. In many instances the product or service is simply downloaded upon demand to the buyer s device and the transaction including debiting the buyer and crediting the seller is managed by the carrier. In such circumstances where the seller has already made a substantial outlay of capital either to purchase product or to secure transmission bandwidth or facilities the seller may be at risk if a certain threshold of sales is not met.

In other purchasing schemes such as subscription services a buyer may be required to buy a subscription in advance to finance the delivery of a product or service at a set time in the future. However due to scheduling uncertainties many buyers are reluctant to pay in advance for a product or service for which they may unable to take delivery.

The disclosed embodiments provide apparatus and methods for managing purchases of content and services by mobile users using wireless communication devices on a wireless network.

Through the collective purchasing power of a large buyer community the overall contribution of the community may pay for a product or service that no individual on their own can likely afford. For instance the presentation of an event such as a sports event movie musical or play which would otherwise be uneconomical from both the standpoint of the seller and a single buyer may be possible by offering the product or service to a large buying community each buyer paying via a micro transaction a small portion of the overall cost and the seller fulfilling their portion of the transaction provided that a minimum response is generated.

In one embodiment a method of purchasing between mobile buyers and sellers comprises receiving a micro transaction message from a buyer s wireless communication device. The micro transaction message may comprise buyer information a product or service identifier and a micro payment amount the micro payment amount being a portion of a total predetermined requirement delivery of the product or service pending receipt of the total predetermined amount.

The method may further include accumulating the micro payment amount from one buyer with at least another micro payment amount and may further include generating purchase status messages to both the seller and the buyer. For example in one embodiment a contract fulfillment message may be generated and transmitted to the seller indicating that the accumulated payments meets or exceeds the total seller requirements for the purchase of the product service.

In another embodiment a computer readable medium embodying logic for mobile purchasing by a group of buyers and a seller may comprise at least one sequence of instructions wherein execution of the instructions by a community purchasing processor may cause the processor to perform the act of receiving a micro transaction message from a buyer s wireless communication device wherein the micro transaction message may include buyer information a product service identifier and a micro payment amount.

In yet another embodiment a computer server for managing transactions between a mobile buyer and a seller comprises a communications module to receive a micro transaction message from a buyer s wireless communication device the micro transaction message comprising buyer information a product or service identifier and a micro payment amount the micro payment amount being a portion of a predetermined total requirement to be received prior to delivery of the product or service. The server may include a micro transaction processing module operable to accumulate the micro payment amount with at least one other micro payment amount and to generate purchase status messages transmittable to the buyer and seller.

In another embodiment a method of purchasing product or services by a mobile buyer comprises receiving product service information on a buyer s wireless communication device from a source over a mobile portal across a wireless network. The product or service information may comprise an identification of the product service a per buyer cost and a predetermined total requirement required prior to delivering the product or service. The method further includes generating and transmitting a micro transaction message from the buyer s wireless communication device to a destination wherein the micro transaction message may include buyer information and a micro payment amount and a portion of the received product service information.

In yet another embodiment a computer readable data signal may be embodied in a carrier wave embodying logic for mobile purchasing by a group of buyers and sellers. The logic may comprise at least one sequence of instructions wherein execution of the instructions by processor in a wireless communication device may cause the processor to perform the act of receiving product or service information on a buyer s wireless communication device from a source over a mobile portal across a wireless network. The product or service information may include an identification of the product or service a predetermined total requirement required prior to delivering the product or service and a per buyer cost the per buyer cost being a portion of a total predetermined requirement. The embodying logic may further include transmitting a micro transaction message from the buyer s wireless communication device to a destination wherein the micro transaction message may include buyer information a micro payment amount and a portion of the received product or service information.

In still another embodiment a wireless communications device may comprise a computer platform further comprising a memory including a buyer client application software module downloaded to the memory across a wireless network from a source and a runtime environment operable to control the execution of the buyer client application module. The buyer client application module may include an identification of the product or service a per buyer cost and a predetermined total requirement required prior to delivering the product or service. The buyer client application module may be operable to generate and transmit a micro transaction message to a destination wherein the micro transaction message may include buyer information a micro payment amount and a portion of the received product service information.

Due to the ever increasing number of people with mobile access to communication networks mobile buyers equipped with wireless devices provide sellers with an ever expanding buying community with the technological means of transacting near real time transactions.

The following detailed description of exemplary embodiments is particularly directed to apparatus methods and computer readable media that provide for community based purchasing over a wireless network. Mobile buyers may partake in community based purchasing of products services that without the purchasing power of the community a single buyer would most likely be unable to purchase. Each purchase may be considered a micro transaction wherein a plurality of similar micro transactions generated from other mobile buyers may be accumulated by the system.

Such apparatus and methods may notify the seller when a predetermined total of micro payments is accumulated confirming to the seller that there is sufficient funds to proceed with product service delivery. Such apparatus and methods may also provide buyers with an alternative to subscription services wherein a mobile buyer may order a product or service on an ad hoc basis and the transaction completed if a predetermined number of micro transactions by like minded buyers is accumulated.

Furthermore in one exemplary embodiment a data element representing the number of buyer client applications requested and downloaded to interested mobile buyers may be accumulated and stored for further analysis by the seller. Further the community purchasing server may at step S generate and transmit a micro transaction received acknowledgment message to the buyer s device whereupon at step S the acknowledgment message is displayed on the buyer s device via output mechanism .

In one exemplary embodiment the micro transaction processing module may at step S determine that the seller s requirements have been met whereupon a contract fulfillment message may be generated and transmitted to the seller. In one embodiment the community purchasing server may not wait for contract fulfillment before updating the seller buyer with status information. For example the micro transaction processing module may download upon request and or periodically transmit a status message to the buyer and or the seller containing portions of product service data record .

As previously disclosed the seller s communication device may be any type of computerized wired or wireless device having a connection to a network . If the seller s device is a PC wired to the network the seller may communicate with the community purchasing server via a web browser or other PC based application. If the seller s device is a wireless device such as a cellular telephone the application download module may comprise a seller client application that may be downloaded onto the seller s wireless communication device . Similar to the buyer s wireless communication device the seller s device may include hardware and software modules operable to execute the seller client software .

Upon receipt of a contract fulfillment message generated at step S the seller may at step S acknowledge the fulfillment message and transmit a contract completion acknowledgment message to community purchasing server . The seller may then at step S initiate delivery of the product service to the community of mobile buyers .

Upon receiving the contract completion acknowledgment message bill processing may at step S be initiated by billing module and may include communicating with the escrow module to release the micro payments to the seller. In an alternate embodiment the billing module may at step S request confirmation of product service delivery before releasing escrowed funds to the seller. Confirmation of delivery may include communicating with the buyer client wireless communication device or may include communicating with a network carrier server not shown.

Additionally billing module may generate and transmit an invoice statement. For example in an embodiment where the community purchasing method comprises a method for downloading digital content to a buyer or viewing a live act billing module may generate an invoice that may include a balance payment due based on a purchase or a series of purchases by the mobile buyer. Such an invoice may be delivered electronically or by an alternate means of delivery.

Furthermore the billing module may incorporate mechanisms for handling refunds and return of product services . Such mechanisms include automated and operator controlled systems for generating return authorizations and crediting funds back to the mobile buyer.

In addition bill processing at step S may include transmitting a purchase completion message to the buyer s wireless communication device along with an authorization code . The authorization code may allow the mobile buyer to download or otherwise take possession of the product service . As disclosed above the buyer s wireless communication device may display various status messages and may display a message on the output mechanism indicating that the community purchase has been successfully completed.

Depending upon the product service the authorization code may be part of an authentication mechanism that may validate the identity of the buyer s wireless device and may also validate the micro transaction. In one embodiment product service may include content or data transferable to the wireless communication device across network the content including audio files video files software applications programs graphics access to live streaming data etc. downloadable directly to the buyer s wireless device . Where the purchased product is downloadable digital data the seller may verify the authorization code prior to releasing the digital content . The authentication mechanism may include but is not limited to a digital signature an encryption algorithm and a MAC.

In a further embodiment the seller may at any point prior to transmitting a contract completion acknowledgment message transmit a cancellation request message to the community purchasing server . The community purchasing server may upon receipt of the cancellation request message operate to return escrowed funds to the mobile buyer and may further operate to generate and transmit a cancellation message to the buyer s wireless communication device .

Depending upon the specific product service product service delivery at step S may require a delivery method other than downloading product to buyer wireless device . In one embodiment the product service may be a live act or portions of a live act which may be viewed in real time by the community of mobile buyers provided the predetermined seller requirements are met. In the case of a live act viewed by the mobile buyers it may be possible for mobile buyers by using the methods described herein to vote for or purchase certain events or outcomes particular to the live performance. Alternatively the product service may be a physical product requiring actual physical delivery.

It should be noted that the flowchart of the above discussed steps is but one example out of a plurality of viable sequences. Other sequences may be utilized for example where messages are omitted added or have different destinations such as in an embodiment where the separate modules of the community based purchasing server are separated into several units.

While the various disclosed embodiments have been illustrated and described it will be clear that the subject matter of this document is not limited to these embodiments only. For example although buyer client application module and media player module have been described as independent mechanisms they may be combined together or further separated in any fashion to perform the functions described above.

Additionally the application download module the micro transaction processing module the billing module and the seller s catalog may be separated and hosted by different servers or combined in any fashion. Numerous other modifications changes variations substitutions and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosed embodiments as described in the claims.

Also various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives modifications variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art and are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims.
