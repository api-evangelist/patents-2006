A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

This invention relates generally to a gaming system that incorporates a kiosk and more particularly to a system and methodology that integrates a kiosk having display screen into a gaming machine to provide kiosk functionality to players.

Traditionally gaming machines have been designed for gaming purposes only. In this regard gaming machines have been constructed only to include gaming functionality. Recently however casino owners have become aware that by adding additional features to gaming machines they may be able to maintain a player s attention to the gaming machines for longer periods of time. This in turn leads to the player wagering at the gaming machine for longer periods of time thereby increasing casino profits.

One technique that has been employed to maintain a player s attention at the gaming machine has been to provide players with access to gambling related information. By attaching a small electronic display to the gaming device gambling related information as well as news and advertisements can be sent to the player. The gambling related information may include for example information on sports betting and betting options for those sporting events. Additionally the gambling related information may also include information such as horse racing and off track betting. News and advertisements can also maintain a player s attention by providing the player with access to information ranging from show times to restaurant and hotel specials and to world events thus reducing the need and or desire for the player to leave the gaming machine.

Separately in many casino and non casino settings stand alone kiosks have been employed to perform specific functions. For example lottery ticket kiosks have become commonplace in commercial establishments in States that participate in intrastate and interstate lotteries. Both consumer and merchant usable lottery kiosks allow for purchase of lottery tickets and scratch off games. Kiosks have also been used to serve as stand alone automated teller machines ATMs where users can view account information transfer funds take out cash and make deposits. In grocery stores electronic coupons are available from in store kiosks. Kiosks are also used in airports to purchase airline tickets and automated check in.

It would be desirable to provide the player with interactive access to the above information. This type of interactivity would allow players significantly more flexibility to make use of the above described information. The gambling related information could also be utilized by the player in a much more efficient manner. In this regard greater levels of flexibility and access are likely to make a player remain and gamble at the gaming machine for significantly longer periods of time. Unfortunately the system components that are currently utilized for displaying and accessing this type of information such as external keypads and display modules are extremely limited in the functionality and capabilities that they provide thus limiting the breath and quality of information available to maintain the player s attention and keep him engaged at the game for longer periods of time.

As stated above attempts to distribute gambling related information advertisements and news of general interest to players has typically required additional system components to be attached to the gaming devices separately and apart from the construction of the gaming machine itself. Such components have generally included a keypad card reader and display equipment such as a 2 line LED display. Specifically these components for accessing and displaying information from gaming machines have been extremely limited in their usefulness because of the lack of capabilities Inherent in these components. In addition there is necessarily a limited space available in a gaming machine into which these components can be mounted. This serves to further limit their effectiveness. It would be desirable for new components capable of handling this expanded information transfer to be integrated into the gaming device itself. This would provide for a shareable mechanism with substantially greater functionality and extensibility than that which has been previously available.

Accordingly those skilled in the art have long recognized the need for a system that is capable of integrating expanded service and systems capabilities of one or more kiosks with the more traditional function of a gaming device. The claimed invention clearly addresses these and other needs.

Briefly and in general terms the claimed invention resolves the above and other problems by providing an embedded additional user interface configured as a kiosk for use in a gaming machine. More particularly an embedded kiosk is incorporated into a gaming machine cabinet. The gaming machine includes a gaming presentation and gaming processor. The embedded additional user interface includes a web content capable display screen wherein the display screen presents web information to a user via the display screen. An embedded processor is included that employs an internal operating system. The embedded processor reads incoming kiosk data from one or more kiosk servers connected to a gaming network translates the data into a web protocol if necessary and maps the data to the web content capable display screen. The web content capable display provides kiosk operations in addition to a gaming experience.

In accordance with another aspect of a preferred embodiment the kiosk operations include by way of example and not by way of limitation using player account enrollment and rewards services viewing of casino player account standings viewing of account status and history redeeming of payout tickets redeeming of promotional or complimentary awards requesting help or service from an attendant ordering drinks making dinner reservations reserving taxis purchasing show tickets conducting banking transactions buying lottery tickets providing coin in coin out information displaying malfunction conditions displaying jackpots displaying tilt conditions displaying a game software version conducting bank account maintenance ordering products redeeming coupons making hotel reservations or making electronic funds transfers.

The display screen of the embedded additional user interface is preferably a color graphic touch screen display. Preferably the embedded processor is at least a 32 bit processor. Further the internal operating system of the embedded additional user interface is preferably customized to match the specific hardware to which the internal operating system attaches.

In accordance with another aspect of a preferred embodiment the embedded processor utilizes cryptographic technology. In one preferred embodiment a certification process is provided for authentication and non repudiation of the kiosk data. Preferably the certification process provides audit ability and traceability. Specifically the certification process provides sufficient security for kiosk server operators to design their own content.

In accordance with another aspect of a preferred embodiment the kiosk data uses web protocol. In another preferred embodiment HTML is the web protocol. In another preferred embodiment the web protocol is JAVASCRIPT . In still another preferred embodiment XML is the web protocol. In yet another preferred embodiment MACROMEDIA FLASH animation technology is the web protocol. In one preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface connects to an Ethernet networked backbone. Further in one preferred embodiment the kiosk connects to a web server through an Ethernet networked backbone.

In another preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface includes an animation capable display screen and an embedded processor. In yet another preferred embodiment the kiosk includes a web page display screen and an embedded processor. In still another preferred embodiment the kiosk includes a multimedia display screen and an embedded processor.

In accordance with another preferred embodiment the claimed invention is directed towards a gaming machine that includes an embedded kiosk having a display screen. Preferably the gaming machine includes a gaming display screen a gaming processor and an embedded additional user interface. The embedded additional user interface further includes a display screen and an embedded processor that has been described above.

In accordance with another preferred embodiment the claimed invention is directed towards a method for providing kiosk operations in a gaming machine via an additional user interface that is incorporated into the gaming machine cabinet wherein the additional user interface includes an additional processor and a web page display screen. The method includes receiving a data message containing kiosk data through a communication bus in the additional user interface translating the data message into a web authoring language if necessary and mapping the data message to the web page display screen wherein the display screen presents kiosk data to a user via the display screen.

Other features and advantages of the claimed invention will become apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the features of the claimed invention.

A preferred embodiment of the embedded additional user interface constructed in accordance with the claimed invention is directed towards the integration of an embedded additional user interface into a gaming machine to increase user excitement by providing a richer gaming experience. The embedded additional user interface provides enhanced player satisfaction and excitement as well as improved gaming device reliability interactivity flexibility security and accountability. The user interface is sometimes referred to herein as additional in that the user interface is separate from the gaming screen or other gaming presentation . Further the user interface is sometimes referred to herein as embedded in that the user interface includes its own processor in some preferred embodiments of the invention.

Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals denote like or corresponding parts throughout the drawings and more particularly to there is shown one embodiment of an embedded additional user interface . Specifically shows an embedded additional user interface that includes a web page display screen and an embedded processor . The user interface is incorporated into a gaming machine that in turn includes a gaming screen and or non screen gaming region e.g. spinning reels or other gaming presentation gaming processor and a game monitoring unit . The embedded processor employs an internal operating system and communicates with the gaming processor preferably via the game monitoring unit . The embedded processor reads incoming data translates the data into a web authoring language and maps the data to the web page display screen . The display screen presents web page information to a user via the display screen thereby increasing user excitement by providing a richer gaming experience. The game monitoring unit monitors the information that is input through the user interface . This provides a dramatic improvement over traditional system components that have been used as in the past to provide user information. The user interface communicates with the game monitoring unit in the same manner as the previous system components communicated with the game monitoring unit.

As shown in prior art gaming devices typically utilized a single video display screen as a gaming screen for the gaming machine while additional system components were attached or juxtaposed next to the gaming machine. The display may comprise for example a 2 line 20 character VF Vacuum Fluorescent display . An input device may comprise a 12 digit keypad .

However referring again to in a preferred embodiment of the claimed invention the system components that were used in prior art systems are replaced with the embedded additional user interface to provide the advanced functionality of a web page display screen . Such functionality includes by way of example only and not by way of limitation the ability to display animation multimedia and other web type content. The embedded additional user interface enables presentation of additional information e.g. enhanced player information to a player or potential player through the web page display screen in an exciting eye catching format while not interfering with the normal gaming processes being displayed on the gaming screen . Further the embedded additional user interface does not interfere with the normal gaming hardware in the gaming machine but rather is easily integrated into a gaming machine .

In situations involving multiple gaming machine or gaming component manufacturers an embedded additional user interface can be incorporated into a gaming machine either originally or by retrofitting without requiring access to the game logic or other gaming systems that might be proprietary and inaccessible with a gaming machine from another gaming manufacturer. Thus in a preferred embodiment of the claimed invention the embedded additional user interface which includes a web page display screen for presenting supplementary information to a player is incorporated into a gaming machine in addition to the standard gaming screen typically found in a gaming machine. The embedded additional user interface may also be incorporated into a gaming machine that utilizes a gaming region e.g. a reel spinner instead of a standard gaming screen . This supplemental information may include general gaming information player specific information player excitement and interest captivation content advertising content targeted or otherwise and the like. Further in other preferred embodiments the embedded additional user interface may have the ability to interact with the game logic of the gaming processor preferably via the game monitoring unit and thus provide further functionality such as bonus games system games and or the ability to incorporate awards promotional offers or gifts from the web page display screen to the gaming screen . Moreover the web page display screen may display supplemental information in an attract mode when there is no game play occurring. Also the gaming processor may use the web page display screen to present casino employees with a web based dialogue to facilitate gaming machine configuration and event investigation activities without disturbing the gaming screen region .

In a preferred embodiment of the claimed invention the embedded additional user interface is used to make casino services more accessible and friendly to casino patrons. In one preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface is designed to interface with the hardware configuration of game platforms currently employed in an existing gaming communication systems network thus decreasing implementation costs for the casino. A standard gaming network interface to the systems network such as a Mastercom system includes a multi drop bus method of communicating to a keypad and display. The Mastercom system is available from Bally Manufacturing and is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 429 361 to Raven et al. incorporated herein by reference. One such currently utilized bus is an EPI Enhanced Player Interface which uses an industry standard IC bus and signaling. Other gaming systems use an RS232 bus and signaling.

In one preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface is used to replace upgrade an EPI. Preferably the embedded additional user interface replaces the EPI of the gaming machine in a plug and play manner. In other words the old EPI can be unplugged and the new embedded additional user interface can simply be plugged into the IC bus of the game monitoring unit in the gamming machine . The user interface utilizes the currently employed industry standard IC bus and signaling without requiring any further modification. The embedded processor of the embedded additional user interface reads incoming IC data content translates the data into a web authoring language e.g. HTML DHTML XML MACROMEDIA FLASH and maps the data to the web page display screen . In this manner the previous IC data messages which were typically presented on a 2 line 20 character VF display are automatically transformed by the embedded additional user interface into an attention grabbing animated multimedia web page style format. This results in enhanced player satisfaction and excitement with extremely minimal retrofitting requirements. In one preferred embodiment a physical layer and transport layer use customer message layer signaling to transform the IC messages.

Since in one preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface utilizes IC hardware and signaling this enables the user interface to speak and understand the IC protocol message set and thus communicate with the GMU which communicates with the gaming processor of the gaming machine or other similarly networked devices in the same fashion in which the gaming processor previously communicated over an EPI or RS232 bus. Accordingly in a preferred embodiment of the claimed invention the functionality of the previously utilized hardware e.g. the EPI can be replaced or augmented and thus substantially upgraded with the integration of the embedded additional user interface into the gaming machine . As such the limitations placed upon the gaming processor by the low function external hardware of such system components e.g. a keypad and a 2 line 20 character VF display may be eliminated.

As stated above in one preferred embodiment the incoming data received by the embedded additional user interface is IC signaling protocol however in other preferred embodiments other serial communication protocols or electronic communication format may be utilized. Preferably the embedded processor communicates with the gaming processor via the game monitoring unit and or other connected devices over an IC bus or over another serial communications bus in embodiments that utilize another protocol . The web page display screen of the embedded additional user interface is preferably a color graphic touch screen display. Preferably the embedded processor is at least a 32 bit processor. A preferred embodiment utilizes a 32 bit processor because cryptographic techniques such as SHA 1 or better and DSA algorithms are written and operate natively on a 32 bit system. Additionally the Microsoft Windows environment which is utilized in some preferred embodiments of the claimed invention is also 32 bit. Further the internal operating system of the embedded additional user interface may be adapted or customized to match the specific communication bus hardware used by the devices in the gaming machine to which the internal operating system communicates.

Preferably the embedded additional user interface is an embedded computer board that in addition to the embedded processor and the web page display screen further includes a removable COMPACT FLASH card or other memory storage device as shown in and a network adapter port. Content and feature updates to the embedded additional user interface are accomplished by physically swapping out the COMPACT FLASH card or other memory storage device . Thus in order to retrieve data from the embedded additional user interface the data is accessed by physically removing and reading the COMPACT FLASH card . In other embodiments as described below updates may be provided by direct or peer to peer downloading over a network.

In one preferred embodiment the internal operating system utilized by the embedded processor of the embedded additional user interface is WINDOWS CE version 4.2 or higher . Preferably the embedded additional user interface is built upon a PXA255 based board developed by the Kontron Corporation. Additionally in a preferred embodiment of the embedded additional user interface the browser control for the web page display screen is MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER 6.0 or higher which is shipped standard with WINDOWS CE 4.2 the preferred internal operating system for the embedded processor .

A preferred embodiment of the embedded additional user interface also provides a mechanism for inputting system information into and retrieving system information from the game machine . As stated above the embedded additional user interface preferably uses industry standard IC hardware and signaling. The IC protocol has multi master capabilities. For example and not by way of limitation each IC device is capable of participating as both a slave and as a master. The embedded additional user interface enables system information such as information input by a player into a web page display screen to be sent from the game machine to a slot system network or to another destination location . Likewise the embedded additional user interface also enables the system information such as display messages to be sent from the systems network or from another source location to the game machine for viewing by the player through the web page display screen .

In a preferred embodiment information can also be input by a user into the web page display screen of the user interface . The web page display screen of the user interface employs a virtual keypad. Further the user interface uses a keypad dictionary that allows a user to be able to enter a vastly greater amount of information than was previously possible using a 12 digit VF keypad. For example the virtual key on the touch screen that is displayed by the browser is pressed by a user. This calls the Keypad object by calling its Dispatch interface with a string that identifies which virtual key was pressed. The Keypad object looks up the string in the Dictionary object which has been loaded at initialization time with a set of keys to return when that string is passed to it. When it retrieves this set of zero or more key characters it passes them to the GMU by calling the interface exposed by the object.

Typically a network interface or equivalent system is used to control the flow of funds used with the gaming machine within a particular casino. By utilizing the embedded additional user interface of the claimed invention the gaming network interface can be instructed to move funds between player s accounts and gaming devices by merely touching the web page display screen . In addition many other more sophisticated commands and instructions may be provided. Thus the embedded additional user interface improves the player and casino employee interface to the gaming machine directly at the gaming device itself.

In a preferred embodiment of the claimed invention the web page display screen of the embedded additional user interface enables a player to be shown player messages in an animated multimedia web content style environment. These messages would previously have been displayed in a significantly more mundane format on a separate display device e.g. a 2 line VF display device . In some preferred embodiments touch screen buttons in the web page display screen are used by the player to navigate between windows in web page display screen and allow access to system functions such as cashless withdraw balance requests system requests points redemption and the like. In other preferred embodiments of the claimed invention the web page display screen utilizes various other data input techniques commonly known in the art instead of the touch screen data entry. Thus implementation of the embedded additional user interface is an efficient highly beneficial and substantial upgrade to a gaming machine that greatly increases the functionality over what was previously possible using an EPI.

In one preferred embodiment text data messages are translated into web page navigation requests by the embedded processor and then displayed on the web page display screen as shown and discussed with respect to below. Script languages such as JAVA SCRIPT and VB SCRIPT are also utilized for some of the web pages. Preferably the embedded additional user interface emulates the 12 digit keypad and the 2 20 VF display on the web page display screen which has touch screen capabilities. In this embodiment commands that were previously displayed on the 2 20 VF display are matched to a corresponding URL and a browser is used to render the page on the web page display screen . The web pages displayed contain touch screen keys that effectively emulate hardware keys.

With reference to in one preferred embodiment of the claimed invention a dictionary URL approach is used for translating the data messages into web page information. In this manner data messages are looked up in a dictionary data file where they can be redirected to an attractive URL. The embedded processor responds to requests on the IC bus that were intended for the prior art enhanced player interface EPI VF display. The web page display screen is not a passive display device like traditional PC monitors but rather the display screen must respond to commands with text type responses. These requests include initialization requests status requests and display requests. With reference to as each text data message to be displayed is passed into the embedded processor the processor calls a URL Dictionary to look up a URL with which to replace the text data message. Once the substitution is complete the embedded processor instructs the web page display screen to present or navigate to the appropriate web page.

Accordingly with reference to a URL Dictionary component is used to map a text string sent from the embedded processor and intended for the display on the 2 20 VF display to a URL that can be used to display a much more visually enhanced graphical representation of the same message. Thus the URL Dictionary component contains a listing of the possible text messages to be supported that could be sent from the embedded processor and a mapping to a set of the desired eye catching web content to be displayed on the web page display screen . In this event that a message is not in the URL Dictionary such a message is mapping to a page that substitutes for the 2 line mode.

In the preferred embodiments described above the embedded processor of the embedded additional user interface reads incoming IC data messages translates the IC data messages into a web authoring language e.g. HTML DHTML XML MACROMEDIA FLASH and maps the newly translated web page data message to the web page display screen . Additionally the embedded additional user interface can also read incoming data messages that are already in a web authoring language e.g. HTML DHTML XML MACROMEDIA FLASH and map this web page data to the web page display screen . Further and highly advantageously a preferred embodiment of the claimed invention also allows casinos that are using the embedded additional user interface to design and use their own content thereby giving the casinos the ability to decide what the web page presented on the web page display screen of the user interface will look like.

Referring now to in this preferred embodiment content may be locally downloaded. Specifically in one preferred embodiment the content is updated through a physical USB or other connection that is used to download the new content. In one preferred embodiment the data on the COMPACT FLASH card can be accessed by connecting a separate computer to the network adapter port of the embedded additional user interface . This embodiment allows updating the contents of the operating system changing the operating system itself and receiving data from the Compact Flash card . Physical removal of the COMPACT FLASH card is also still be an option for update and inspection of files on the embedded additional user interface .

In one preferred embodiment a portable computer is used to store and publish data content to the COMPACT FLASH card on the embedded additional user interface as well as to receiving data from the COMPACT FLASH card on the embedded additional user interface. In this embodiment all content on the embedded additional user interface is authenticated as if it were a gaming machine.

In another preferred embodiment a network adapter port is provided on the embedded computer board of the user interface . This embodiment also includes a boot loader. Further in this embodiment the portable computer described above includes components for use in uploading data to and downloading data from the COMPACT FLASH card on the embedded additional user interface . Specifically the components that run on the portable computer are for moving new data content to the embedded additional user interface and for validation and verification of the data content that is on the embedded additional user interface. Preferably all data that is used to update the COMPACT FLASH card moves to or from the embedded additional user interface over the single built in network adapter port on the board.

Prior to the advent of the embedded additional user interface of the claimed invention gaming regulators would have been unwilling to allow casino operators to design their own content. However due to the cryptographic technology implemented by the embedded processor in the embedded additional user interface a certification process is provided by the claimed invention with sufficient security for gaming regulators to allow casino operators to design their own content. Specifically in one preferred embodiment the certification process offered ensures authentication and non repudiation of the casino operator designed web content. Preferably in the claimed invention the certification process provided further ensures auditability and traceability. Various cryptographic technologies such as authentication and non repudiation described herein below are utilized in preferred embodiments of the claimed invention to provide sufficient security for gaming regulators to allow casino operators to design their own content.

In one preferred embodiment this certification process is used to certify signed content created by the casino owners in the same manner that a signed program is certified. Preferably PKI Public Key Infrastructure is utilized in the certification process. PKI is a system of digital certificates Certificate Authorities and other registration authorities that verify authenticity and validity. In one preferred embodiment a new tier or second PKI is created that is rooted in the primary PKI and that leverages the capabilities of the certificate e.g. a x509 certificate that allow for limited access. Thus this preferred embodiment allows the attributes within the certificate to be used to provide levels of code access and acceptance in the gaming industry.

In one embodiment the content is protected by digital signature verification using DSA Digital Signature Algorithm or RSA Rivest Shamir Adleman technology. In this regard the content is preferably protected using digital signature verification so that any unauthorized changes are easily identifiable. A digital signature is the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature in that it binds an individual s identity to a piece of information. A digital signature scheme typically consists of a signature creation algorithm and an associated verification algorithm. The digital signature creation algorithm is used to produce a digital signature. The digital signature verification algorithm is used to verify that a digital signature is authentic i.e. that it was indeed created by the specified entity . In another embodiment the content is protected using other suitable technology.

In one preferred embodiment a Secure Hash Function 1 SHA 1 is used to compute a 160 bit hash value from the data content or firmware contents. This 160 bit hash value which is also called an abbreviated bit string is then processed to create a signature of the game data using a one way private signature key technique called Digital Signature Algorithm DSA . The DSA uses a private key of a private key public key pair and randomly or pseudo randomly generated integers to produce a 320 bit signature of the 160 bit hash value of the data content or firmware contents. This signature is stored in the database in addition to the identification number. In other preferred embodiments higher level Secure Hash Functions are used such as SHA 256 or SHA 512.

In another preferred embodiment the claimed invention utilizes a Message Authentication Code MAC . A Message Authentication Code is a specific type of message digest in which a secret key is included as part of the fingerprint. Whereas a normal digest consists of a hash data the MAC consists of a hash key data . Thus a MAC is a bit string that is a function of both data either plaintext or ciphertext and a secret key. A Message Authentication Code is attached to data in order to allow data authentication. Further a MAC may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message. Typically a Message Authentication Code MAC is a one way hash function that takes as input both a symmetric key and some data. A symmetric key algorithm is an algorithm for cryptography that uses the same cryptographic key to encrypt and decrypt the message.

A Message Authentication Code can be generated faster than using digital signature verification technology however a Message Authentication Code is not as robust as digital signature verification technology. Thus when speed of processing is critical the use of a Message Authentication Code provides an advantage because it can be created and stored more rapidly than digital signature verification technology.

In one preferred embodiment the authentication technique utilized is a BKEY electronic key device. A BKEY is an electronic identifier that is tied to a particular individual. In this manner any adding accessing or modification of content that is made using a BKEY for authentication is linked to the specific individual to which that BKEY is associated. Accordingly an audit trail is thereby established for regulators and or other entities that require this kind of data or system authentication.

Another preferred embodiment of the verification system utilizes component bindings for verification using cryptographic security. In component binding some components come equipped with unalterable serial numbers. Additionally components such as web content or the game cabinet may also be given another random identification number by the owner. Other components in the system such as the CMOS memory in the motherboard the hard drive and the non volatile RAM are also issued random identification numbers. When all or some of these numbers are secured together collectively in a grouping this protected grouping is referred to as a binding. Each component of the machine contains its portion of the binding.

In one such preferred embodiment every critical log entry made to the content is signed with a Hashed Message Authorization Code HMAC that is based on the entry itself and on the individual binding codes. In this manner the security produced by the bindings ensures that log entries that are made cannot be falsified or repudiated.

After the critical gaming and or system components are selected given individual identifiers and combined into a protected grouping that is secured using the component bindings any changes to those components will then be detected authorized and logged. For example content within the binding is digitally signed SHA 1 or better using the key derived from the bindings. This signature is verified whenever an entry is made to a component within the binding. If the signature is wrong this security violation and the violator are noted but typically the entry is not prohibited. In other embodiments the entry may be prohibited as well. Thus the component binding produces a cryptographic audit trail of the individuals making changes to any of the components within the binding.

Moreover bindings ensure that the critical components of a gaming machine system or the content utilized therein that have been selected to be components within the binding have not been swapped or altered in an unauthorized manner. Preferably bindings use unique identification numbers that are assigned to vital parts of the gaming platform including by way of example only and not by way of limitation the cabinet motherboard specific software non volatile RAM card content data and hard drive. These identification numbers combine in a cryptographic manner to form a binding that protects and virtually encloses the included components such that no component within the binding can be modified removed or replaced without creating an audit trail and requiring authentication. Thus for one of these components within the binding to be changed appropriate authentication is required and a log file entry is made documenting the activity and the identity of the individual making the change. In one preferred embodiment a specific level of BKEY clearance or classification is required to make specific changes.

Referring now to in one preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface connects to an Ethernet networked backbone instead of a local system network. Currently casino networks are not Ethernet but rather are smaller more simplistic local system networks. Thus in this Ethernet networked backbone embodiment the current system network is replaced by an industry standard Ethernet backbone such as 10 100 base T Ethernet running over Cat 3 4 5 6 or higher. Thus a standard 10 100 base T Ethernet card is added to the embedded processor in this embodiment. Preferably the network employs TCP IP HTTP and XML messaging or a variant of XML. Nevertheless any suitable protocol may be used.

Further in another preferred embodiment the embedded additional user interface connects to a full featured back end download configuration server through the above described Ethernet networked backbone as shown in . In such an embodiment the full featured server can schedule downloads of content gaming or otherwise as well as upload information from the gaming machines such as what options the gaming machines currently possess. Accordingly in a preferred embodiment the primary use of the server is as data download and data retrieval server. While this server does upload and download web content style information it is typically not connected to the World Wide Web. This server must be authenticated just like a gaming machine to make the content served to the embedded additional user interface acceptable to the gaming regulators. Preferably utilization of the Ethernet networked backbone and the server provides many system benefits including but not limited to reliability maintainability security content staging content testing deployment procedures and incident recovery. In one embodiment deliverables also preferably include content templates and guidelines for casino owners and operators to create their own web content for deployment to the web server. In one embodiment the web server has its content authenticated in the same manner as the embedded additional user interface to allow content to be downloaded to the web page display screen .

Referring now to in another preferred embodiment of the claimed invention the functions previously performed by the gaming monitoring unit as shown in of the gaming machine are supported by the embedded processor of the embedded additional user interface . Otherwise stated the GMU code is transitioned from the gaming monitoring unit into the embedded processor in the embedded additional user interface . Accordingly such a configuration removes the need for the gaming monitoring unit in the gaming machine . This results in a significant reduction in the amount and complexity of the hardware as well as completing a phased transition of more traditional style gaming machines into more modernized upgraded gaming machines.

Thus in such a preferred embodiment the claimed invention is directed towards an embedded additional user interface that is incorporated into a gaming machine the gaming machine in turn including a gaming screen or other appropriate gaming region e.g. spinning reels but does not include a gaming monitoring unit . Such an embedded additional user interface still includes a web content capable display screen and an embedded processor . Once again the web content capable display screen presents web information to a user via the display screen. The embedded processor preferably utilizes an internal operating system. Furthermore in this embodiment the embedded processor additionally includes standard gaming monitoring unit functionality GMU code since it replaces the gaming monitoring unit in the gaming machine . As before the embedded processor reads incoming data translates the data into a web protocol web authoring language if necessary and maps the data to the web content capable display screen .

In one embodiment the embedded additional user interface the messages are flashed e.g. animation multimedia and the like to the player within the web page display screen while the gaming screen is used for game play. These web page style messages can be set at virtually any desired length format or style. A message might display for example Welcome to Harrah s Las Vegas You have 1200 bonus points. Would you like to make a hotel or dinner reservation Importantly while a previous utilized EPI would only been capable of scrolling this message in one quarter inch 0.25 tall monochrome text in contrast the web page display screen would flash this message in bright red white black and green animated format on six inch 6.0 by three inch 3.0 color graphic display. Additionally in some embodiments inserting a player identification card into a card reader and or selecting a player services button activates additional player services functionality.

In one embodiment the embedded additional user interface which operates as a user interface UI or terminal includes a video display that is equipped with a touch screen and audio device. In this embodiment the embedded additional user interface provides the gaming machine with the capability of executing applications from one or more web servers as well as enabling the execution of the gaming machine s local applications simultaneously. For example in one embodiment the gaming machine contains an interactive local player tracking and game management system unit but also executes a back end casino management application located on a back end server. Further in one embodiment the UI comprises a touch controlled web browser that renders information from the local gaming machine and interconnected web servers thereby providing the user with 1 game data 2 local player session data and 3 back end casino management data in a single interface. For example in one embodiment each of these types of data includes coin in derivative data for the player the coin in derivatives for the game the coin in derivatives for the player session and the coin in derivative for that player for one or more casinos. The coin in and bonus status based on the coin in for each of these types of data can be displayed each in different screen regions or in the same screen region if desired.

In one embodiment the game data includes the output for playing a game including a game that executes locally within the gaming machine or a network game such as a progressive game or peer to peer game. The local session data includes data related to a player s use of the gaming machine from the time the player first began play on the gaming machine. In some cases the local session data determines whether a player is eligible for bonuses as a result of game play during a session. For example in one embodiment the player is given a free play of a hand of electronic poker if 25 hands were played in the last hour. In another embodiment a bonus game is associated with a player s play on a gaming machine during prior sessions to attract particular players back to gaming machines they have played .

The back end casino management data allows global bonusing or system gaming . In one embodiment a bonus or system game is awarded based on all prior play by the player within a casino or all play within several casinos. Whether based on 1 game data 2 local player session data and or 3 back end casino management data a player s eligibility for a variety of system games may be accessed simultaneously from the single user interface.

In one embodiment system gaming is based on one or any combination of the following 1 data collected regarding games played on the local gaming machine by any number of players or all players 2 back end casino management data collected regarding games played by one player anywhere in the casino and or 3 back end casino management data collected regarding games played by several players or all players in a casino or two or more casinos. For example with regard to game play on the local gaming machine in one embodiment a bonus is triggered after a threshold coin in on the gaming machine is met whether the coin in amount is from one player or several players who have played games on the gaming machine . In another embodiment back end casino data is collected through the network from many gaming machines played by a player. The data includes coin in data to compare against a threshold to determine whether one or more bonuses should be awarded to the player who is identified using a player ID card that is swiped or inserted into the gaming machine during game play.

In another embodiment back end casino data collected through the network from many gaming machines includes coin in data to compare against a threshold to determine whether one or more bonuses should be awarded at one or more of the gaming machines.

In another embodiment the game data and or backend casino data includes yield management data. In one embodiment the yield management data includes projection data calculated based on one or more factors related to use of one or more gaming machines. For example in one embodiment the yield management data includes game play projection data machine usage projection data and or income projection data calculated based historical game play data for the one or more gaming machines. In one embodiment the calculations are performed using linear regression analysis. In another embodiment the calculations are performed using a neural network. In one embodiment yield management data is used to determine one or more bonuses or the play characteristics of a system game. The embedded user interface facilitates presenting this back end casino or casino management data directly at the gaming machine .

With reference to in one embodiment the UI is within the embedded additional user interface that provides a server client interface with kiosk functionality and serves as an embedded kiosk by which the embedded additional user interface will be referred to interchangeably herein. Kiosks are traditionally stand alone machines that provide gaming and non gaming related services. Kiosks may include both patron oriented services and maintenance oriented features. In one embodiment patron oriented services include the ability to sign on to player account enrollment and rewards services view casino player account standings view account status and history redeem payout tickets redeem promotional or complimentary awards request help or service from an attendant order drinks make dinner reservations reserve taxis purchase show tickets conduct banking transactions buy lottery tickets and the like. Maintenance oriented features include providing information such as coin in coin out malfunction conditions jackpots tilt conditions game software version and the like. Other non gaming related kiosk functions include bank account maintenance product ordering coupon redemption hotel reservations electronic funds transfers and the like.

To provide such kiosk functionality in one embodiment the embedded kiosk comprises the equivalent of a small personal computer PC in tablet form. In one embodiment the Gateway M275 Series by Gateway Inc. of San Diego Calif. is a notebook PC that is operable as a Tablet PC and can be used to implement the additional embedded user interface . A touch screen is included in such a system. In one embodiment the processor and memory storage device and other computer electronics are contained in a thin casing behind the touch screen . The touch screen obviates the need for a separate keypad or keyboard which can be virtualized on the screen . In one embodiment the Windows XP operating system available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. operates the embedded kiosk . In another embodiment when a smaller interface is required a personal digital assistant PDA such as the Palm Pilot available from Palm Computing Inc. of Santa Clara Calif. is used instead of a tablet PC. Such PDAs are also capable of executing one or more versions of the Windows Operating System including Windows CE with a web browser built in.

The embedded kiosk functions are provided from one or more servers through the gaming network. Tablet PCs and now many PDAs such as the Palm Pilot typically contain or have available one or more built in networking connections to the Ethernet network which may either comprise a hard wired connection or an 802.11x wi fi or wireless connection. Although other network typologies may be used the present wide spread availability of Ethernet technology provides an easy networking solution for the system. Security for a wi fi enabled system is provided as discussed below.

With reference back to in one embodiment the Ethernet network comprises a peer to peer network connecting multiple devices. Off the shelf networking equipment may be used for the network such as the Netgear Double 108 Mbps Firewall Router Model WGU624 available from Netgear Inc. of Santa Clara Calif. Such networking systems typically provide plug in play PnP installation for the current Windows series of operating system versions. The peer to peer type network allows a network to forward information from one machine to another without the need for a connection at one central location to distribute data in the network.

While Ethernet technology began as a collision detection bus network in most modern Ethernet platforms a concentrator is used in a star type network structure with physical lines to each node on the network. Nevertheless peer to peer networking is still practiced in Ethernet networks wherein one node forwards or sends data to another node which can send the data to yet another node. In this fashion updates may be perpetuated through the network without using a central server to arbitrate the transfer. The Microsoft Windows Network is an example of a peer to peer network that can use Ethernet technology for the physical network. True physical peer to peer networks that can also be used with the invention include token ring and the peer to peer networking built into currently sold PC systems by the Apple Computer Corporation. Nevertheless whether the physical network layer is true peer to peer the operating system layer and application layer may send and receive data in true peer to peer fashion over the network from one node to another without regard to whether a central server is involved or not.

In one embodiment the Internet connection comprises an add on or built in Ethernet port in the back of the embedded additional user interface . In another embodiment the Internet connection comprises a wi fi connection built directly into the embedded additional user interface using for example Intel Centrino technology. Current wi fi security systems such as Wired Equivalent Privacy WEP or Wi Fi Protected Access WPA security may be used to secure the wireless connection. In another embodiment wireless technology is not used by the embedded additional user interface of the claimed invention.

Preferably an audio device is included with the embedded additional user interface . In one embodiment the audio device comprises an upgraded sound system such as a stereo set of PC compatible speakers linked to a sound card in the tablet PC type of embedded additional user interface . The audio device is used as a secondary sound system that projects audio signals provided only by the embedded additional user interface with the underlying gaming machine having a separate sound system . However in one embodiment the audio signals produced by the underlying gaming machine and the embedded additional user interface are combined by the embedded additional user interface for presentation by the audio device . In another embodiment the embedded additional user interface provides its audio signals back to the underlying gaming machine for presentation by the native sound system . In other embodiments additional user interface devices are included for example and not by way of limitation cameras and biometric sensors that can be used for user identification in kiosk functions that require use of these interface devices for security.

In another embodiment only one audio device or is used. An audio switch is used to present audio signals from the gaming processor and kiosk . In one embodiment the audio switch is a transistor switch that serially presents the signals from the gaming machine and the kiosk without mixing the audio signals.

Bi directional communication between the gamming processor of the underlying gaming machine and the kiosk is accomplished using a variety of methods including but not limited to using a USB connection or hub . In another embodiment communication between the host gaming processor and the kiosk is provided through an Ethernet connection . For older gaming machines that may not support USB technology an RS232 or parallel connection with a null modem crossover send receive wire may be used for bidirectional communications.

In one embodiment the kiosk related functions are provided from one or several network devices such as servers that are connected to the network with one or more of the servers having a connection through a wide area network . For example and not by way of limitation one or more of the network servers includes a lottery server that is operated by state lottery officials. The lottery server for example provides the same data communication to the embedded kiosk that is provided to standard lottery kiosks found for example in grocery stores and the like. Another server comprises for example and not by way of limitation an airline reservation server for selling airline tickets as found in some airports. The same data communication is provided to the embedded kiosk as is provided to airport kiosks. In this regard the imbedded kiosk serves as mutli function kiosk connected to one or more servers serving kiosk functions to the imbedded kiosk . In one embodiment users are presented with a menu of choices on the touch screen for which of the kiosk functions are desired.

In some embodiments the wide area network comprises the Internet with the server connected to the network through one or more secure virtual private networks VPN pipes. Thus the embedded kiosk and game machine have access to the VPN servers and also other non secure devices such as Internet web servers serving game and or kiosk functions.

In one embodiment the execution in each kiosk function can occur in a separate browser window simultaneously with other kiosk functions. Each kiosk function is implemented as a separate execution of a browser program or instance of a browser program such as the Microsoft Internet Explorer or the Netscape browser. Each of these browser applications provide the capability of executing HTML XML Java and other browser compatible kiosk functions within an autonomous browser instance while allowing if desired interaction between the browser instances . For example kiosk data for one browser window for hotel reservations can be integrated with kiosk data for another browser window for flight reservations to automatically fill in travel and hotel stay dates and the like.

Referring for example to Internet Explorer for the purpose of explanation when an HTML web page or other browser displayable data is received an intermediate receptor provides the data stream to a connection management system to provide the data to the proper application window. A well known example of such a system is the Winsock system in the Windows environment.

Using Winsock when a client such as the kiosk in the embodiment of accesses a server it opens a connection to the server using the TCP IP protocol. A first step in opening this communication requires the central processing unit to open a socket. The sockets system also called Berkeley sockets is part of the Winsock protocol which is an application programming interface API commonly used to access the Internet. Generally to open a socket three steps are taken. A socket is first allocated. Next a socket is bound to a local address that identifies the client and client window executing the relevant application. The socket is then associated with the IP address of the host which may be a remote server or local host e.g. gaming machine . Data is received and sent receive and send calls between the client and host as needed according to HTTP FTP or whatever communication protocol is required to download the page.

Several sockets can be opened at the same time. For example each instance of a browser kiosk window running a kiosk operation opens a socket to exchange information with a server . Each socket opened by each kiosk function is able to thus connect to a separate entity or device connected to the network. The Windows operating environment and other operating systems that can be used such as Linux or XWindows allow for application windows including instances of browsers to be tiled or over overlapped. Thus in one embodiment each kiosk operation comprises either a browser or non browser application window executing a local secure network or web application executing simultaneously.

In another embodiment each browser instance is located in a dedicated or non dedicated screen region on screen as described in application Ser. No. 11 140 239 entitled User Interface System And Method For A Gaming Machine filed on May 26 2005 the 239 Application . That application describes an embedded user interface with separate screen regions wherein each screen region is implemented as a separate execution of a browser program or instance of a browser program. In this embodiment the screen is divided into screen regions as described in the 239 Application with the content of each screen region being controlled by one or more kiosk servers as described above with each browser window .

In one embodiment the kiosk device is capable of being attached to any other device or physical mounting area such as a bar top wall desk e.g. in a hotel room vending machine and the like. In another embodiment the kiosk device is mounted to a traditional stand alone kiosk cabinet to replace or enhance the functionality of the stand alone kiosk. For example and not by way of limitation a kiosk that is normally used for hotel reservations or other functions can be enhanced by attaching the kiosk device as an embedded additional user interface for the stand alone kiosk to add the ability to purchase airline tickets and the like. Still another embodiment for the bar top mounting can be used for example and not by way of limitation for ordering drink re fills or food from the kitchen while providing the ability to transfer funds into a casino account from a player s bank account.
