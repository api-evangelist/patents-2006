This application is a continuation of Ser. No. 10 717 864 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 098 438 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RESETTING A HIGH SPEED LATCH CIRCUIT filed Nov. 19 2003.

This invention was made with Government support under Contract No. N00014 98 3 0013. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

This invention relates in general to high speed latch circuits and more particularly to techniques for resetting a high speed latch circuit.

High speed latches can be used to build sophisticated digital processing systems such as those used to process microwave signals. These latches store digital data under the action of a clock signal. Where the clock signal has a high frequency for example above 1 GHz and up to 500 GHz or more one known type of latch has two resonant tunneling diodes RTDs which are coupled in series and which operate at GHz clock rates with very low power consumption.

In these known latch circuits the series coupled RTDs receive electrical power from a current limited voltage source which may for example be a battery and two resistors. The data input signal may be supplied to the latch through a resistor coupled to the node between the RTDs. A reset circuit is normally coupled across the series connected RTDs. For example where the two RTDs are coupled in series between first and second nodes one known reset circuit has a simple field effect transistor FET with its source and drain respectively coupled to the first and second nodes and has a clock signal which is applied to the gate of the FET. The voltage of the clock signal varies in a periodic manner over time so that the electrical resistance of the drain to source path through the FET alternates between a highly resistive state and a highly conducting state. When the FET is in its highly conducting state the potential difference between the drain and source terminals of the FET which is also the potential difference between the outer nodes of the series coupled RTDs drops to a value sufficient to force the voltage across both RTDs to a low or off state. When the latch is in this state it is said to be reset.

When the clock signal changes state and causes the FET to change to its highly resistive state the voltage across the series coupled RTDs rises until one or both of the RTDs switches to a high voltage or on state. The final electrical state of the RTDs is determined by the polarity of the electrical current which is being provided to the latch by the data input signal at the moment in time when the FET transitions from its highly conducting state to its highly resistive state. Thus this circuit configuration provides an edge sensitive clocked digital latch.

Although this configuration has been generally adequate for its intended purpose it has not been satisfactory in all respects. For example one disadvantage is that the dynamic gate current of the FET is effectively introduced into the operation of the latch circuit which is a phenomenon commonly known as clock injection . In more detail as the voltage of the clock signal varies over time a displacement current is produced at the gate of the FET and is proportional to the rate of change of the clock signal voltage. This current passes through the drain and source nodes of the FET and into the RTD circuitry and can upset the normal electrical balance of the latch which in turn prevents the latch from accurately capturing the value of the data input signal. This disadvantageous effect of clock injection increases with the frequency of the clock so that the known latch circuit is limited in its frequency of operation by the effect of clock injection.

From the foregoing it may be appreciated that a need has arisen for a method and apparatus for resetting a high speed latch circuit in a manner which avoids at least the known problem of clock injection. According to the present invention a method and apparatus are provided to address this need in a context where a latch circuit has first and second resonant tunneling diodes coupled in series with each other between first and second nodes and a reset portion coupled to the first and second nodes. The method and apparatus involve configuring the reset portion to include a photodiode portion which is responsive to varying photonic energy for switching between first and second states that are different and causing the photodiode portion to normalize a voltage across each of the resonant tunneling diodes when the reset portion is in its first state.

The latch circuit includes a latch portion and a recess portion . The latch portion includes two resonant tunneling diodes RTDS and of a known type which are coupled in series between two nodes and with a further node defined between the RTDs and . The latch portion has a bias terminal to which is applied a positive direct current DC bias voltage V. The latch portion has a further bias terminal to which is applied a negative DC bias voltage V. The bias voltages applied to the bias terminals and are opposite in polarity but equal in magnitude.

The latch portion includes a resistor which is coupled between the bias terminal and the node and a further resistor which is coupled between the bias terminal and the node . The resistors have equivalent resistance characteristics.

The latch circuit includes an input resistor which is coupled between the input terminal and the node . The node is coupled to the output terminal . The reset portion includes a photodiode of a known type such as a PIN photodiode or a metal semiconductor metal MSM photodiode. The photodiode has its cathode coupled to the node and its anode coupled to the node .

In the disclosed embodiment the light source is a periodic pulsed laser of a type known in the art such as a mode locked laser or a fiber ring laser. Alternatively the light source could be a continuous laser with a mechanical shutter or some other device that produces a periodic optical signal. The light source outputs a varying optical signal which serves as a clock signal that varies in a periodic manner.

The RTDs and are selected or configured to be substantially identical to each other so that they have substantially equivalent operational characteristics.

The operational characteristics of RTDs are known in the art but to facilitate an understanding of the present invention are discussed briefly here. In this regard since the RTDs and are effectively identical the following discussion focuses only on the RTD .

Although the curve in can be viewed as a representation of how current varies as a function of a variation in voltage it can conversely be viewed as a representation of how voltage varies as a function of a variation in current. In this regard it will be noted that as the current is progressively increased to a value of Ifrom a value of zero the voltage progressively increases to a value of Vfrom a value of zero as indicated diagrammatically at .

Then as soon as the current exceeds the value Ithe voltage suddenly makes a significant jump at from a value of Vat the top of the resonant peak to a value of Vat a point along the leading edge of the resonant peak . As is known in the art this significant change in voltage from Vto Voccurs extremely rapidly for example as fast as about 1.5 to 2.0 picoseconds. Thereafter as the current continues to progressively increase above the value I the voltage progressively increases above the value V as indicated diagrammatically at .

Assume that the current is thereafter progressively decreased. The voltage progressively decreases as indicated diagrammatically at . The decreasing current eventually reaches a value of I which corresponds to a voltage of V. As soon as the current is decreased below the value I then the voltage jumps very rapidly at from the voltage Vto the voltage V and then continues to progressively decrease as shown at . The change at from the voltage Vto the voltage Voccurs very rapidly for example within about 2.0 picoseconds or less.

As is known in the art the curve shown in represents the relationship between a positive current and a positive voltage for the RTD . For a negative current and voltage there is a similar curve for the RTD which is a mirror image of the curve shown in reflected about the origin point at the intersection of the two axes.

The latch circuit of operates in the following manner. As the optical signal is varied between two different intensities in a periodic manner the photodiode responds to the optical signal by changing between two different operational states. In one operational state the photodiode is conductive. In the other operational state the photodiode is substantially non conductive.

When the photodiode is conductive it essentially appears as a short between the nodes and thereby initializing the voltage across each of the RTDs and to a value of effectively zero volts. Then when the optical signal changes and causes the photodiode to switch from its conductive state to its non conductive state the latch portion will latch itself into one of two different equilibrium states depending on the value of the input voltage Vpresent at the input terminal when the photodiode switches to its non conductive state. The manner in which this occurs in explained in more detail below.

First assume that the photodiode is in its conductive state and that the input voltage Vat the terminal is a positive voltage representing a binary 1 . Since the nodes and are effectively shorted together by the conductive photodiode they will both be at substantially the same voltage. To the extent that a nominal current may possibly flow through the resistor from the input terminal it will split into two equal components that respectively flow through the RTDs and producing the same small voltage across each RTD from the node to the respective node or . The voltage across each of the RTDs and will be effectively zero.

When the photodiode changes from its conductive state to its non conductive state a current component will flow from the terminal through the resistor the RTDs and and the resistor to the terminal . This magnitude of this current component will be the same in each of the RTDs and . As this current progressively increases it will tend to cause the voltages across the RTDs and to progressively increase. If this was the only current flowing the voltages across the RTDs and would always be substantially identical at any given point in time. However a further current component is caused by the input voltage Vat the input terminal and must also be taken into account.

More specifically since it is being assumed that the input voltage at the terminal is a positive voltage a current component will be caused to flow from the terminal through the resistor the RTD and the resistor to the bias terminal . Thus in addition to the current component which is flowing through both of the RTDs and there is an additional current component which flows through the RTD but not the RTD . Therefore the total current flowing through the RTD will be greater than the total current flowing through the RTD . As a result and with reference to the RTD will reach the current Icorresponding to the top of its first resonant peak somewhat before the RTD can reach this same current and thus the top of its first resonant peak.

When the current flowing through the RTD reaches and exceeds the current Icorresponding to the top of its first resonant peak the voltage across the RTD suddenly and rapidly jumps from Vto Vas indicated at . Consequently the voltage across the RTD will suddenly be significantly larger than the voltage across the RTD which in turn will affect the ratio of voltages across the two RTDs and . As a result the characteristic curves and for the RTDs and will effectively shift with respect to each other until a point of equilibrium is reached.

In this regard is a graph similar to but showing how the curves and will have shifted when an equilibrium is reached where the equilibrium point along the two curves and is shown at and corresponds to a binary 1 . It will be noted that the equilibrium point is disposed along the first resonant peak of the curve for the RTD and is disposed along the second resonant peak of the curve for the RTD . The RTDs and become latched in this equilibrium state. The equilibrium point represents the voltage at the node between the two RTDs and . As evident from this is a positive voltage because the voltage across the RTD is larger than the voltage across the RTD . Since the node is coupled directly to the output terminal the output terminal of the latch circuit will be at a positive voltage which represents a binary 1 .

Turning now to the converse situation assume that the input voltage Vat the input terminal is negative when the photodiode changes from its conductive state to its non conductive state. In this situation a first current component will flow from the bias terminal through the resistor the RTDs and and the resistor to the bias terminal . Since the input voltage Vat the input terminal is negative a further current component will flow from the bias terminal through the resistor the RTD and the resistor to the input terminal . Consequently the total current flowing through the RTD will be greater than the total current flowing through the RTD . Therefore with reference to the voltage across the RTD will reach the top of its first resonant peak before the voltage across the RTD can reach the top of its first resonant peak thereby causing the RTD to experience a rapid and significant increase in voltage as indicated at in .

The voltages and currents of the RTDs and will then adjust accordingly until they reach an equilibrium state which is the point shown at in . The RTDs and will be effectively latched in this state where the node and thus the output terminal are each at a voltage less than zero representing a binary 0 .

After the RTDs and have become latched at either one of the two equilibrium points shown at and in the latch circuit will be reset when the optical signal from the light source changes in a manner that causes the photodiode to switch from its non conductive state to its conductive state. In particular when the photodiode becomes conductive it appears as a short between the nodes and and effectively resets the latch portion by returning the voltage across each of the RTDs and to an effective value of zero.

In the apparatus includes a latch circuit which is identical to the latch circuit shown in except that it includes a reset portion which is different from the reset portion of . More specifically the reset portion in has a capacitor which is coupled between the node and the cathode of the photodiode and has a further capacitor which is coupled between the node and the anode of the photodiode . The capacitors and are effectively identical.

The latch portion includes a terminal to which is applied a positive DC voltage V and a further terminal to which is applied a negative DC voltage V. The voltage V could optionally be the same as the voltage V and the voltage V could optionally be the same as the voltage V. A resistor is coupled between the terminal and the cathode of the photodiode and a further resistor is coupled between the terminal and the anode of the photodiode . The resistors and are effectively identical.

The operation of the latch circuit of is generally similar to the operation of the latch circuit of and is therefore not described here in detail. It is sufficient to point out that when the photodiode changes state in response to the optical signal pulses are produced through the capacitors and and serve to normalize or reset the RTDs and so that the voltage across each is effectively zero.

The apparatus includes a latch circuit which is effectively identical to the latch circuit of except that the bias voltages Vand Vin the latch portion have been swapped and the latch circuit includes a reset portion which is different from the reset portion of . The reset portion includes the capacitor which has one end coupled to the node and its other end coupled to the anode of a photodiode . The cathode of the photodiode is coupled to the terminal . Similarly the capacitor has one end coupled to the node and its other end coupled to the cathode of a further photodiode . The anode of the photodiode is coupled to the terminal . The photodiodes and are known devices and are equivalent.

A resistor has one end coupled to the anode of the photodiode and its other end coupled to a node which in turn is coupled to ground. A resistor has one end coupled to the cathode of the photodiode and its other end coupled to the node . The resistors and are equivalent.

The latch circuit of operates in a manner which is generally similar to the latch circuit of . The operation of the latch circuit is therefore not described here in full detail. It is sufficient to mention that in response to the optical signal from the light source the photodiodes and each change state in a manner producing pulses through the capacitors and which serve to reset the RTDs and so that voltage across each is effectively zero. More specifically a positive going voltage that appears across resistor produces a positive displacement current in capacitor which cancels the steady negative current in resistor . Similarly a negative going voltage that appears across resistor produces a negative displacement current in capacitor which cancels the steady positive current in resistor . The cancellation currents effectively reset each of the RTDs and to a low voltage state.

As evident from the foregoing discussion the latch circuit the latch circuit and the latch circuit have pairs of components that are effectively equivalent. For example the resistors and are effectively equivalent the resistors and are effectively equivalent the capacitors and are effectively equivalent the resistors and are effectively equivalent the photodiodes and are effectively equivalent the resistors and are effectively equivalent and the RTDs and are effectively equivalent. Further there are pairs of equal and opposite voltages such as Vand V and V and V. However it will be recognized that through suitable design the components of each pair and or the voltages of each pair could be configured so that they are not equivalent. Also it will be recognized that although the drawings show certain selected circuit configurations there are a variety of other possible circuit configurations which also embody the subject matter of the present invention.

The present invention provides a number of advantages. One such advantage is that since the disclosed latch circuits each have a reset portion which is responsive to an optical control signal the control signal does not inject any current into the latch circuit thus preventing the latch circuit from being adversely influenced by an extraneous current derived from the control signal. This avoids the phenomenon commonly known as clock injection .

A further advantage is that this is achieved in a latch circuit which is based on a pair of resonant tunneling diodes that inherently switch very fast and that have a low power dissipation. The result is a latch which is extremely fast and can operate at clock speeds up to or greater than 500 GHz. Applications for such a latch include extremely fast analog to digital converters digital to analog converters true time delays microwave memory first in first out memories queuing systems serial to parallel shift registers and clocked logic as well as a variety of other devices.

Although selected embodiments have been illustrated and described in detail it will be understood that various substitutions and alterations are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.
