The present invention relates generally to aqueous dispersions and dispersion compounds that optionally include a filler. More specifically the present invention relates to dispersions that are useful in the shoe industry.

This application is a 371 National Stage Application of International Application No. PCT US2006 046494 filed on Dec. 4 2006 entitled AQUEOUS POLYOLEFIN DISPERSIONS FOR TEXTILE IMPREGNATION claiming priority from the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 300 993 which is granted as U.S. Pat. No. 7 528 080 filed on Dec. 15 2005 entitled AQUEOUS POLYOLEFIN DISPERSIONS FOR TEXTILE IMPREGNATION the teachings of which are incorporated by reference herein as if reproduced in full hereinbelow.

Many shoes incorporate stiffeners such as toe boxes a.k.a. toe cap toe puff and counters to retain the shape of the shoe throughout the active life of the shoe. A counter is a piece of heavy leather or other stiffening material inserted between the outside and the lining of the upper at the back part of the shoe. The purpose of the counter is to strengthen the back part of the shoe and to prevent it from sagging and losing its shape. A toe box is a stiffener used to maintain the shape of a shoe toe preserve toe room within the shoe and give reasonable protection to the wearer s foot.

Processes used for the manufacture of base sheets for stiffener production include filmic processes impregnation processes and sintering. The preferred process to employ often depends upon the desired stiffness of the finished product. For example there are three types of toe boxes rigid flexible and soft. Rigid toes include safety shoes. Flexible toes may be flexed by thumb pressure yet have semi rigid walls. Soft toes include those which are intended to merely preserve the toe form and give maximum comfort to the wearer. A filmic process may be preferred for a rigid safety shoe as materials prepared by a filmic process are often more resilient compared to impregnated materials.

In a filmic process a thermoplastic sheet can be extruded and laminated to a low weight textile typically 20 g m followed by hot melt coating of a polyurethane or polyamide adhesive. The function of the fabric is to provide a compatible layer between the extruded sheet and the adhesive layer. For example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 814 037 a shoe stiffener is formed from multilayer coextruded plastics.

In a sintering process a thermoplastic powder such as a polycaprolactone or a PVC polycaprolactone e.g. TONE a linear polycaprolactone polyester available from The Dow Chemical Company is applied onto a textile and sintered in an oven. For example German Patent No. 2 621 195 discloses stiffening materials which are produced by melting powdered mixtures of plastics and fillers onto textile fabrics. Adhesives are then used to bind the stiffener to other parts of a shoe. In U.S. Pat. No. 4 717 496 the polyester used in the stiffening composition has both binding and adhesive properties.

In an impregnation process a textile is impregnated with an emulsion or with a polymer solution. Impregnation systems can be water based or solvent based and include SBR natural and polychloroprene latexes and styrenic polymers. The compatibility of the stiffener fabric and any adhesives used during shoe construction can affect the resiliency lasting stiffness and shape retention of the stiffener and the shoe. For example in GB 935 001 a heat activable shoe stiffener blank formed as a fibrous base is loaded or impregnated with PS PVC PVA or an SB copolymer resin that stiffens after exposure to a solvent or to a temperature of 100 C. yet remains softenable such that the material can be reshaped as needed. U.S. Pat. No. 4 507 357 further adds to the stiffening composition a plasticizer and an aminoplast. In both of these patents low temperature processability was desired so as to protect other shoe parts from damage during manufacture. U.S. Pat. No. 6 391 380 discloses a stiffener composition which includes a latex forming resin and a powder adhesive polyester resin. To avoid softening during storage or exposure to moderate temperatures U.S. Pat. No. 3 961 124 employs a stiffening composition having a crosslinkable resin and a peroxide initiator thermosetting the stiffener during shoe manufacture.

Combinations of the above processes can also be used. For example In U.S. Pat. No. 3 708 332 fabrics were impregnated with mixtures containing polystyrene and styrene butadiene copolymers and coated with polycaprolactone to form shoe stiffener sheets.

Other patents related to stiffening compositions and shoe stiffeners include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 284 872 3 778 251 and 3 961 124 British Patents GB 2 102 851 2 091 768 2 024 279 1 065 418 1 062 498 and 1 036 790 and WO2003 000810 among others.

Impregnated systems incorporating SBR SB polychloroprene or a blend of polychloroprene and natural latex are common as noted above. Each of these systems has drawbacks such as poor resiliency elasticity cost curing requirements and allergic properties as well as potentially poor compatibility with other components in the shoe structure. In view of these drawbacks there exists a need for suitable replacements for or alternatives to conventional latex stiffening compositions.

In one aspect the present invention relates to a stiffening composition including a thermoplastic polyolefin that is formed as an aqueous dispersion suitable for impregnating a fibrous structure. In another aspect a fibrous structure impregnated with such a stiffening composition can provide adequate stiffness elasticity resilience adhesion and shape retention for use in shoe stiffeners such as toe boxes counters and the like. Use of a thermoplastic polyolefin stiffening composition is advantageous because it can further provide improved compatibility with other components in the shoe structure.

The present invention provides an article formed by impregnating a fibrous structure with a compound the compound including an aqueous dispersion and thereafter removing at least a portion of the water from the impregnated fibrous structure. The aqueous dispersion can include a at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of an ethylene based thermoplastic polymer a propylene based thermoplastic polymer and mixtures thereof b at least one polymeric stabilizing agent and c water.

The present invention also provides a method of forming a stiffened textile product comprising the steps of forming a compound the compound including an aqueous dispersion containing at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of ethylene based thermoplastic polymers propylene based thermoplastic polymers and mixtures thereof and thereafter impregnating a suitable textile with the compound and allowing the impregnated textile to stiffen by removing at least a portion of the water from the impregnated textile structure. The method may include the steps of forming a compound the compound including an aqueous dispersion having a at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of an ethylene based thermoplastic polymer a propylene based polymer and mixtures thereof b at least one polymeric stabilizing agent and c water impregnating the textile with the compound and allowing the impregnated textile to stiffen.

Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the above list is a non comprehensive listing of suitable polymers. It will be appreciated that the scope of the present invention is restricted by the claims only.

Embodiments of the present invention use a stabilizing agent to promote the formation of a stable dispersion or emulsion. In selected embodiments the stabilizing agent may be a surfactant a polymer different from the base polymer detailed above or mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments the stabilizing agent is a polar polymer having a polar group as either a co monomer or grafted monomer. In preferred embodiments the stabilizing agent comprises one or more polar polyolefins having a polar group as either a co monomer or grafted monomer. Typical polymers include ethylene acrylic acid EAA and ethylene methacrylic acid copolymers such as those available under the tradenames PRIMACOR NUCREL and ESCOR and described in U.S. Pat.

Other polymers include ethylene ethyl acrylate EEA copolymer ethylene methyl methacrylate EMMA and ethylene butyl acrylate EBA . Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a number of other useful polymers may also be used.

If the polar group of the polymer is acidic or basic in nature the stabilizing polymer may be partially or fully neutralized with a neutralizing agent to form the corresponding salt. For example for EAA the neutralizing agent is a base such as ammonium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. In another alternative the neutralizing agent may for example be any amine such as monoethanolamine or 2 amino 2 methyl 1 propanol AMP . Those having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the selection of an appropriate neutralizing agent depends on the specific composition formulated and that such a choice is within the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art.

Additional surfactants that may be useful in the practice of the present invention include cationic surfactants anionic surfactants or a non ionic surfactants. Examples of anionic surfactants include sulfonates carboxylates and phosphates. Examples of cationic surfactants include quaternary amines. Examples of non ionic surfactants include block copolymers containing ethylene oxide and silicone surfactants.

External surfactants are surfactants that do not become chemically reacted into the polymer during dispersion preparation. Examples of external surfactants useful herein include salts of dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid and lauryl sulfonic acid salt. Internal surfactants are surfactants that do become chemically reacted into the polymer during dispersion preparation. An example of an internal surfactant useful herein includes 2 2 dimethylol propionic acid and its salts.

Embodiments of the present invention employ a filler as part of the composition. In the practice of the present invention a suitable filler loading in a polyolefin dispersion can be from about 0 to about 600 parts of filler per hundred parts of polyolefin. In certain embodiments the filler loading in the dispersion can be from about 0 to about 200 parts of filler per hundred parts of a combined amount of the polyolefin and the polymeric stabilizing agent. The filler material can include conventional fillers such as milled glass calcium carbonate aluminum trihydrate talc antimony trioxide fly ash clays such as bentonite or kaolin clays for example or other known fillers.

In preferred formulations therefore dispersions in accordance with the present invention may include a base polymer which comprises at least one non polar polyolefin a stabilizing agent which comprises at least one polar polyolefin and optionally a filler. With respect to the base polymer and the stabilizing agent in preferred embodiments the at least one non polar polyolefin may comprise between about 30 to 99 by weight of the total amount of base polymer and stabilizing agent in the composition. More preferably the at least one non polar polyolefin comprises between about 50 and about 80 . Still more preferably the one or more non polar polyolefins comprise about 70 .

With respect to the filler typically an amount greater than about 0 to about 1000 parts per hundred of the polymer polymer meaning here the non polar polyolefin combined with the stabilizing agent is used. In selected embodiments between about 50 to 250 parts per hundred are used. In selected embodiments between about 10 to 500 parts per hundred are used. In still other embodiments from between about 20 to 400 parts per hundred are used. In other embodiments from about 0 to about 200 parts per hundred are used.

These solid materials are preferably dispersed in a liquid medium which in preferred embodiments is water. In preferred embodiments sufficient base is added to neutralize the resultant dispersion to achieve a pH range of between about 6 to about 14. In preferred embodiments sufficient base is added to maintain a pH of between about 9 to about 12. Water content of the dispersion is preferably controlled so that the solids content is between about 1 to about 74 by volume . In another embodiment the solid content is between about 25 to about 74 by volume . In particularly preferred embodiments the solids range is between about 30 to about 50 without filler by weight .

In certain embodiments a fibrous structure or textile impregnated with a compound can have a combined amount of the at least one polymer and the polymeric stabilizing agent in the range of about 10 to about 150 parts per hundred parts by weight of the textile. In other embodiments a fibrous structure or textile impregnated with a compound can have a combined amount of the filler the at least one polymer and the polymeric stabilizing agent in the range of about 10 to about 600 parts per hundred parts by weight of the textile from about 10 to about 300 parts in other embodiments.

Dispersions formed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention are characterized in having an average particle size of between about 0.3 to about 3.0 microns. In other embodiments dispersions have an average particle size of from about 0.5 m to about 2.7 m. In other embodiments from about 0.8 m to about 1.2 m. By average particle size the present invention means the volume mean particle size. In order to measure the particle size laser diffraction techniques may be employed for example. A particle size in this description refers to the diameter of the polymer in the dispersion. For polymer particles that are not spherical the diameter of the particle is the average of the long and short axes of the particle. Particle sizes can be measured on a Beckman Coulter LS230 laser diffraction particle size analyzer or other suitable device.

For example a formulation of the present invention can include surfactants frothing agents dispersants thickeners fire retardants pigments antistatic agents reinforcing fibers antioxidants a neutralizing agent a rheology modifier preservatives biocides acid scavengers a wetting agent and the like. While optional for purposes of the present invention other components can be highly advantageous for product stability during and after the manufacturing process.

In addition embodiments of the present invention optionally include a filler wetting agent. A filler wetting agent generally may help make the filler and the polyolefin dispersion more compatible. Useful wetting agents include phosphate salts such as sodium hexametaphosphate. A filler wetting agent can be included in a composition of the present invention at a concentration of at least about 0.5 part per 100 parts of filler by weight.

Furthermore embodiments of the present invention may optionally include a thickener. Thickeners can be useful in the present invention to increase the viscosity of low viscosity dispersions. Thickeners suitable for use in the practice of the present invention can be any known in the art such as for instance poly acrylate type or associate non ionic thickeners such as modified cellulose ethers. For example suitable thickeners include ALCOGUM VEP II trade name of Alco Chemical Corporation RHEOVIS and VISCALEX trade names of Ciba Ceigy UCAR Thickener 146 or ETHOCEL or METHOCEL trade names of the Dow Chemical Company and PARAGUM 241 trade name of Para Chem Southern Inc. or BERMACOL trademark of Akzo Nobel or AQUALON trademark of Hercules or ACUSOL trademark of Rohm and Haas . Thickeners can be used in any amount necessary to prepare a dispersion of desired viscosity.

The ultimate viscosity of the dispersion is therefore controllable. Addition of the thickener to the dispersion including the amount of filler can be done with conventional means to result in viscosities as needed. Viscosities of thus dispersions can reach 3000 cP Brookfield spindle 4 with 20 rpm with moderate thickener dosing up to 4 preferably below 3 based on 100 phr of polymer dispersion . The starting polymer dispersion as described has an initial viscosity prior to formulation with fillers and additives between 20 and 1000 cP Brookfield viscosity measured at room temperature with spindle RV3 at 50 rpm . Still more preferably the starting viscosity of the dispersion may be between about 100 to about 600 cP.

Also embodiments of the present invention are characterized by their stability when a filler is added to the polymer stabilizing agent. In this context stability refers to the stability of viscosity of the resultant aqueous polyolefin dispersion. In order to test the stability the viscosity is measured over a period of time. Preferably viscosity measured at 20 C. should remain 10 of the original viscosity over a period of 24 hours when stored at ambient temperature.

In a specific embodiment a base polymer a stabilizing agent and a filler are melt kneaded in an extruder along with water and a neutralizing agent such as ammonia potassium hydroxide or a combination of the two to form a dispersion compound. Those having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a number of other neutralizing agents may be used. In some embodiments the filler may be added after blending the base polymer and stabilizing agent. In other preferred embodiments the filler may be added after the dispersion is formed.

Any melt kneading means known in the art may be used. In some embodiments a kneader a BANBURY mixer single screw extruder or a multi screw extruder is used. A process for producing the dispersions in accordance with the present invention is not particularly limited. One preferred process for example is a process comprising melt kneading the above mentioned components according to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 756 659 and 6 455 636.

Resin in the form of pellets powder or flakes is fed from the feeder to an inlet of the extruder where the resin is melted or compounded. In some embodiments the dispersing agent is added to the resin through and along with the resin and in other embodiments the dispersing agent is provided separately to the twin screw extruder . The resin melt is then delivered from the mix and convey zone to an emulsification zone of the extruder where the initial amount of water and base from the reservoirs and is added through inlet . In some embodiments dispersing agent may be added additionally or exclusively to the water stream. In some embodiments the emulsified mixture is further diluted with additional water inlet from reservoir in a dilution and cooling zone of the extruder . Typically the dispersion is diluted to at least 30 weight percent water in the cooling zone. In addition the diluted mixture may be diluted any number of times until the desired dilution level is achieved. In some embodiments water is not added into the twin screw extruder but rather to a stream containing the resin melt after the melt has exited from the extruder. In this manner steam pressure build up in the extruder is eliminated.

Advantageously by using an extruder in certain embodiments the base polymer and the stabilizing agent may be blended in a single process to form a dispersion. Also advantageously by using one or more of the stabilizing agents listed above the dispersion is stable with respect to the filler and other additives. Prior formulations involving polyolefin base polymers were unstable with respect to the filler.

Advantageously polyolefin dispersions formed in accordance with the embodiments disclosed herein provide the ability to apply the dispersion to or to impregnate the dispersion into films sheets fabrics or fibers and achieve good adhesive properties and to maintain a flexible laminate. In specific embodiments the inventors have also discovered that dispersions disclosed herein have good adhesion to polar substrates.

In some embodiments a polyolefin dispersion or dispersion compound may be applied to a fibrous structure using any application method known to those skilled in the art. In other embodiments a fibrous structure may be impregnated with a polyolefin dispersion or dispersion compound. In certain embodiments fibrous structures can include textiles geotextiles and natural fibers. In certain embodiments the fibrous structure may be cotton wool synthetic wool cellulosics including rayon synthetic fibers of polyamide polyacrylonitrile polyvinyl chloride polyvinylidene chloride polypropylenes polyesters or combinations thereof. In other embodiments the fibrous structure may be flax hemp cellulose pulp wood or combinations thereof.

When preparing foams it is often preferred to froth the dispersion. Preferred in the practice of this invention is the use of a gas as a frothing agent. Examples of suitable frothing agents include gases and or mixtures of gases such as air carbon dioxide nitrogen argon helium and the like. Particularly preferable is the use of air as a frothing agent. Frothing agents are typically introduced by mechanical introduction of a gas into a liquid to form a froth. This technique is known as mechanical frothing. In preparing a frothed polyolefin backing it is preferred to mix all components and then blend the air or gas into the mixture using equipment such as an OAKES MONDO or FIRESTONE frother.

Surfactants useful for preparing a stable froth are referred to herein as foam stabilizers. Foam stabilizers are useful in the practice of the present invention. Those having ordinary skill in this field will recognize that a number of foam stabilizers may be used. Foam stabilizers can include for example sulfates succinamates and sulfosuccinamates.

In one embodiment of the present invention shown in flowchart form in a polyolefin dispersion is formed ST . Next the dispersion is frothed ST which may for example be done by mechanically mixing with air. A fabric fiber sheet or film is then contacted with the froth ST . For example the froth can be coated or spread onto a fabric or a fabric can be immersed in the froth. In selected embodiments the polyolefin dispersion is applied at about 65 C. to about 125 C. In other embodiments the polyolefin dispersion is applied at about 70 C. to about 120 C. In preferred embodiments the polyolefin dispersion is applied at about 85 C. to about 95 C.

The dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be dried via any conventional drying method. Such conventional drying methods include but are not limited to air drying convection oven drying hot air drying microwave oven drying and or infrared oven drying. The dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be dried at any temperature for example it may be dried at a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer or in the alternative it may be dried at a temperature in the range of less than the melting point of the base polymer. The dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be dried at a temperature in the range of about 60 F. 15.5 C. to about 700 F. 371 C. All individual values and subranges from about 60 F. 15.5 C. to about 700 F. 371 C. are included herein and disclosed herein for example the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be dried at a temperature in the range of about 60 F. 15.5 C. to about 500 F. 260 C. or in the alternative the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be dried at a temperature in the range of about 60 F. 15.5 C. to about 450 F. 232.2 C. . The temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be raised to a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than about 40 minutes. All individual values and subranges from less than about 40 minutes are included herein and disclosed herein for example the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be raised to a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than about 20 minutes or in the alternative the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be raised to a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than about 10 minutes or in another alternative the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be raised to a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period in the range of about 0.5 to 600 seconds. In another alternative the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be raised to a temperature in the range of less than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than 40 minutes. All individual values and subranges from less than about 40 minutes are included herein and disclosed herein for example the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be raised to a temperature in the range of less than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than about 20 minutes or in the alternative the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be raised to a temperature in the range of less than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period of less than about 10 minutes or in another alternative the temperature of the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove may be raised to a temperature in the range of less than the melting point temperature of the base polymer for a period in the range of about 0.5 to 600 seconds.

Drying the dispersion impregnated into a substrate for example the fibrous structure as described hereinabove at a temperature in the range of equal or greater than the melting point temperature of the base polymer is important because it facilitates the formation of a film having a continuous base polymer phase with a discrete stabilizing agent phase dispersed therein the continuous base polymer phase thereby improving the oil and grease resistance as well as providing a barrier for moisture and vapor transmission.

The amount or degree to which a fibrous structure is impregnated with the compound or dispersion compound can be controlled. For example impregnation can be controlled by pressing the fabric between calenders removing excess material. Impregnation can additionally be controlled for example by adjusting one or more of the viscosity of the compound the concentration of the combined polymer and stabilizer in the aqueous dispersion the concentration of the filler in the compound or the polarity of the aqueous dispersion.

In certain embodiments the impregnated textile can have a combined amount of the at least one polymer and the polymeric stabilizing agent in the range of about 15 to about 75 parts per hundred by weight of the impregnated textile. To maintain the desired degree of impregnation for example in certain embodiments the polyolefin can be controlled in the range from about 35 to about 55 percent by weight of the aqueous dispersion. In other embodiments the polyolefin can be controlled in the range from about 40 to about 50 percent by volume of the aqueous dispersion. In other embodiments the viscosity of the compound can be controlled in the range from about 20 to about 3000 cP.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that a desirable degree or amount of impregnation can range from a partial saturation of the fibrous structure to a complete saturation of the fibrous structure. The desired degree of impregnation can depend upon variables including the nature of the fiber being impregnated and the nature of impregnate for example. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the intended end properties of the impregnated structure will influence the selection of the specific ingredients fibers and dispersions for example and processing parameters.

In a particular embodiment a fibrous structure impregnated with a polyolefin dispersion can be used as a stiffener in shoes. For example a fibrous structure can be impregnated formed and dried where the forming results in an upper assembly stiffener such as a counter or a toe puff toe box which can be incorporated into a shoe to assist in retaining the respective portions of the shoe in a desired configuration.

Polymer dispersions. Two polyolefin dispersions were used throughout these examples and comprised a base polymer stabilizing agent mix. The first was formed using a VERSIFY DP4200 PRIMACOR 5980I mixture and the second using an ENGAGE 8200 PRIMACOR 5980I mixture each of which is available from The Dow Chemical Company Midland Mich. . PRIMACOR 5980I is an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer 20.5 weight percent acrylic acid MFR of 13.8 using a 2.16 kg weight at 125 C. 0.958 g cc VERSIFY DP4200 is a propylene based elastomer 9 mole percent ethylene 25 MFR using a 2.16 kg weight at 230 C. ENGAGE 8200 is an ethylene based elastomer ethylene octene copolymer 5 MI 0.870 g cc .

The VERSIFY DP4200 PRIMACOR 5980I dispersion was produced by simultaneously feeding DP4200 pellets at 13.9 lb hr and 5980I pellets at 2.9 lb hr into an extruder feed funnel. Deionized water and a 25 w w aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide were pumped at 19 and 8.3 cc min respectively combined heated to about 160 C. and injected into the extruder barrel at the emulsification zone where the barrels were operated at about 150 C. Deionized water was pumped at 90 cc min heated to about 110 C. and injected into the extruder barrel at the dilution section where the barrels were operated at about 80 C. Product dilution was controlled at a pressure of about 300 psig. The resulting VERSIFY DP4200 PRIMACOR 5980I dispersion had a solids content of 51.6 weight percent a pH of about 10.0 a volume mean particle size of about 1.0 micron as measured by a Beckman Coulter LS 230 and a polydispersity defined as the volume mean particle size divided by the number mean particle size of less than 2.

The ENGAGE 8200 PRIMACOR 5980I dispersion was produced by first pre blending 8200 pellets with 5980I pellets at a 70 30 ratio. The blend was fed as ambient pellets into the extruder feed funnel at 15 lb hr. Deionized water and a 25 w w aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide were pumped at 14.6 and 15.3 cc min respectively combined heated to about 130 C. and injected into the extruder barrel at the emulsification zone where the barrels were operated at about 130 C. Deionized water was pumped at 85 cc min heated to about 75 C. and injected into the extruder barrel at the dilution section where the barrels were operated at about 70 C. The diluted product passed through a back pressure regulator set at about 300 PSIG exited the process at about 70 C. and was collected. The resulting ENGAGE 8200 PRIMACOR 5980I dispersion had a solids content of 44.9 weight percent a pH of 10.2 a volume mean particle size of about 1 micron as measured by a Beckman Coulter LS 230 and a polydispersity of less than 2.

Woven textile sheets. Two cotton polyester fabrics were supplied by Forestali Srl. for fabric impregnation experiments. Fabric A had a weight per square meter of 321.77 g mand Fabric B had a weight of 228.85 g m.

Dispersion formulations. The polymer dispersion described above were used to form two dispersion compounds including a calcium carbonate filler Hydrocarb 90 GD slurry 62.5 weight percent solids available from Omya . The dispersion formulations evaluated are described in Table 1 below.

Polymer dispersions and the filler slurry were weighed and mixed in a standard paper latex Heidolph Bench Stirrer at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. The viscosity was measured in a Brookfield viscometer spindle R3 100 RPM pH was measured with a Knick Portamess pH meter. Solids were measured with a CEM Smart System 5.

Fabric Impregnation. Sheets were impregnated in a laboratory impregnation unit Mathis Lab Padder manufactured by Werner Mathis AG Textile machinery Laboratory equipment Zurich . The impregnation process was performed in two steps. First the fabric sheets were soaked in a dispersion as described in Table 1 above for 2 minutes at room temperature. The sheets were then pressed between calender rolls at room temperature to remove excess liquids. The desired weight per square meter was controlled by adjusting the pressure between rolls. The impregnated sheets were then dried in convection oven 130 C. for 7 minutes. Four samples were impregnated in this manner and are described in Table 2.

Sample Test Results. The processability and performance of the stiffeners was tested. Processability is related to VICAT and open time. Performance properties are measured according to SATRA TM83 and include hardness area shape retention and resiliency. For measuring these properties a dome was thermoformed at 90 C. in a devise as illustrated in and .

Referring to a test specimen was clamped in the forming tool comprising a clamping ring a metal cylinder and a piston . The test specimen was then heat activated by heating the assembly in an oven at 95 C. for 8.5 minutes. The heat activated assembly was removed from the oven and the test specimen was promptly formed into a dome shape within about a minute by extending piston as illustrated by . The formed test specimen was then left in a standard controlled environment of 20 C. and 65 relative humidity in front of a fan for at least 1.5 hours.

Hardness commonly referred to as compression strength of a formed dome provides a measure of the strength of the stiffener in a way that corresponds to wear performance conditions. The top of the formed dome was compressed at a constant rate in a tensile testing machine using a cylindrical plunger with a level lower surface until it collapses. The maximum value was recorded as the initial hardness. This operation was repeated and after nine additional collapses the load for the tenth collapse was measured and recorded as final hardness. Compression strength of a domed test specimen was measured according to SATRA TM83. Hardness can range from 10 N for a fashion shoe to 180 N for military footwear.

Area shape retention was measured according to SATRA TM83. A domed specimen was formed and the shape retention of the test specimen was determined by measuring the height of the dome. Two measurements were taken after the first initial compression of the dome and a after ten collapses final shape retention . Area shape retention is defined as 100 12 where H is the height of the relevant forming tool the dome of the metal mold and H is the internal height of formed dome after first or tenth collapse as illustrated in . The harder the stiffener the higher the shape retention to avoid the deformation of the shoe.

Resiliency is calculated according to SATRA TM83 and is defined as the ratio of final hardness after 10 load collapses to initial hardness. Resiliency provides a measure of the resistance to small and large deformations during wear.

Branching distributions are determined by crystallization analysis fractionation CRYSTAF using a CRYSTAF 200 unit commercially available from PolymerChar Valencia Spain. The samples are dissolved in 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene at 160 C. 0.66 mg mL for 1 hr and stabilized at 95 C. for 45 minutes. The sampling temperatures range from 95 to 30 C. at a cooling rate of 0.2 C. min. An infrared detector is used to measure the polymer solution concentrations. The cumulative soluble concentration is measured as the polymer crystallizes while the temperature is decreased. The analytical derivative of the cumulative profile reflects the short chain branching distribution of the polymer.

The CRYSTAF peak temperature and area are identified by the peak analysis module included in the CRYSTAF Software Version 2001.b PolymerChar Valencia Spain . The CRYSTAF peak finding routine identifies a peak temperature as a maximum in the dW dT curve and the area between the largest positive inflections on either side of the identified peak in the derivative curve. To calculate the CRYSTAF curve the preferred processing parameters are with a temperature limit of 70 C. and with smoothing parameters above the temperature limit of 0.1 and below the temperature limit of 0.3.

Samples are compression molded using ASTM D 1928. Flexural and 2 percent secant moduli are measured according to ASTM D 790. Storage modulus is measured according to ASTM D 5026 01 or equivalent technique.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry results are determined using a TAI model Q1000 DSC equipped with an RCS cooling accessory and an autosampler. A nitrogen purge gas flow of 50 ml min is used. The sample is pressed into a thin film and melted in the press at about 175 C. and then air cooled to room temperature 25 C. . 3 10 mg of material is then cut into a 6 mm diameter disk accurately weighed placed in a light aluminum pan ca 50 mg and then crimped shut. The thermal behavior of the sample is investigated with the following temperature profile. The sample is rapidly heated to 180 C. and held isothermal for 3 minutes in order to remove any previous thermal history. The sample is then cooled to 40 C. at 10 C. min cooling rate and held at 40 C. for 3 minutes. The sample is then heated to 150 C. at 10 C. min. heating rate. The cooling and second heating curves are recorded.

The DSC melting peak is measured as the maximum in heat flow rate W g with respect to the linear baseline drawn between 30 C. and end of melting. The heat of fusion is measured as the area under the melting curve between 30 C. and the end of melting using a linear baseline.

Calibration of the DSC is done as follows. First a baseline is obtained by running a DSC from 90 C. without any sample in the aluminum DSC pan. Then 7 milligrams of a fresh indium sample is analyzed by heating the sample to 180 C. cooling the sample to 140 C. at a cooling rate of 10 C. min followed by keeping the sample isothermally at 140 C. for 1 minute followed by heating the sample from 140 C. to 180 C. at a heating rate of 10 C. per minute. The heat of fusion and the onset of melting of the indium sample are determined and checked to be within 0.5 C. from 156.6 C. for the onset of melting and within 0.5 J g from 28.71 J g for the of fusion. Then deionized water is analyzed by cooling a small drop of fresh sample in the DSC pan from 25 C. to 30 C. at a cooling rate of 10 C. per minute. The sample is kept isothermally at 30 C. for 2 minutes and heat to 30 C. at a heating rate of 10 C. per minute. The onset of melting is determined and checked to be within 0.5 C. from 0 C.

The ethylene olefin interpolymers are characterized by an average block index ABI which is greater than zero and up to about 1.0 and a molecular weight distribution M Mgreater than about 1.3. The average block index ABI is the weight average of the block index BI for each of the polymer fractions obtained in preparative TREF i.e. fractionation of a polymer by Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation from 20 C. and 110 C. with an increment of 5 C. although other temperature increments such as 1 C. 2 C. 10 C. also can be used 

where BIis the block index for the ith fraction of the inventive ethylene olefin interpolymer obtained in preparative TREF and wis the weight percentage of the ith fraction. Similarly the square root of the second moment about the mean hereinafter referred to as the second moment weight average block index can be defined as follows.

where N is defined as the number of fractions with BIgreater than zero. Referring to for each polymer fraction BI is defined by one of the two following equations both of which give the same BI value 

where Tis the ATREF i.e. analytical TREF elution temperature for the ith fraction preferably expressed in Kelvin Pis the ethylene mole fraction for the ith fraction which can be measured by NMR or IR as described below. Pis the ethylene mole fraction of the whole ethylene olefin interpolymer before fractionation which also can be measured by NMR or IR. Tand Pare the ATREF elution temperature and the ethylene mole fraction for pure hard segments which refer to the crystalline segments of the interpolymer . As an approximation or for polymers where the hard segment composition is unknown the Tand Pvalues are set to those for high density polyethylene homopolymer.

Tis the ATREF elution temperature for a random copolymer of the same composition having an ethylene mole fraction of P and molecular weight as the inventive copolymer. Tcan be calculated from the mole fraction of ethylene measured by NMR using the following equation 

where and are two constants which can be determined by a calibration using a number of well characterized preparative TREF fractions of a broad composition random copolymer and or well characterized random ethylene copolymers with narrow composition. It should be noted that and may vary from instrument to instrument. Moreover one would need to create an appropriate calibration curve with the polymer composition of interest using appropriate molecular weight ranges and comonomer type for the preparative TREF fractions and or random copolymers used to create the calibration. There is a slight molecular weight effect. If the calibration curve is obtained from similar molecular weight ranges such effect would be essentially negligible. In some embodiments as illustrated in random ethylene copolymers and or preparative TREF fractions of random copolymers satisfy the following relationship 237.83 0.639

The above calibration equation relates the mole fraction of ethylene P to the analytical TREF elution temperature T for narrow composition random copolymers and or preparative TREF fractions of broad composition random copolymers. Tis the ATREF temperature for a random copolymer of the same composition i.e. the same comonomer type and content and the same molecular weight and having an ethylene mole fraction of P. Tcan be calculated from LnPX T from a measured Pmole fraction. Conversely Pis the ethylene mole fraction for a random copolymer of the same composition i.e. the same comonomer type and content and the same molecular weight and having an ATREF temperature of T which can be calculated from Ln P T using a measured value of T.

Once the block index BI for each preparative TREF fraction is obtained the weight average block index ABI for the whole polymer can be calculated.

Stress strain behavior in uniaxial tension is measured using ASTM D 1708 microtensile specimens. Samples are stretched with an Instron at 500 minat 21 C. Tensile strength and elongation at break are reported from an average of 5 specimens.

100 and 300 Hysteresis is determined from cyclic loading to 100 and 300 strains using ASTM D 1708 microtensile specimens with an Instron instrument. The sample is loaded and unloaded at 267 minfor 3 cycles at 21 C. Cyclic experiments at 300 and 80 C. are conducted using an environmental chamber.

The samples prepared and tested as described above were compared to two commercial shoe stiffeners Elastoform 172 ON a raised cotton fabric impregnated with latex commonly used in Toe Puffs and Fenise 130 NL a raised cotton fabric impregnated with latex commonly used in Counters each supplied by Forestali Srl. Results of the compression force and shape retention measurements are presented in Table 3.

The results shown above indicate that the inventive shoe stiffeners of the present invention offer a desirable balance of resiliency shape retention and hardness. Over a range of different hardness from about 5 to about 32 the polyolefin impregnated samples 1 4 exhibited higher resiliency greater than about 65 and higher shape retention greater than about 90 than the Fenise sample having resiliency of about 59 and shape retention between 85 and 90 . The polyolefin impregnated textiles also exhibited similar and higher resiliency and shape retention versus the Elastoform comparative sample.

Sample 4 impregnated with the VERSIFY polyolefin dispersion has similar resiliency and better shape retention for similar hardness as compared to the Elastoform sample. Textiles impregnated with ENGAGE 8200 dispersions represented by Sample A have similar shape retention and better resiliency compared to Elastoform grade for similar hardness.

Impregnation Control. As described above the amount of impregnation can be controlled by pressing the fabric between calenders removing excess material. Impregnation can additionally be controlled for example by adjusting one or more of the viscosity of the compound the concentration of the combined polymer and stabilizer in the aqueous dispersion the concentration of the filler in the compound or the polarity of the aqueous dispersion.

As an example of controlling impregnation experiments were performed to determine the amount of impregnation realized at various dispersion solids concentrations targeting a 20 weight percent impregnation with the results shown in Table 4. The dispersion used was a DP4200 PRIMACOR 5980I dispersion having an initial solids concentration of 41.4 weight percent. Fabric samples used included a Boeren Bond geophysical textile and a Don Low sr PP fabric.

An impregnated fabric sample was obtained by first immersing the fabric in the dispersion. The fabric after wetting was removed from the dispersion and the excess was allowed to drip off of the fabric. The wetted fabric was hanged vertically and dried in an oven with additional air drying as noted. For Sample 7 a three sheet composite was formed where only the middle sheet was immersed followed by drying and consolidation of the sheets.

The concentration viscosity of the dispersion used for samples 5 7 was too high to reach significantly low impregnate percentages without wiping excess off of the sheet prior to drying. Although the dispersion was too viscous to produce a sheet having 20 weight percent impregnate it was noted that the dispersion adhered very well to the fabric.

After diluting the dispersion with 50 water the dispersion adhered well and resulted in a lower degree of fabric impregnation however still exceeding the 20 weight percent target. Further dilution to 75 water 25 original dispersion the solution appeared to become too polar and dispersion flow was observed to be in domains resulting in inhomogeneous wetting of the fabric surface. The above examples illustrate that dispersion viscosity or concentration can be used to effect the degree of impregnation.

Experiment observations. Samples 6 resulted in a high clarity sheet after consolidation. In contrast Sample 7 the sandwich composite did not have good clarity after consolidation. Additionally water was observed boiling out of the composite during consolidation. A drying time of 4 minutes appeared to be sufficient the drying time for sample 9 was extended however no additional weight loss was observed after 4 minutes.
