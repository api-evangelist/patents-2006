title: Ballistic protection shelter
abstract: A ballistic protection shelter includes a soft-walled shelter structure wherein soft wall and soft roof portions are supported on at least one rigid support member, and an internal shelter structure for disposition within the soft-walled shelter structure. The internal shelter structure includes at least rigid side wall panels connectable to each other to form an enclosure. The panels are of a ballistic protective material adapted to provide protection to shelter occupants against explosive detonations and shrapnel.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

The invention relates to structures for human habitation and is directed more particularly to tent like structures for use in the field as by soldiers.

Soldiers in the field are typically housed in soft walled structures such as tents. Such structures usually include soft wall portions and soft roof portions connected together and supported by a pole or a series of poles and or frame members.

In a hostile environment the occupants of such structures have little protection against detonations and consequent shrapnel. To improve protection under such conditions high value targets may be surrounded with concrete barriers and or sand bags. Such external measures however readily identify to belligerents the high value nature of the structures so enclosed.

Accordingly there is a need for providing protection for soldiers in tents and other soft walled structures but in such a manner as to not reveal a priority target for belligerents.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide a ballistic protection shelter having the outside appearance of an ordinary tent and having internally thereof a shelter structure constructed of interconnectable rigid panels of a ballistic protective material.

With the above and other objects in view as will hereinafter appear a feature of the present invention is the provision of a ballistic protection shelter comprising a soft walled shelter structure wherein soft wall and soft roof portions are supported on at least one rigid support member and an internal shelter structure for disposition within the soft walled shelter structure. The internal shelter structure comprises at least rigid side wall panels connectable to at least one of 1 each other and 2 to the support member to form an enclosure the panels being of a ballistic protective material adapted to provide protection to shelter occupants against explosive detonations and shrapnel.

The system may also comprise interlocking rigid panels with lapped seams to maintain the integrity of the protective shielding and any sliding doors.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular shelter embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that the illustrative ballistic protection shelter includes a soft walled shelter structure or tent having soft wall portions and soft roof portions supported by rigid poles or frame assembly .

The illustrative shelter further includes an internal shelter structure including at least rigid side wall panels and preferably rigid roof panels . The rigid panels are interconnectable and or connectable to the frame assembly for quick erection within the soft walled structure . The rigid frame assembly may support the soft wall portions and the rigid side panels or the rigid side panels may stand by virtue of their own rigidity and interconnection.

The rigid panels may be interlocking with each seam being covered by a lap a sample of such lapped seam being shown in so that the lapped seams maintain the integrity of the protective shielding and any sliding doors not shown .

In small structures the frame assembly may be omitted and the soft walled structure supported by a traditional single central pole or a line of central poles. In such instances the internal shelter structure is self supporting.

There is thus provided a quickly erectable modular ballistic protective shelter which provides no obvious indication as to its hardening . The shelter illustrated in has the same appearance as the shelter of the structure of being disposed within the structure of hidden from view.

The shelters are air transportable C 130 . The rigid panels are of off the shelf light weight ballistic materials and the soft portions are of standard tent fabric. The frame assembly is of standard tent frame construction and materials.

The present invention provides protection against fragment and blast overpressure risks associated with indirect fire threats. The invention inserts into a standard military tent without any special tools it can be utilized with standard tent fabric covering it does not change the shelter s signature and it is designed to transfer the bulk of the structural loads associated with the ballistic panels directly to the ground.

It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular construction herein disclosed and or shown in the drawings but also comprises any modification or equivalent within the scope of the claims.
