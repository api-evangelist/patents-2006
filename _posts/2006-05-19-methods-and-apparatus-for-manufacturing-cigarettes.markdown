title: Methods and apparatus for manufacturing cigarettes
abstract: Cigarettes are manufactured using modified automated cigarette making apparatus. Those cigarettes possess smokable rods having paper wrapping materials having additive materials applied thereto as patterns. The additive material can be applied as a coating formulation in an off-line manner to a continuous paper sheet web that is later used for cigarette manufacture. The additive material can be applied as a coating formulation in an on-line manner to continuous paper web moving through an operating cigarette making machine. The coating formulation is applied to the paper web using roll applicator techniques, ink jet printing techniques or electrostatic precipitation techniques. Liquid coating formulation are curable, and are virtually absent of solvent or liquid carrier. Radiation, such as ultraviolet or electron beam radiation, is used to solidify and fix polymerizable liquid components of the coating formulation that have been applied to the paper web. Heating and subsequent cooling of the coating formulation used to fix solid components of the coating formulation that have been applied to the paper web. Registration techniques are used to ensure proper positioning of the additive material on the smokable rods so manufactured, and to ensure proper quality of those cigarettes.

This application is a Divisional application of and claims benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 440 219 filed on May 16 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 047 982 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present invention relates to smoking articles and in particular to equipment materials and techniques used for the manufacture of those smoking articles and components thereof. More specifically the present invention relates to the manufacture of cigarette rods and in particular to systems and methods for applying an additive material to desired locations of wrapping materials of cigarettes in an efficient effective and desired manner.

Smoking articles such as cigarettes have a substantially cylindrical rod shaped structure and include a charge roll or column of smokable material such as shredded tobacco surrounded by a paper wrapper to form a cigarette rod smokable rod or a tobacco rod. Normally a cigarette has a cylindrical filter element aligned in an end to end relationship with the tobacco rod. Typically a filter element comprises plasticized cellulose acetate tow circumscribed by a paper material known as plug wrap. Certain cigarettes incorporate filter elements comprising for example activated charcoal particles. Typically the filter element is attached to one end of the tobacco rod using a circumscribing wrapping material known as tipping paper. 

A cigarette is used by a smoker by lighting one end of that cigarette and burning the tobacco rod. The smoker then receives mainstream smoke into his or her mouth by drawing on the opposite end of the cigarette. During the time that the cigarette is not being drawn upon by the smoker the cigarette remains burning.

Numerous attempts have been made to control the manner that a cigarette burns when the cigarette is not being drawn upon. For example cigarette papers have been treated with various materials to cause cigarettes incorporating those papers to self extinguish during periods when those cigarettes are lit but are not being actively puffed. Certain treatment methods have involved applying materials to the paper in circumferential bands or longitudinal stripes creating areas that affect the burn rate of cigarettes incorporating those cigarette papers. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 030 963 to Cohn U.S. Pat. No. 4 146 040 to Cohn U.S. Pat. No. 4 489 738 to Simon U.S. Pat. No. 4 489 650 to Weinert and U.S. Pat. No. 4 615 345 to Durocher US Patent Application 2002 0185143 to Crooks et al. and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 892 834 filed Jun. 27 2001. In addition numerous references disclose applying films to the paper wrapping materials of tobacco rods. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 1 909 924 to Schweitzer U.S. Pat. No. 4 607 647 to Dashley and U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 675 to Milford et al.

 Banded paper wrapping materials that are used for cigarette manufacture possess segments defined by the composition location and properties of the various materials within those wrapping materials. Numerous references contain disclosures suggesting various banded wrapping material configurations. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 1 996 002 to Seaman U.S. Pat. No. 2 013 508 to Seaman U.S. Pat. No. 4 452 259 to Norman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 417 228 to Baldwin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 753 to Peterson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 754 to Peterson et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 198 537 to Bokelman et al. and PCT WO 02 37991 and PCT WO 03 034845. Methods for manufacturing banded type wrapping materials also have been disclosed. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 739 775 to Hampl Jr. et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 474 095 to Allen et al. and PCT WO 02 44700 and PCT WO 02 055294. Some of those references describe banded papers having segments of paper fibrous cellulosic material or particulate material adhered to a paper web. See U.S. Pat. No. 5 263 999 to Baldwin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 417 228 to Baldwin et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 450 863 to Collins et al. and U.S. Patent Application 2002 0092621 to Suzuki. Methods for manufacturing cigarettes having treated wrapping materials are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 191 906 to Myracle Jr. et al. and PCT WO 02 19848.

Additive materials can be applied to cigarette paper wrapping materials prior to the time that those wrapping materials are used for cigarette manufacture i.e. in a so called off line fashion . For certain additive material components e.g. ethylcellulose that are applied off line it has been desirable for additive materials to be applied within non aqueous solvents such as iso propyl acetate. See for example U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 303 648 filed Nov. 25 2002 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Additive materials also can be applied to cigarette paper wrapping materials during the time that those wrapping materials are used for cigarette manufacture i.e. in a so called on line fashion . For certain additive material components e.g. starch based materials that are applied on line it has been desirable for additive materials to be applied as water based formulations. See for example U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 324 837 filed Dec. 20 2002 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

It would be highly desirable to provide cigarettes having predetermined patterns of additive materials e.g. as bands applied to the wrapping materials of those cigarettes. It would be particularly desirable to apply additive materials to a continuous web of a wrapping material of a tobacco rod of a cigarette in an efficient and effective manner during the manufacture of that tobacco rod. It also would be desirable to provide a method for minimizing or avoiding the use of solvents when applying additive material to the wrapping material and it also would be desirable that such method operate effectively and be easily implemented within a conventional automated cigarette making machine of the type used to produce commercial quantities of cigarettes.

The present invention provides systems materials apparatus and processes for manufacturing smoking articles and components of those smoking articles. Of particular interest are systems apparatus and methods for manufacturing cigarettes and wrapping materials used for manufacturing cigarettes. The present invention relates to manners and methods for transferring additive material to and for retaining an additive material on desired locations of a wrapping material e.g. paper wrapping web suitable for use for smoking article manufacture. The additive material can be applied to the wrapping material and that wrapping material can be used at later times for the manufacture of smoking articles such as cigarettes. Of particular interest is the application of additive material to wrapping material during manufacture of smoking articles using an automated cigarette making machine e.g. a machine designed to produce a continuous cigarette rod . That is it is of particular interest to apply and fix an additive material to a continuously advancing strip of a paper web within a region of an automated cigarette making machine using a component of such a machine during a cigarette manufacturing process.

Certain cigarette making apparatus and systems are characterized as single component systems. A continuous paper web is provided from a source e.g. a bobbin associated with a component of such a system e.g. an unwind spindle assembly of that system . Tobacco filler and components for manufacturing a continuous cigarette rod from the tobacco filler and the continuous paper web are provided using the same component of that system e.g. using an upwardly moving air stream coupled with a conveyor system and a garniture system respectively . Such a cigarette making apparatus can be used to manufacture cigarettes from a continuous paper web that has been treated previously so that additive material e.g. a coating formulation has been applied to that paper web in an off line fashion. Such a cigarette making apparatus also can be adapted to incorporate additive application apparatus that allow application of additive material to the continuous paper web in an on line fashion.

Certain cigarette making apparatus and systems are characterized as multi component systems and in particular two component systems. A continuous paper web is provided from a source that is the first component of such a system. Tobacco filler and components for manufacturing a continuous cigarette rod from the tobacco filler and the continuous paper web supplied by the first component are provided using the second component of that system. For preferred two component systems the two components are independent stand alone units. Such cigarette making apparatus can be adapted to incorporate additive application apparatus that provide ways to apply additive material to the continuous paper web in an on line fashion.

Certain cigarette making apparatus and systems characterized as multi component systems can be three component systems. A continuous paper web is provided from a source that is the first component of such a system. A continuous paper web is supplied by the first component of the system and the first component can be adapted to incorporate an additive application apparatus in order that a coating formulation can be applied to the paper web. Tobacco filler and components for manufacturing a continuous cigarette rod from the tobacco filler is carried out using the second component of that system. The third component of the system is positioned between the first and second components and can be used to apply coating formulation to the paper web that is supplied by the first component. The third component of the system also is adapted so that the continuous paper web passes from that third component to the second component of the system for cigarette manufacture. For preferred three component systems the three components are independent stand alone units. Such a cigarette making apparatus can be used to apply additive material to the continuous paper web in an on line fashion.

Equipment and methods for applying additive material to a substrate such as a continuous strip of paper web used as a wrapping material for cigarette manufacture can be employed to apply additive material as a predetermined pattern to the paper web during operation of an automated cigarette making machine. The additive material can be applied to desired locations on the paper web using suitably positioned and controlled application devices that can apply the additive material in either a contact or non contact manner. A contact application device is used to apply additive material to the paper web by transferring the additive material from a surface of that device that involves an action of physical touching of the some portion of that device with the paper web. Contact application devices include roller type applicator devices screen printing devices and the like. Non contact or non impact application devices are used to apply additive material to the paper web by projecting additive material from one region to the paper web such as is carried out using spraying techniques electrostatic deposition techniques or the like.

In one aspect the present invention relates to equipment and methods for applying an additive material to a substrate such as a paper web used as a wrapping material for cigarette manufacture. Those equipment and methods are particularly suitable in connection with the operation of an automated cigarette making machine and for the purpose of applying a predetermined pattern of additive material to a continuous strip of paper web. As such a suitable method for applying additive material to a web of wrapping material most preferably in an on line fashion is provided.

An additive application apparatus that can be used to apply various types of additive materials having fluid forms to a continuously advancing substrate such as a moving strip of paper web within a cigarette making machine includes an outer housing and an inner gear. The outer housing is wheel like rotatable and possesses an outer surface and an inner region. The inner region possesses i a reservoir for additive material ii an inner face possessing gear teeth and iii a passageway for passage of fluid from the inner region to the outer surface. The inner gear is a rotatable gear having gear teeth and is located within the housing. The gear teeth of the housing and the inner gear are in a cooperating arrangement with one another that is the gear teeth of the housing and inner gear are meshed in an operative arrangement. Rotation of the inner gear relative to the housing is driven by a suitable power source. Rotation of the outer housing causes additive material within the reservoir to be transferred to trough regions between adjacent gear teeth of the inner region of the outer housing that is during rotation of the inner gear and outer housing additive material is picked up on regions of the gear face of the outer housing from the reservoir. Rotation of the inner gear also is such that cooperation of the gear teeth of the rotatable gear and the housing cause additive material within trough regions between adjacent gear teeth of the outer housing to be forced through the passageways. That is meshing of the gear teeth and the configuration of meshed gear teeth in the region of each passageway provide pumping action resulting in a forcing of the additive material carried within a trough region between adjacent gear teeth of the outer housing through those passageways. Such an apparatus is used in conjunction with a cigarette making machine in order to apply an additive material having a fluid form to a continuous strip of paper web that is arranged so as to move past that apparatus and contact a portion of the outer surface of housing. As such additive material that is forced through the passageways of the rotating housing is applied at desired locations on the paper web. Preferred additive materials are applied as fluid coating formulations including those that are virtually free of solvents or liquid carriers and those that incorporate solvents or liquid carriers e.g. aqueous liquids .

Another additive application apparatus includes a first roller adapted to receive the additive material e.g. a coating formulation in liquid form and a second roller adjacent to the first roller adapted to transfer the additive material from the first roller to a substrate e.g. continuous advancing paper web . That apparatus also includes an additive material reservoir adjacent to the first roller for containing the additive material and for supplying the additive material to the first roller. The additive material so supplied is positioned on the roll face of the first roller. For that apparatus the roll faces of protruding dies extending from the second roller are in roll contact with the roll face of the first roller in one location and the roll faces of the protruding dies of the second roller are in contact with the paper web in another location thus allowing for a predetermined transfer of additive material in a two step manner. That is when the additive material is supplied to the roll face of the first roller that additive material is transferred to the roll face of the protruding dies of the second roller and when those dies possessing additive material on their roll faces contact the advancing paper web the additive material is transferred from the roll face of the protruding dies of the second roller and applied to the advancing paper web.

Another additive application apparatus includes a first roller adapted to receive the additive material e.g. a coating formulation in liquid form and adapted to transfer the additive material to a substrate e.g. a continuous advancing paper web . The paper web passes between the roll faces of the first roller and a second roller. That apparatus also includes an additive material reservoir adjacent to the first roller for containing the additive material and for supplying the additive material to the first roller. The additive material so supplied is positioned on the roll face of the first roller. For that apparatus the roll faces of protrusions or cams extending from the second roller are in roll contact with the roll face of the first roller and the paper web passes between those roll faces such that both rollers are periodically in contact with the paper web thus allowing for a predetermined transfer of additive material to the paper web from the roll face of the first roller when the roll faces of the protruding cams of the second roller cause the application of force to the paper web. That is when the additive material is supplied to the roll face of the first roller that additive material is transferred to pre determined locations on the surface of the paper web when the protruding cause of the second roller cause the paper web to be pushed against the roll face of the first roller.

An additive material which can have the form of a coating formulation is applied to a paper wrapping material for cigarette manufacture. Certain preferred coating formulations that are applied to wrapping materials e.g. paper webs incorporate relatively low levels of solvent or liquid carrier. Highly preferred coating formulations are essentially absent of solvent or liquid carrier and most highly preferred coating formulations are virtually free of solvent or liquid carrier. Representative additive application techniques that are useful for applying generally liquid type coating formulations or those types of formulations having the form of liquid dispersions can involve the use of either contact types of printing devices e.g. roll applicators or non contact digital printing types of application systems e.g. ink jet type printing devices . Representative additive application techniques that are useful for applying coating formulations having generally solid forms can involve the use of non contact printing types of application systems such as electrostatic deposition type printing devices.

A wrapping material having coating formulation applied thereto can be subjected to processing steps that cause certain components of that formulation to form a type of film that is in intimate contact with that wrapping material. Typically a fluid coating formulation incorporating an aqueous solvent or liquid carrier is applied to the paper wrapping material and is subjected to exposure conditions sufficient to evaporate that solvent or liquid carrier and hence provide a dry film that is fixed in intimate contact with the paper. Typically a coating formulation incorporating pre polymer components that typically have a fluid form is applied to the paper wrapping material and is subjected to exposure to suitable radiation e.g. ultraviolet or electron beam radiation of a type and in a manner sufficient to cause the pre polymer components to undergo polymerization and hence solidify e.g. be cured and hence the resulting polymer forms a solid type of film that is fixed in intimate contact with the paper. Alternatively a coating formulation incorporating finely divided solid form components is applied to the paper wrapping material e.g. using electrostatic deposition techniques and is subjected to further processing conditions e.g. the application of heat followed by cooling so as to cause certain components of that formulation to form a film which then solidifies and hence the resulting polymeric film is fixed e.g. fused in intimate contact with the paper. Preferably the coating formulation is applied to a continuous advancing strip of paper web and the resulting coated paper web is used as wrapping material for smokable material e.g. for the manufacture of a cigarette rod .

A registration system can control in an on line fashion the location of the applied pattern e.g. bands of additive material on the wrapping material to the location of that pattern on the smoking article that is manufactured. The application of each band can be controlled relative to the speed at which the cigarette making machine is operated and the location of each band can be timed to the operation of the additive applicator system and to the operation of the cutting device e.g. flying knife that cuts the continuous rod into cigarette rods of predetermined length. In addition a servo control system incorporating a multi axes programming unit can be used to facilitate adjustments resulting from changes in the length the paper web during travel between the applicator system and the cutting device.

An inspection system can be used to ensure the quality of the treated paper web and the smoking articles manufactured therefrom. The system possesses a detector e.g. a capacitance detector for detecting information regarding the electrical properties of the web and for generating responsive electrical signals. The system further includes circuitry for processing those electrical signals to determine information relating to the presence of the pattern on the web and for generating output signals. The system further includes computing logic for receiving the output signals and for determining whether those signals are representative of an unacceptable irregular pattern on the web or of an acceptable desired pattern. The system further includes computer logic for receiving information regarding irregular patterns and for signaling rejection of component materials e.g. formed cigarettes manufactured from wrapping materials possessing that have been determined to possess irregular patterns.

As will be realized by those of skill in the art many different embodiments of the foregoing are possible. Additional uses objects advantages and novel features of the present invention are set forth in the detailed description that follows and will become more apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following disclosure or by practice of the invention.

Like components are given like numeric designations throughout the figures.

A conventional automated cigarette rod making machine useful in carrying out the present invention is of the type commercially available from Molins PLC or Hauni Werke Korber Co. KG. For example cigarette rod making machines of the type known as Mk8 commercially available from Molins PLC or PROTOS commercially available from Hauni Werke Korber Co. KG can be employed and can be suitably modified in accordance with the present invention. A description of a PROTOS cigarette making machine is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 4 474 190 to Brand at col. 5 line 48 through col. 8 line 3 which is incorporated herein by reference. Types of equipment suitable for the manufacture of cigarettes also are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4 844 100 to Holznagel U.S. Pat. No. 5 156 169 to Holmes et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 191 906 to Myracle Jr. et al. and PCT WO 02 19848. Designs of various components of cigarette making machines and the various materials used to manufacture those components will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette making machinery design and operation.

Referring to a one component cigarette making machine assembly includes cigarette making machine . The cigarette making machine includes a chimney region that provides a source of tobacco filler or other smoking material. The tobacco filler is provided continuously within an upwardly moving air stream shown by arrow and is blown onto the lower outside surface of a continuous a conveyor system . The conveyor system includes an endless porous formable conveyor belt that is supported and driven at each end by left roller and right roller . A low pressure region or suction chamber within the foraminous belt acts to attract and retain tobacco filler against the bottom of the conveyor system . As such tobacco filler located below the conveyor belt is pulled upward toward that belt thereby forming the tobacco filler into a tobacco stream or cake on the lower surface of that belt. The conveyor belt thus conveys the stream of tobacco filler to the left toward a garniture section of the cigarette making machine . An ecreteur or trimmer disc assembly assists in providing transfer of the appropriate amount of tobacco filler to the garniture region . Descriptions of the components and operation of several types of chimneys tobacco filler supply equipment and suction conveyor systems are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 3 288 147 to Molins et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 574 816 to Rudszinat U.S. Pat. No. 4 736 754 to Heitmann et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 878 506 to Pinck et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 665 to Heitmann U.S. Pat. No. 5 012 823 to Keritsis et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 360 751 to Fagg et al.

Meanwhile a continuous web of paper wrapping material is supplied from a bobbin . The bobbin is supported and rotated using an unwind spindle assembly .

The paper web is routed on a desired path using a series of idler rollers and guideposts shown as rollers through an optional printing assembly device and ultimately through the garniture region . Typically product indicia are printed onto the paper web at predetermined regions thereof using printing assembly . Printing assemblies for printing product indicia e.g. logos in gold colored print are component parts of commercially available machines and the selection and operation thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette making machine design and operation. Techniques for registering the location of printed product indicia on the ultimate cigarette product e.g. on the paper wrapper of a cigarette rod in a location immediately adjacent to the tipping material of that product are known to those skilled in the art of automated cigarette manufacture.

The paper web also is routed through an applicator system prior to the time that the web reaches the garniture section . The applicator system is employed to apply a desired pattern of additive material to the paper web . A representative pattern is provided by applying spaced bands that are aligned transversely to the longitudinal axis of the paper web . A representative additive material is a coating formulation having a fluid form and representative coating formulations that have fluid forms can have the form of liquids syrups pastes emulsions or dispersions or slurries of solid materials within any of the foregoing.

Optionally the paper web can be routed through a heating cooling control unit not shown immediately before the paper web passes through the applicator system . A suitable heating cooling unit is a heating unit having the form of an infrared heater not shown and that heater can be operated at any desired temperature for example at a temperature of about 180 C. to about 220 C. The heating cooling unit can be used to provide the paper web at a desired temperature e.g. the paper web can be pre heated immediately prior to application of the additive material formulation to the surface of that paper web.

A representative additive applicator is a contact type applicator that comprises a pick up roller and a transfer roller . The pick up roller includes a plurality of patterned e.g. evenly spaced apart pockets on its roll face not shown into which a predetermined amount of additive is deposited. The positioning shape and number of pockets can vary and typically depends upon the pattern that is desired to be applied to the paper web e.g. spaced apart pockets can be used to place spaced bands of additive material on the web . For example in one embodiment of a transfer roller seven pockets each having the form of transversely aligned bands each placed about 46 mm apart. The shape including depth of each pocket can determine the amount of additive material that can be carried by that pocket and hence applied to the paper web .

The additive material typically is provided from a supply source reservoir not shown through tubing or other suitable supply means not shown to a port or supply region near the head i.e. infeed region of the pick up roller . The additive material is fed from the head of the pick up roller into the pockets of the pick up roller.

If desired the supply region and the region of the pick up roller and other relevant regions of the additive applicator can be supplied with heat control system using a suitable heating or cooling device not shown . As such a heating device can provide a heated region that can be used to assist in maintaining a solid or very viscous coating formulation in a melted form or fluid form e.g. the form of a liquid a syrup a paste an emulsion or a dispersion or slurry of solid materials within any of the foregoing . A representative heating device is an electrical resistance heating unit controlled by a rheostat and the heating device can be appropriately fashioned so as to transfer the desired amount of heat to the various components of the additive applicator . As such sufficient heat can be provided to provide coating formulation at a temperature above ambient temperature and for example at a temperature within the range of about 120 F. to about 180 F. If desired heat insulation material not shown can be positioned in adjacent regions of the cigarette making machine in order that transfer of heat to other regions of that machine is minimized or prevented.

Operation of the pick up roller and the transfer roller are timed and controlled relative to the speed of operation of the cigarette making machine . As the pick up roller and the transfer roller are engaged in roll contact and rotate in contact with each other in a controlled manner the additive material is transferred from the pockets of the pick up roller onto predetermined regions of the roll face surface not shown of the transfer roller . The additive material is transferred onto the transfer roller surface in essentially the same pattern as that of the spaced apart pockets on the pick up roller i.e. the pattern applied to the paper web is dictated by the design of the pattern of the roll face of the pick up roller .

Representative types of contact type applicators are described in greater detail hereinafter with reference to . Those types of applicators can be suitably incorporated into the cigarette making machine assembly .

The paper web comprises two major surfaces an inside surface and an outside surface . The stream of tobacco filler ultimately is deposited upon the inside surface of the paper web and the additive material most preferably also is applied to the inside surface of that web. As the paper web travels across the surface of the rotating transfer roller the additive material on the surface of the transfer roller is transferred to the inside surface of the advancing paper web at locations corresponding to the location of the pockets located on the roll face of the pick up roller .

After the additive material has been applied to the paper web the web can be exposed to a sensor or detector for a measurement system such as an inspection system not shown . Preferably the detector is mounted on the frame of the cigarette making machine and is positioned so as to receive information concerning the paper web immediately after additive material has been applied to that paper web. Typically the detector is a component of certain registration systems and inspection systems. Types of sensors detectors and inspection system components and description of inspection system technologies and operation thereof are set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 324 837 filed Dec. 20 2002. Alternative sensors detectors and inspection system components and description of inspection system technologies and methods of operation are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4 845 374 to White et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 966 218 to Bokelman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 020 969 to Struckhoff et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 198 537 to Bokelman et al. which are incorporated herein by reference.

A representative inspection system employs a capacitance detector positioned downstream from the applicator system . A preferred detector is a non contact detector that can sense changes in the dielectric field of the paper web resulting from the application of additive material to certain regions of that paper web. A representative detector is a Hauni Loose End Detector Part Number 2942925CD001500000 that is available from Hauni Werke Korber Co. KG. The detector is combined with appropriate electronics for signal processing. That is the detector generates an electrical signal and appropriate electronic circuitry is used to compare that signal relative to a programmed threshold level. Such a signal allows for graphical display of the profile of applied additive material along the length of the paper web. When application of a band of additive material does not occur as desired i.e. a band is missing on the paper web or the amount of additive material that is applied is not the desired amount a signal is generated. As such rejection of poor quality rods and adjustments to the overall operation of the cigarette making machine can occur. In addition an output signal from such a measurement system can be used in a feedback control system to maintain the desired level of additive material to the paper web and or to maintain the desired rate of feed of coating formulation to the applicator system.

Additionally after the additive material has been applied to the paper web the web can be passed through an optional heating cooling control device . The control device can be used to alter the heat to which the paper web and additive material is subjected e.g. by raising or lowering temperature . For example the heating cooling control device can be a heating or drying device adapted to assist in the removal of solvent e.g. moisture from the additive material that has been applied to the paper web . Alternatively for example the heating cooling control device can be a cooling device adapted to assist in the hardening melted additive material that has been applied to the paper web using a heated additive applicator system . Typically the heating cooling control device has a tunnel type configuration through which the paper web is passed and during the time that the paper web is present within that tunnel region the paper web is subjected to heating supplied by a convection or radiant heating device or cooling supplied by a refrigerant type solid carbon dioxide type or liquid nitrogen type cooling device.

Typically the region of the cigarette making machine where the heating cooling device is located does not afford sufficient room to provide a heating cooling control device of any appreciable size. For this reason it is desirable to locate such an optional heating cooling device in a location that is offset from the cigarette making machine. For example appropriately located and positioned turning bars not shown can be used to direct the paper web outward and optionally upward or downward from the front face of the cigarette making machine and the paper web can be routed through the heating cooling device that can be supported but frame or other suitable support means not shown and appropriately located and positioned turning bars not shown can be used to direct the paper web so subjected to heating or cooling back to the cigarette making machine for continued use in the cigarette manufacturing process.

The paper web having certain types of additive materials applied thereto is subjected to exposure to appropriate radiation. That is coating formulations incorporating pre polymer components can be exposed to suitable radiation of a type and in a manner sufficient to cause the pre polymer components to undergo polymerization reactions and hence solidify. At least one radiation source is positioned so as to subject the paper web having additive material applied thereto to exposure to radiation. Typical radiation sources can provide radiation for example in the ultraviolet uv range or radiation in the form of electron beam radiation i.e. gamma radiation . For paper web having pre polymer components not shown applied thereto heating cooling control device also can be replaced with a source of radiation in order to provide for exposure of the coating formulation on the paper web to radiation that causes polymerization and hence solidification of the additive material. A reflective shield or cover not shown can be positioned over that radiation source in order to ensure that radiation is directed toward the coating formulation positioned on the paper web and in order to minimize or prevent emission of radiation to undesired locations within the environment near the cigarette making machine assembly . If desired the atmosphere within the shield or cover not shown can be controlled e.g. by flushing the region with dry nitrogen gas .

Optionally though not preferably the indicia printing assembly can be modified in order to print formulations other than printing inks and intended for purposes other than product indicia. For example the printing assembly can be adapted to apply coating formulations having intended purposes other than product indicia. For example fluid coating formulations e.g. that incorporate pre polymer components and are essentially absent of solvent or that are water based can be applied to either the inside surface or outside surface of the paper web using a suitably adapted printing assembly . Such coating formulations can be supplied using a pump or other suitable means not shown from a reservoir not shown through a tube or other suitable supply means not shown . The paper web having water based additive material not shown applied thereto is subjected to exposure to heat or microwave radiation using heat source in order to dry the coating formulation and fix additive material to the desired location on the paper web. For paper web having pre polymer components not shown applied thereto the heat source is replaced with a source of suitable radiation in order to provide for exposure of the coating formulation on the paper web to radiation that causes solidification of the additive material. A reflective shield or cover not shown can be positioned over that radiation source . The previously described heating cooling control device and or the radiation source also can be employed.

The paper web travels toward the garniture region of the cigarette making machine . The garniture region includes an endless formable garniture conveyor belt . That garniture conveyor belt conveys the paper web around a roller underneath a finger rail assembly and advances that paper web over and through a garniture entrance cone . The entrance cone also extends beyond e.g. downstream from the finger rail assembly . The right end of the garniture conveyor belt is positioned adjacent to and beneath the left end of the suction conveyor system in order that the stream of tobacco filler carried by conveyor belt is deposited on the paper web in that region. The finger rail assembly and garniture entrance cone combine to provide a way to guide movement of an advancing tobacco filler cake from the suction conveyor to the garniture region . Selection and use of finger rail assemblies and garniture entrance cones will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette manufacture. Alternatively it is possible to employ those finger rail assemblies and or modified garniture entrance cones that are set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 324 837 filed Dec. 20 2002.

As the conveyor belt and tobacco filler cake travel within the finger rail assembly vacuum suction applied to the inside region of the conveyor belt is released. As a result tobacco filler is released from contact with the conveyor belt falls downwardly from that conveyor belt through a longitudinally extending track not shown within the finger rail assembly and is deposited onto the advancing paper web at the left side of the garniture region immediately below the finger rail assembly. In conjunction with the release of vacuum from the conveyor belt removal of tobacco filler from the conveyor belt and deposit of that tobacco filler onto the moving paper web is facilitated through the use of a shoe or scrape or other suitable means that is used to peel or otherwise physically remove advancing tobacco filler off of the outer surface of the extreme left end of the conveyor belt .

The garniture section includes a tongue adjacent to the distal end of the finger rail assembly and above the top surface of the garniture conveyor belt . The tongue provides a commencement of constriction of the tobacco filler that has been deposited on the paper web . Meanwhile the garniture conveyor belt begins to form that tobacco filler stream and paper web into a continuous rod . The tongue extends to a point where the paper web is secured around that stream of tobacco filler. The tongue and the garniture conveyor belt define a passage which progressively decreases in cross section in the direction of movement of the tobacco filler stream such that the deposited tobacco filler stream progressively forms a substantially circular cross section that is desired for the ultimate finished continuous cigarette rod .

The garniture section also includes a folding mechanism on each side of the garniture conveyor belt located adjacent to and downstream from the tongue . The folding mechanism is aligned in the direction of filler stream movement further compresses the tobacco filler within the rod that is being formed and folds the paper web around the advancing components of the forming continuous cigarette rod . A fashioned continuous tobacco rod that exits the tongue and folding mechanism then passes through an adhesive applicator in order that adhesive is applied to the exposed length or lap seam region of the paper web i.e. side seam adhesive is applied to the paper web . That is the exposed length of paper web then is lapped onto itself and the adhesive is set that region in order to secure the paper web around the tobacco filler thereby forming the continuous cigarette rod . The continuous rod passes through a cutting or subdivision mechanism and this subdivided into a plurality of rods each of the desired length. The selection and operation of suitable subdivision mechanisms and the components thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette manufacture. For example the cutting speed of knife not shown within a ledger or other suitable guide is controlled to correspond to the speed that the cigarette making machine is operated. That is the location that an angled flying knife not shown cuts the continuous rod into a plurality of rods each of essentially equal length is controlled by controlling the speed of operation of that knife relative to speed that the cigarette making machine supplies the continuous rod.

Typically operation of the conveyor belt garniture belt and flying knife not shown within ledger all are mechanically linked to one another by belts or other suitable means and are driven off of the same power source not shown . For example for a cigarette making machine such as a PROTOS that is commercially available from Hauni Werke Korber Co. KG the main motor of that cigarette making machine is used to drive operation of the conveyor belt the garniture belt and the flying knife. An alternate design of such a type of cigarette making machine can be provided by providing power to the flying knife from one power source such as the motor of a servo system not shown and the power to the garniture belt and the conveyor belt can be provided from a second power source such as the motor of a second servo system not shown . Typically power for operation of the garniture belt is provided by suitable mechanical connection to the second power source and the power for operation of the conveyor belt is provided by suitable linkage to the operation of the garniture belt by suitably adapted timing belt systems or other suitable means not shown . Encoders not shown mechanically coupled to the first and second servo systems not shown provide information to a processing unit not shown regarding cigarette manufacturing speed and garniture speed respectively. The detector e.g. such as a non contact ultrasonic detector also can be adapted to provide information regarding location of additive material that has been applied to the paper web to the same processing unit not shown . Using the processing unit the positioning of applied pattern on the paper web can be compared to a specified positioning of the pattern and the processing unit can be used to alter the speed of operation of the two servo systems relative to one another to bring cigarette rods that are out of specification back to within specification. For example the speed of operation of the flying knife can be increased and or the speed of operation of the garniture belt can be decreased until cigarette rods are determined to be back within the desired range of tolerance or within specification.

Servo control systems and the operation thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette making machine design and operation. Representative servo systems are readily available as Single Axis Controller P N DKC03.3 040 7FW FWA EDODR3 FGP 04VRS MS Motor P N MKD025 144 KP1 KN SERVO MOTOR from Indramat Ultra 5000 Single Axis P N 2098 IPD 010 Motor P N Y 2012 1 H00AA from Allen Bradly and Servo P N SC752A 001 01 Motor P N R34 GENA HS NG NV 00 from Pacific Scientific.

Information concerning the position and speed of operation of the flying knife can be fed to a servo control system that incorporates a multi axes programming unit. Such a servo system is available as PPC R02 2N N N1 V2 NN FW from Indramat. As such the servo system can be used to observe and control the transfer roller to a known position relative to the flying knife. Preferred cigarette making machines such as PROTOS machines can possess an automatic servo driven print displacement control systems as well as servo driven paper tension control systems. Thus the distance of travel of the paper web between the applicator system and the continuous cigarette rod cutoff knife can be changed for example when adjustments are made to correct for print displacement relative to the cut in the continuous rod or to control paper tension to avoid paper breakage. Such changes in distance of travel of the paper web can vary and for example the changes of as much as 35 mm in paper travel can be provided for adjustments for print displacement and changes of as much as 20 mm in paper travel can be provided for paper tension adjustments. Thus when any adjustments are made that result in a change in the length of the path of travel of the paper web from the applicator roller to the flying knife the multi axes control system can be used to make the corresponding adjustments to the speed of operation of the applicator roller. Most preferably adjustments to the speed of operation of the applicator roller are provided at times when the applicator roller is not in the process of applying additive material to the paper web. As such adjustments programmed to occur between the application of successive bands result in avoiding smearing of additive material on the paper web and in avoiding paper breakage. To minimize the number of reject cigarettes adjustments can be made on a single rod resulting in only a single rejected rod or adjustments can be made as small changes spread out over a number of cigarette rods until the application system in adjusted to be back to providing cigarettes having patterns applied at the desired locations.

Those cigarette rods then most preferably have filter elements not shown attached thereto using known components techniques and equipment not shown . For example the cigarette making machine can be suitably coupled to filter tipping machine not shown such as a machine available as a MAX MAX S or MAX 80 Hauni Werke Korber Co. KG. See also for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 308 600 to Erdmann et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4 280 187 to Reuland et al.

The cigarette making machine assembly and configuration described with reference to are representative of a single cigarette making machine that provides both the tobacco filler and the patterned paper web to the garniture region of that machine. Cigarette making machine assemblies and configurations representative of those that provide the tobacco filler to the garniture region from one location and the patterned paper web to the garniture region from another location i.e. multi component systems are described with reference to and .

Referring to there is shown a two component automated cigarette making machine assembly that is constructed by coupling a wrapping material supply machine e.g. a first component with a cigarette making machine e.g. a second component .

A suitable wrapping material supply machine can be provided by appropriately modifying a web supply unit available as SE from Hauni Werke Korber Co. KG. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 156 169 to Holmes et al. which is incorporated herein by reference. Other suitable unwind units such those having the types of components set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 966 218 to Bokelman et al. also can be employed. The supply machine most preferably is a free standing machine that is capable of providing a patterned web of wrapping material to a conventional or suitably modified cigarette making machine . The supply machine includes a frame that supports at least one unwind spindle assembly onto which a first bobbin is mounted. Preferably the supply machine includes a second unwind spindle assembly for a second bobbin not shown and a web splicing mechanism .

The paper web is threaded through a tension sensor which in conjunction with a braking component connected to the shaft of the unwind spindle assembly maintains a desired amount of tension on the paper web as it is transferred from the bobbin .

In operation a continuous paper web supplied from a bobbin is routed through a path defined by a series of idler rollers and guideposts . The paper web also is routed through an applicator system that is used to apply a desired pattern of additive material to the paper web . Representative additive materials are coating formulations that have fluid forms can have the form of liquids syrups pastes emulsions or dispersions or slurries of solid materials within any of the foregoing. Optionally though not preferably the paper web can be routed through a heating cooling control unit not shown immediately before the paper web passes through the applicator system .

A representative additive applicator comprises a pick up roller and a transfer roller and can be operated in essentially the same manner as described previously with reference to . The additive material typically is provided from a supply source reservoir not shown through tubing e.g. Tygon type tubing or other suitable supply means not shown to a port or supply region near the head i.e. infeed region of the pick up roller . If desired the supply region and the region of the pick up roller can be supplied with heat using a suitable heating device not shown . The additive material is fed from the head of the pick up roller into the pockets of the pick up roller. As the pick up roller and the transfer roller are engaged in roll contact and rotate in contact with each other the additive material is transferred from the pockets of the pick up roller onto predetermined regions of the roll face surface not shown of the transfer roller . The additive material is transferred onto the transfer roller surface in essentially the same pattern as that of the spaced apart pockets on the pick up roller i.e. the pattern on the paper web is defined by that pattern on the roll face of the pick up roller . Representative types of additive application systems are described in greater detail hereinafter with reference to . The additive material most preferably also is applied to predetermined locations on the inside surface of the paper web .

After the additive material has been applied to the paper web the web can be exposed to a sensor or detector for a registration system and or an inspection system not shown . Preferably the detector is positioned so as to receive information concerning the paper web immediately after additive material has been applied to that paper web. Typically the detector is used in conjunction with the certain registration systems and inspection systems and in conjunction with suitable marker components that are incorporated as components of the additive material . Representative types of sensors detectors and inspection system components and description of inspection system technologies and operation thereof have been set forth hereinbefore with reference to . Components associated with registration and inspection also can be positioned elsewhere within the machine assembly . The exact location of such components can depend upon operational factors and the positioning such components can be a matter of design choice.

Additionally after the additive material has been applied to the paper web i.e. downstream from the applicator apparatus the web can be passed through an optional heating cooling control device or other suitable means for controlling heat to which the paper web is subjected. The control device can be used to alter the heat to which the paper web and additive material is subjected e.g. by raising or lowering the temperature . For example the control device can be a heating or drying device adapted to assist in the removal of solvent e.g. moisture from the additive material that has been applied to the paper web . Alternatively for example the heating cooling control device can be a cooling device adapted to assist in the hardening melted additive material that has been applied to the paper web using a heated additive applicator system . Typically the heating cooling control device has a tunnel type configuration through which the paper web is passed through an inlet end and out an outlet end and during the time that the paper web is present within that tunnel region the paper web is subjected to heating supplied using infrared convection or radiant heating devices or cooling supplied using refrigerant type solid carbon dioxide type or liquid nitrogen type cooling devices.

The size of the heating cooling device can vary particularly because that device is positioned and supported by a component that is physically separated from and spaced from the cigarette making machine . That is there is provided sufficient room to subject the paper web to treatment using the heating cooling device . Exemplary heating cooling devices have lengths of about 2 feet to about 10 feet with lengths of about 3 feet to about 8 feet being typical and lengths of about 4 feet to about 7 feet being desirable. The distance that the paper web travels through the heating cooling device i.e. the length of travel through that device can vary. For example the paper web can be routed back and forth within the heating cooling device using a suitably adapted roller system configuration not shown .

The heating cooling control device can be used to provide radiant heating to the paper web and hence evaporate solvent e.g. water present in those coating formulations that are water based. An exemplary heating and drying system is available as IMS Model No. P24N002KA02 2 kW 2450 MHz Linear Drying System from Industrial Microwave Systems Inc. Representative types of radiant drying systems are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 958 275 to Joines et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 998 774 to Joines et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 075 232 to Joines et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 087 642 to Joines et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 246 037 to Drozd et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 259 077 to Drozd et al. all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Such types of radiant drying systems can be manufactured from materials such aluminum and aluminum alloys. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 563 644 to Isganitis et al. which is incorporated herein by reference.

For the evaporation of solvent radiant type drying systems are preferred because typical infrared type drying systems require relatively long residence times to adequately remove effective quantities of solvent or liquid carrier e.g. water from the paper web . For fast moving paper webs running at nominal cigarette making machine speeds the application of sufficient heat demands the need for relatively long infrared type drying apparatus. Additionally sufficient heat from infrared type drying systems requires the use of relatively high temperatures thus providing the propensity for scorching and browning of certain areas of the paper web and the risk of fire. For example for a conventional cigarette making machine operating so as to produce about 8 000 cigarette rods per minute and having bands of additive material applied to the advancing paper web so that about 1 mg of water is applied to each individual cigarette rod about 350 to about 700 watts per hour is effectively required to remove that water from the paper web.

A microwave type drying system is desirable because effectively high amounts of heat can be employed in controlled manners. An exemplary system is one that employs planar wave guide of about 36 inches in length an internal width of about 1.6 inches and an internal depth of about 3.7 inches. More preferred systems are those that employ planar wave guides of either about 54 inches about 75 inches or about 96 inches of total length. Preferred wave guides are of dimension to allow passage of only lowest order i.e. TE or single mode radiation. An exemplary system also can possess inlet and outlet ends that both have widths of about 1.75 inch and heights of about 0.37 inch. Within the inner region of the drying system immediately within each end of the inlet and outlet ends are positioned choke flanges pin chokes not shown or other means to assist in the prevention of escape or leakage of radiation from the system and those flanges or pins typically extent about 3 inches into the system from each respective end.

Microwave type drying systems can apply heat to desirable locations on the paper web where heat is needed i.e. in the printed regions of the paper web . In one preferred radiant type drying system microwave energy is launched at one end of a waveguide and is reflected at the other end of that waveguide resulting in the paper web experiencing radiant energy for effectively an extended period. Precise drying control can be achieved by attenuating the microwave energy and or the path of the paper web within the microwave drying system. Such radiant type drying systems thus can be used to evaporate the solvent or liquid carrier e.g. water of the additive material formulations by applying the microwave energy uniformly throughout the patterned region e.g. to the bands of applied additive material coating formulation .

The controls for the radiant type dryer e.g. the microwave control and associated safety systems most preferably are integrated into the programmable logic controller based PLC based control system not shown for supervisory control. The PLC based system not shown enables radiant energy production and disables the radiant energy production when radiant energy is not needed for drying e.g. such as when the production system is stopped or paper web experiences a break . The top and bottom regions of the wave guide of the drying system in portions of the drying region can be perforated with a plurality of perforations not shown to allow for the removal of moisture without allowing radiation e.g. microwave radiation from escaping into the surroundings. A suitably designed shroud and an electrically driven fan not shown can be placed over the top of those perforations in order to remove the evaporated moisture away from the paper web and remove dust from the system. If desired the fan not shown also can be under the control of the PLC based system and as such only operate during operation of the cigarette manufacturing system .

For a radiant heating system for the embodiment shown in radiant microwave energy is supplied by a generator for electromagnetic radiation which is located one end of that system. Typically higher power generators are used to produce heat to remove greater amounts of moisture and generators producing up to about 10 kW of power and usually up to about 6 kW of power are suitable for most applications. Radiation produced by the generator is passed through appropriate wave guides and circulators not shown . The microwave radiation passes through a curved wave guide and through a drying region for the paper web . A typical drying region for a microwave drying system has a length of about 30 inches. As such the radiation supplied to the drying system and the paper web move in the same overall direction through that drying system. Radiation that travels through the drying region is reflected by suitable reflector i.e. a short plate or reflector plate at the other end of the drying system. That radiation is reflected back through the drying region back through the channel at the other end of the heating system and as such the reflected radiation and the paper web move in an overall counter current manner relative to one another. Any remaining radiation is appropriately redirected through appropriately positioned wave guides and circulators to a dry air cooled load or other suitable radiation dissipation means. As such the radiation is converted to heat and the resulting heat can be removed using electrical fans not shown or other suitable means.

In a preferred embodiment not shown the positioning of the heating device shown in is reversed e.g. the heating device is rotated 180 such that the paper web enters at the end of the heating device possessing the reflector and exits at the end through which radiation enters the channel from the generator . As such radiation entering the drying system from the source of radiation and the paper web travel in an overall counter current manner relative to one another. It also is possible to position two or more of those types of heating devices in series not shown so as to provide a manner for subjecting the paper web to prolonged exposure to radiation.

The paper web having certain types of additive materials applied thereto is subjected to exposure to radiation capable of causing components of the additive materials to undergo polymerization. Typical types of radiation that are suitable for such a purpose include ultraviolet uv and electron beam radiation. That is coating formulations incorporating pre polymer components can be exposed to suitable radiation of a type and in a manner sufficient to cause the pre polymer components to undergo polymerization reactions and hence solidify. For the treatment of those types of coating formulations applied thereto the heating cooling control device is replaced with a source of radiation in order to provide for exposure of the coating formulation on the paper web to radiation that causes solidification of the additive material. A suitably designed reflective shield shroud or cover can be positioned over that radiation source in order to ensure that radiation is directed toward the coating formulation positioned on the paper web and in order to minimize or prevent emission of radiation to undesired locations within the environment near the cigarette making machine assembly .

The additive applicator used in conjunction with the supply machine most preferably is driven by a servo drive control system not shown or other suitable control means. As such the positioning of the additive material on the paper web can be controlled relative to the location that the continuous cigarette rod that is manufactured using the second component is cut into predetermined lengths and hence registration of the applied pattern of additive material on a finished cigarette can be achieved. That is the automated cutting knife not shown for subdividing the continuous rod into predetermined lengths can be controlled relative to those components used to apply additive material to the paper web that is used to provide that continuous rod.

The paper web exits the temperature control device and is advanced to the cigarette making machine . Direction of the paper web is provided by suitably aligned series of idler rollers or guideposts turning bars or other suitable means for directing the paper web from the first component to the second component . Suitable pathways for travel of the paper web can be provided by suitably designed tracks or tunnels not shown . As such there is provided a way to direct the paper web from the first component to the second component .

The continuous paper web is received from the first component by the second component . Typically the paper web is directed from idler roller to roller of the cigarette making machine or other suitable location. The paper web travels through printing assembly where indicia can be printed on the outer surface of that web if desired. The paper web then travels to the garniture region of the cigarette making machine where there are provided components for manufacturing a continuous cigarette rod by wrapping the tobacco filler in the paper web. The garniture conveyor belt advances that paper web through that garniture region. At the left end of the suction conveyor system tobacco filler is deposited from its source on the foraminous belt onto the paper web . The garniture region includes finger rail assembly garniture entrance cone scrape tongue folding mechanism and adhesive applicator that are employed to provide a continuous cigarette rod . The continuous rod is subdivided into a plurality of rods not shown each of the desired length using known techniques and equipment not shown . Those rods then most preferably have filter elements attached thereto using known techniques and equipment not shown .

Referring to there is shown a two component automated cigarette making machine assembly that is constructed by coupling a wrapping material supply machine e.g. a first component with a cigarette making machine e.g. a second component . The assembly incorporates those general components that operate in the overall general manner that have been described previously with reference to .

The supply machine most preferably is a free standing machine that is capable of providing a patterned web of wrapping material to a conventional or suitably modified cigarette making machine . The supply machine includes a frame that supports at least one unwind spindle assembly onto which a first bobbin is mounted. The paper web is threaded through a tension sensor which in conjunction with a braking component connected to the shaft of the unwind spindle assembly maintains a desired amount of tension on the paper web as it is transferred from the bobbin .

In operation a continuous paper web supplied from a bobbin is routed through a path defined by a series of idler rollers and guideposts . Optionally though not preferably the paper web can be routed through a heating cooling control unit not shown as the paper web passes through the series of rollers and guide posts. The paper web then is routed through an additive applicator system . The additive material most preferably also is applied to predetermined locations on the inside surface of the paper web .

A representative additive applicator system comprises at least one non contact application device . That is for a non contact device the components used to apply additive material to the paper web do not come into direct physical contact with the paper web. The design and arrangement of the non contact application device can vary. For the embodiment shown the applicator system comprises a series of non contact applicators and in particular a plurality of non contact printheads. The additive material typically is provided from a supply source reservoir not shown through tubing e.g. Tygon type tubing or other suitable supply means not shown to a port or supply region infeed regions of those applicators. Each additive applicator of the applicator system can be of a type that applies additive material that has a finely divided solid powder form e.g. an electrostatic deposition type of printing device or that has a fluid form e.g. an ink jet type of printing device . Most preferably the use of such types of techniques to apply coating formulation to a substrate can be computer controlled.

Representative additive applicators can incorporate those various types of technologies contained in the non contact printing systems and associated printing system components available from sources such as Canon Kabushiki Kaisha Durst Phototechnik AG Inca Digital Printers Gradco Japan Ltd. Leggett Platt Digital Technologies Mimaki Engineering Co. Ltd. Olec Corporation Tampoprint AG Vutek Inc. ZUND Spectra Inc. Xaar Xerox Corporation Brother Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha Hitachi Ltd. Toshiba Tec Corporation Hewlett Packard Company Hitachi Koki Imaging Solutions Inc. and Ink Jet Technology Inc.

Electrostatic deposition printing is a non impact method of printing that uses dry coating formulation static electricity and heat to maintain components of that coating formulation in contact with the substrate. That is extremely small sized particles e.g. sub micron size particles incorporating polymeric material e.g. meltable or thermoplastic materials are applied to a substrate. Heat is provided to the coated substrate such as through appropriate exposure to radiation from quartz tube lamps not shown or by suitable contact with heated rollers not shown . As such the plastic materials of the coating formulation that are exposed to heat melt and hence stick e.g. fuse or otherwise become fixed to substrate.

Representative types of electrostatic precipitation techniques and equipment components are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6 501 925 to Yamamoto et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 519 421 to Inoue and US Patent Application 2002 0150829 to Zhao et al. which are incorporated herein by reference.

Ink jet printing is a non impact method of printing that involves ejecting a coating formulation from a nozzle onto a substrate in response to an electronic digital signal. The actual coating formulation ejection method can occur via several processes and can involve the use of pressurized nozzles electrostatic fields piezoelectric elements within nozzles and heaters for vapor phase bubble formation. Various printing methods are described in Durbeck and Sherr eds. Chapter 13 1988 and 2nd Ed. Diamond and Weiss eds. Chapter 14 2002 which are incorporated herein by reference.

Representative types of ink jet printing equipment components methodologies and associated technologies are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4 251 824 to Hara et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 410 899 to Haruta et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 412 224 to Sugitani U.S. Pat. No. 4 463 359 to Ayata et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 532 530 to Hawkins U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 777 to Hawkins et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 281 261 to Lin U.S. Pat. No. 5 563 644 to Isganitis et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 764 257 to Miyazawa et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 181 439 to Bronstein et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 298 780 to Ben Horin et al. and US Patent Application 2003 0067527 to Temple and European Patent Specification 1 003 643 which are incorporated herein by reference.

Typical printheads incorporate a plurality of ejectors or tiny nozzles. For example a typical printhead can incorporate about 300 to about 600 nozzles. Such printheads are capable of applying a series of tiny dots of coating formulation at desired locations on a substrate such as a continuous paper web. Although the sizes of the individual dots can vary typically such dots have diameters in the range of about 50 to about 60 microns. The number of dots applied to a unit area of substrate e.g. the resolution of the application can vary and a representative application can be provided at about 1440 by about 720 dots per square inch dpi . For example for a printing pattern having a resolution of about 600 dpi a printed band having a width of about 24 mm and a length of about 4.2 mm possesses about 100 printed dots.

The number of printheads can vary. The number of printheads and associated nozzles that are employed depends upon factors such as the width of the paper web the speed at which the paper web moves the overall size of each desired pattern the design and positioning of the printed pattern relative on the paper web the number of dots in each pattern the sizes and weights of the dots in each pattern and the speed at which coating formulation can be successively ejected from each nozzle. There can be at least 1 at least 5 at least 10 at least 20 even at least 30 printheads. The upper limit of the number of printheads can be determined by the size and operation of those printheads.

If desired the various heads can be positioned and directed to deposit further amounts of coating formulation on or over coating formulation that previously has been applied to the paper web. That is further amounts of coating formulation can be superimposed over previously deposited amounts of coating formulation. Such further amounts of coating formulation can be identical in composition to or different from that of the coating formulation that previously has been applied to the paper web. As such layered patterns of the general types set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 303 648 filed Nov. 25 2002 can be provided.

The various printheads and associated nozzles can be arranged in a variety of ways. An array of ejectors can be formed by butting together several printheads forming a printhead frame or bar. The printheads can be arranged on the frame so as to remain stationary on that frame or the printheads can be movable on a track. Such a frame can be designed so as to be movable or the frame can be designed so as to remain stationary. Movable printheads can be designed so as to move in a numerous directions for example back and forth perpendicular to parallel to or diagonally relative to the longitudinal axis of the paper web. The various printheads can be positioned side by side e.g. transversely relative to the path of the moving paper web and the various printheads can be positioned in a length wise fashion along the relevant portion of the supply machine e.g. longitudinally relative to the path of the moving paper web .

The manner by which the desired pattern is printed can vary. For recurring bands of about 10 mm width and 24.5 mm length on a 27 mm wide strip of continuous paper web which bands are positioned transversely to the longitudinal axis of the paper web and which bands are spaced about 20 to about 60 mm apart various portions of each band can be produced from the application resulting from a combination of a series of printed segments provided from the nozzles of the various printheads.

For a very rapidly moving paper web portions of a printed pattern can be provided by individual printheads and associated nozzles of a series of printheads that cooperate to provide the desired overall pattern. An example of a manner or method by which a series of printheads can be used to produce various portions of the pattern on a fast moving continuous paper web is as follows. A first series of printheads and nozzles can combine to provide a first portion of a band of a series of spaced bands a second series of printheads and nozzles combine to provide a second portion of that band of that series of bands a third series of heads and nozzles combine to provide a third portion of a band of that series of bands and a fourth series of heads and nozzles combine to provide a fourth portion of a band of that series of bands. That is deposition of coating material as sub patterns from individual heads and nozzles can be programmed to the speed of travel of the continuous paper web as well as to the relative sizes and spacings of the various bands.

An example of a manner or method by which a series of printheads and nozzles can be used to produce repeating series of patterns on a fast moving continuous paper web is as follows. A first series of printheads and nozzles can combine to provide a first band of a first series of spaced bands a second series of printheads and nozzles combine to provide a second band of that first series of bands a third series of printheads and nozzles combine to provide a third band of that first series of bands and a fourth series of printheads and nozzles combine to provide a fourth band of that first series of bands. Then the first series of printheads and nozzles can combine to provide a first band of a second series of spaced bands the second series of printheads and nozzles combine to provide a second band of that second series of bands the third series of printheads and nozzles combine to provide a third band of that second series of bands and the fourth series of heads and nozzles combine to provide a fourth band of that second series of bands. Controlled timing of the speed of the paper web and the application of coating formulation provided by each nozzle results in application of coating formulation at the desired locations on the paper web. As such the printed pattern is continuously repeated in order to provide a continuous paper web printed with a virtually endless pattern of essentially identical bands equally spaced along the length of that paper web.

In order to ensure proper positioning of the coating formulation on the paper web it is desirable to ensure that the nozzles operate very quickly to provide coating formulation e.g. it is highly desirable for the response times of those nozzles to be very short and for those nozzles to turn on and off very quickly . For a fast moving paper web e.g. a paper web traveling at a speed of about 500 meters per minute a non contact applicator that operates relatively slowly can result in application of coating formulation that is streaked across that paper web i.e. undesirable streaking occurs when the positioning and speed of operation of the nozzles are relatively slow as compared to the speed of travel of the paper web .

After the additive material has been applied to the paper web components of the additive material is fixed to maintain components of that material to the paper web. Treatments such as exposure to radiation for curing or heating cooling steps are used to ensure that components of the additive material form a film on the desired regions of the paper web. Prior to or after such types of treatments the paper web can be exposed to a sensor or detector for a registration system and or an inspection system not shown . Preferably the detector is positioned so as to receive information concerning the paper web immediately after additive material has been applied to that paper web. Typically the detector is used in conjunction with the certain registration systems and inspection systems and in conjunction with suitable marker components that are incorporated as components of the additive material . Representative types of sensors detectors and inspection system components and description of inspection system technologies and operation thereof have been set forth hereinbefore with reference to .

For additive materials that have been electrostatically deposited on the paper web the paper web typically is heated and cooled. The paper web can be passed through a heating cooling control device or other suitable means for controlling heat to which the paper web is subjected. The control device can be used to alter the heat to which the paper web and additive material is subjected e.g. by raising or lowering the temperature . For example the control device can be a heating device adapted to soften the additive material that has been applied to the paper web followed by a cooling device to harden the softened additive material. Alternatively for example the heating cooling control device can be a cooling device adapted to assist in the hardening melted additive material that has been applied to the paper web using a heated additive applicator system . Typically the heating cooling control device has a tunnel type configuration through which the paper web is passed through an inlet end and out an outlet end and during the time that the paper web is present within that tunnel region the paper web is subjected to heating supplied using infrared convection a series of heated rollers or radiant heating devices or cooling supplied using refrigerant type liquid carbon dioxide type or liquid nitrogen type cooling devices.

The size of the heating cooling device can vary particularly because that device is positioned and supported by a component that is physically separated from and spaced from the cigarette making machine . That is there is provided sufficient room to subject the paper web to treatment using the heating cooling device . Exemplary heating cooling devices have lengths of about 2 feet to about 10 feet with lengths of about 3 feet to about 8 feet being typical and about 4 feet to about 7 feet being desirable. The distance that the paper web travels through the heating cooling device i.e. the length of travel through that device can vary. For example the paper web can be routed back and forth within the heating cooling device using a suitably adapted roller system configuration not shown . The components of suitable and appropriate heating cooling devices will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of the design manufacture and use of electrostatic deposition printing devices.

For additive materials incorporating pre polymer components that have been applied to the paper web those pre polymer components are cured. For example for additive materials that have been printed onto paper webs using ink jet application devices the paper webs are subjected to exposure to suitable radiation. The paper web can be passed through a suitably modified heating cooling control device in order that radiation curable components of the coating formulation is exposed to a sufficient amount of the appropriate radiation so as to solidify the pre polymer components of that coating formulation. Exemplary types of radiation for curing radiation curable formulations are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 679 115 to Fritzsche et al. and US Stat. Inv. Reg. H1517 to Erickson et al. which is incorporated herein by reference. Radiation curable systems do not necessarily require heating or cooling of components of the coating formulation or the paper web prior to application of the coating formulation to the paper web or heating or cooling of the treated paper web after the additive materials have been applied and fixed thereto.

One type of radiation is electron beam radiation. Such radiation is an ionizing radiation and as such free radical polymerizable compositions within coating formulations can be solidified using electron beam radiation i.e. gamma radiation . Representative types of electron beam radiation curing systems are set forth in US Patent Application 2002 0135290 to Avnery which is incorporated herein by reference. Electron beam curing can be carried out using the technologies that are employed in the types of curing systems available as EZCure Electron Beam Systems from Energy Sciences Inc.

One type of radiation is ultraviolet uv radiation. Such radiation is ionizing radiation and as such free radical polymerizable compositions within coating formulations that also can incorporate suitable free radical initiation systems or photoinitiators can be solidified using uv radiation. Sources of radiation are mercury lamps xenon lamps and those types of sources set forth in US Patent Application 2003 0035037 to Mills et al. which is incorporated herein by reference.

If desired so called hybrid types of curing systems can be employed. For example relevant components of coating formulations can be cured using both uv and electron beam forms of radiation.

The amount of ionizing radiation required to effectively cure the relevant components of the coating formulations can vary. Typically the amount of radiation is in the range of about 5 to about 50 kGray. The radiation is of an intensity and the relevant components are exposed to that radiation for a period of time in order that the relevant components of the coating formulation is exposed to a sufficient amount of radiant energy to provide for the desired degree of polymerization. The selection of appropriate sources of ionizing radiation can be determined by experimentation and the identity and operation of suitable sources of ionizing radiation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of design manufacture and use of devices for curing radiation curable compositions.

The paper web exits the temperature control device and is advanced to the cigarette making machine . Direction of the paper web is provided by suitably aligned series of idler rollers or guideposts turning bars or other suitable means for directing the paper web from the first component to the second component . Suitable pathways for travel of the paper web can be provided by suitably designed tracks or tunnels not shown . As such there is provided a way to direct the paper web from the first component to the second component .

The continuous paper web is received from the first component by the second component . Typically the paper web is directed from idler roller to roller of the cigarette making machine or other suitable location. The paper web travels through printing assembly where indicia can be printed on the outer surface of that web if desired. The paper web then travels to the garniture region of the cigarette making machine where there are provided components for manufacturing a continuous cigarette rod by wrapping the tobacco filler in the paper web. The garniture conveyor belt advances that paper web through that garniture region. The resulting continuous rod is subdivided into a plurality of rods not shown each of the desired length using known techniques and equipment not shown . Those rods then most preferably have filter elements attached thereto using known techniques and equipment not shown .

The cigarette making machine assemblies and configurations described with reference to are representative of cigarette making machine assemblies and configurations that can be used to provide tobacco filler to a garniture region from one location and the patterned paper web to the garniture region from another location. Furthermore the representative cigarette making machine assembly i.e. with the component that provides the patterned paper web positioned to the front and to the right of the component that incorporates the tobacco source and the garniture assembly is such that the general direction of travel of the paper web through the wrapping material supply machine is essentially parallel to the direction of travel of the paper web through the garniture region of the cigarette making machine. However the positioning of the wrapping material supply machine to the cigarette making machine can vary. For example the wrapping material supply machines can be positioned beside or behind the cigarette making machine or positioned generally perpendicular to the garniture region of the cigarette making machine . In such circumstances the path of travel of the paper web from the wrapping material supply machine to the cigarette making machine can be accomplished through the use of appropriately positioned idler bars and roller guides. The exact path of travel of the paper web is a matter of design choice and the selection thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of design and operation of cigarette manufacturing equipment.

Referring to there is shown a three component automated cigarette making machine assembly that is constructed by coupling a wrapping material supply machine possessing a non contact printing electrostatic deposition or ink jet printing component e.g. a first component with a cigarette making machine e.g. a second component . A roll application machine e.g. a third component is positioned between the first and second components. The assembly incorporates those general components that operate in the overall general manner that have been described previously with reference to . That is the assembly includes a cigarette making machine that is described generally with reference to and a wrapping material supply machine that is described generally with reference to . The roll application machine component of the assembly provides a system for applying a coating formulation to the paper web that has had additive material applied thereto using supply machine .

A continuous paper web is provided from a bobbin from the unwind spindle assembly of the supply machine . That paper web is routed through a path defined by idler rollers and guideposts . The supply machine is adapted to incorporate an additive application apparatus in order that a coating formulation of additive material can be applied at desired locations to the inner surface of the paper web . A series of non contact applicators apply additive material to the paper web. A detection device is used to locate and record the location of the additive material that has been applied to the paper web. The paper web and additive material that has been applied thereto then is passed through a heating cooling or source of radiation device in order to provide treatment sufficient to fix the additive material to the paper web.

The paper web is routed through a series of guide posts and rollers in order to be appropriately routed through the third component of the cigarette making machine assembly . The third component possesses a frame and a roll application unit for applying a second coating formulation to the paper web . A representative roll application unit possesses pick up roller and applicator roller . A detection device is used to locate and record the location of the second additive material and optionally also the first additive material that has been applied to the paper web. The paper web having two types of additive material applied thereto then is routed through a heating cooling device such as is described previously with reference to . The paper web then exits the heating cooling device at outlet end and travels on to the second component of the three component arrangement .

Tobacco filler and components for manufacturing a continuous cigarette rod from the tobacco filler is carried out using the second component of that system . The paper web is routed from the third unit to the second unit using a series of rollers and guide bars and to the garniture region of the second component . The garniture conveyor belt is used to transport that paper web through the garniture region of the cigarette making machine . The paper web also can travel through printing assembly where indicia can be printed on the outer surface of that web if desired.

For preferred three component systems the three components are independent stand alone units. The third component of the system is positioned between the first component and second component and is used to apply coating formulation to the paper web that is supplied by the first component. The third component of the system also is adapted so that the continuous paper web passes from that third component to the second component of the system for cigarette manufacture. As such coating formulation from a second application system can be applied to a paper web over the coating formulation previously applied to that paper web by a first application system. For example a coating formulation that is virtually absent of solvent can be applied to the paper web and the pre polymer components of that formulation can be cured to provide a first coating layer and then a water based starch containing coating formulation can be applied as a second layer over the first layer. As such superimposed layers of coating material can be applied to a paper web such as is set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 303 648 filed Nov. 25 2002.

For the cigarette making machine assemblies described with reference to registration of the transversely positioned bands of additive material on a continuous paper web so as to be within a tolerance window is a very desirable feature when those bands are used for the production of cigarettes that meet certain standards with regards to low ignition propensity criteria. Registration of the patterns e.g. bands applied to continuous paper webs within a tolerance window can be carried out whether the patterns are applied off line e.g. as pre printed patterns or on line e.g. as patterns applied on the cigarette making apparatus . In particular a 2 axes control system i.e. a system that controls two independent motors is used within the cigarette making apparatus in conjunction with a high speed band sensor i.e. which is fast enough to respond to nominal cigarette making speeds . A first servo motor drives the flying knife of the cigarette making machine. The knife position at rod cut off location is derived by an encoder mechanically coupled to the cut off knife and this signal is used as a reference point for determining the position of the band. A second servo motor drives the garniture belt and the foraminous conveyor belt and a second encoder provides the feedback regarding cigarette making speed. The detector senses a band and the location of that band with respect to the cutoff knife. If the bands are out of registration on the cigarette rods the servo control system typically slows down the garniture belt relative to the cut off knife so that the knife temporally will cut shorter rods until the continuous tobacco rod is in registration. This can be achieved either by speeding up the cut off knife or slowing down the garniture belt. For example the system can be programmed to make a small adjustment per rod e.g. such as 1 mm per cut change per rod so as to walk the system into to registration as smoothly as possible. However for smaller adjustments longer periods are required to bring the cigarette rods back within the tolerance window and hence more short cigarettes will be rejected. Such a registration system is particularly useful for making adjustments i during cigarette making machine start up ii during machine operation after recovery from a shutdown or after a new bobbin of paper web is spliced into the machine iii during normal cigarette making machine operation due to factors such as stretching of the paper web.

Referring to there is shown a portion of a cigarette making machine assembly that includes an additive applicator apparatus that uses rollers to apply additive material not shown directly to the surface of a continuous strip of paper web . Such an additive applicator is particularly useful for applying to a paper web additive materials that are liquid or liquid dispersions that are not particularly viscous e.g. formulations of additive materials having viscosities of less than about 1 000 centipoise .

Additive applicator is an assembly that includes a pick up roller and a transfer roller mounted adjacent to each other and through a first or front roller support plate on the exterior front face of the cigarette making machine assembly . A second or rear roller support plate located in the plane of and adjacent to the front roller plate provides a surface to which other structures of the additive applicator are mounted. Components of the additive applicator apparatus including rollers and support plates are manufactured from materials such as stainless steel or hardened carbon steel. Several rotatable guide rollers are suitably fixedly mounted such as to either the front roller plate or rear roller plate depending upon the desired location of those guide rollers. Those guide rollers provide the path over which the paper web travels from a bobbin not shown past the additive applicator and on to other downstream destinations of the cigarette making machine assembly.

The additive applicator also includes a manifold positioned above an additive material reservoir which is defined by the positioning of a reservoir front arm and a reservoir rear arm . Those arms are positioned above the pick up roller . Tubing or other suitable supply means is connected to the manifold and originates at a source of additive material not shown to provide an input of additive material to reservoir and hence to the roll face of the pick up roller . That portion of the additive applicator assembly thus provides a sealed path for flow of additive material to the region where that additive material is deposited onto the pick up roller. Preferably the reservoir front arm and rear arm each include at least one port not shown located on the bottom sides of each of those arms . At least one of those ports is an output port through which additive material is supplied to the roll face of the pick up roller . At least one other port is an input port through which a suction pump not shown suctions excess additive material from the edges of the pick up roller and pumps excess additive material back into the reservoir defined by arms . The assembly also includes a collection pot positioned adjacent to and slightly below the pick up roller . The collection pot serves as a temporary collection location for excess additive material removed from the pick up roller .

The manifold is attached to a glue manifold pivot plate which is attached to the front roller plate and the rear roller plate . Such attachment leaves the manifold with the capability of moving upward and downward about a manifold pivot pin not shown . Movement of the manifold upward from the operative position allows access to those regions located below the manifold. Access to that region is desirable have access to the reservoir arms to insert remove and service the pick up roller and for maintenance and service of the collection pot . In addition the reservoir arms are movable upward and downward about a reservoir pivot shaft not shown to allow access to the pick up roller and the collection pot .

The transfer roller and the pick up roller are positioned into operative engagement with one another using a roller pressure plate . The roller pressure plate is operably connected to an air cylinder or other suitable means for applying force to rollers . The air cylinder utilizes compressed air to force the roller pressure plate about a pressure plate pivot shaft into and out of engagement with the transfer roller . Movement of the roller pressure plate to engage and disengage the pick up roller with the transfer roller can programmed and as such a microprocessor associated with the operation of the cigarette making machine can be used to control movement of that plate .

The additive applicator further comprises a roller lift bracket mounted to the front roller plate and that lift bracket is movable. The roller lift bracket includes a pair of rollers or other suitable means for controlling the path of travel of the paper web . The roller lift bracket is operably connected to an air cylinder or other suitable means for applying force to the lift bracket. The air cylinder also is connected to a supply of pressurized air by an air tube or other suitable connection and supply means. The air cylinder utilizes compressed air to move the pair of rollers on the roller lift bracket into and out of rotating contact with the advancing paper web . For example when the rollers on the roller lift bracket move downward into contact with the paper web that paper web is likewise moved into rotating contact with roll face of the transfer roller . As a result of the contact of the paper web with the transfer roller the additive material applied to the transfer roller is transferred to the inside surface of the paper web in a desired pattern or fashion. Movement of the roller lift bracket and rollers into and out of contact with the paper web can programmed and as such a microprocessor associated with the operation of the cigarette making machine can be used to control movement of that bracket . The roller lift bracket can be controlled by a signal received from the cigarette making machine in order that the bracket can be retracted and the paper web can be moved so as to not be in contact with the various rollers when the cigarette making machine is not in normal operation and as such problems associated with sticking of the paper web to various components of the applicator apparatus are minimized avoided or prevented.

In operation during the process of cigarette manufacture the pick up roller is rotated counter clockwise and the transfer roller is rotated clock wise. Those rollers are engaged in contact by pressure supplied by the pressure plate . Additive material is feed from a source not shown to the manifold and from the manifold to the reservoir from the reservoir to the roll face of the pick up roller and onto the transfer roller . The additive material then is transferred from the transfer roller to the paper web as the paper web advances across the surface of the rotating transfer roller . That is as the paper web advances across the surface of the rotating transfer roller the roller lift bracket is moved downward and the rollers attached to that roller lift bracket are moved into contact with the advancing paper web . As a result the additive material on the surface of the transfer roller is transferred to the inside surface of the advancing paper web at locations corresponding to the pattern on the roller face of the transfer roller . The paper web having additive material applied thereto then is advanced to downstream locations of the cigarette making machine.

Referring to there is shown a portion of a representative additive applicator apparatus . The pick up roller and the transfer roller are shown roll contact with one another and in operative engagement. Pick up roller possesses a roll face having a pattern of recessed grooves having the form of spaced bands or other desired pattern. Those recessed grooves provide a location for a predetermined amount of additive material to be deposited and the size and shape of those grooves is a matter of design choice. The pick up roller is rotated using a pick up drive shaft shown as cut away and the transfer roller is rotated using an applicator drive shaft shown as extending from opening in the applicator drive shaft box . The drive shafts extend through an opening in the front roller support plate which is adjacent the rear roller support plate . The pick up roller and the transfer roller are adapted to extend beyond the front faces of each of the front and rear roller plates .

The applicator drive shaft box is adapted to be positioned and secured to the back side of the front and rear roller plates . A pick up roller gear is in operative connection with the pick up drive shaft . A transfer roller gear is in operative connection with the applicator drive shaft . Both gears are located external to the applicator drive shaft box and are positioned on the back side of that drive shaft box . Those gears have interlocking teeth such that rotation of one of those gears in one direction causes rotation of the other gear in the opposite direction. The transfer roller gear is connected to a transfer roller pulley . A belt extends about the transfer roller pulley and around a power source pulley not shown . As a result power for rotational movement is provided to the transfer roller shaft and transfer roller by rotation of the pulley by movement of the belt and power for controlled rotational movement is provided to the pick up roller by way of the drive shaft that is rotated by operation of gears . In addition belt can act as a timing belt and by suitable use of that belt to control the speed of the applicator drive shaft relative to the speed of operation of the cigarette making machine it is possible to provide integral timing with the cigarette rod subdivision mechanism not shown of the cigarette making machine. Thus appropriate use of belt to connect appropriate gear mechanisms yields a method for providing pattern e.g. band registration for each individual finished cigarette rods not shown that are cut from the continuous rod not shown .

The applicator assembly can further include a photoelectric sensor switch not shown located above a point of roller engagement between the pick up roller and the transfer roller . An exemplary sensor is a WT 12 2P430 from Sick Inc. Output from the photoelectric proximity switch is sent to a PLC or other suitable processor not shown associated with that photoelectric sensor not shown and monitors the amount e.g. level of additive material not shown in the region above that point of roller engagement of rollers . Thus as a flow of additive material is supplied from the manifold not shown and reservoir not shown an amount of the additive material forms at the point of engagement between those rollers . When the amount of that additive material supplied to that region drops below a predetermined level for sufficient desired transfer of the additive material to the transfer roller the information sensed and supplied by photoelectric sensor controls a switch to activate a pump not shown and hence to supply more additive material to the reservoir. Similarly deactivation of the pump can be controlled when a desired level of additive material is achieved.

The applicator assembly can further include sensors not shown that assist in ensuring that proper amounts of additive material is transferred to the paper web. For example an induction type sensor not shown located in the region of a pick up roller can sense that the pick up roller and other associated components of the applicator assembly are in proper position. In addition the cigarette making machine can be programmed such that when the induction sensor detects that the pick up roller is not in proper position that machine can provide appropriate signal to the operator or cease operation. In addition a further sensor not shown can be mounted on the rear roller plate at a location of the paper web after that paper web has passed over the transfer roller . That further sensor can be used to detect the presence or degree of presence of additive material on the paper web . Detection of a sufficient presence of additive material on the paper web indicates that additive material transfer mechanisms are operating properly. The cigarette making machine can be programmed to alert the machine operator or stop movement of the paper web if the further sensor detects an insufficient presence of the additive material on the paper web .

Referring to there is shown a portion of a cigarette making machine assembly and there also are shown relevant components of another representative additive applicator apparatus . Such an applicator is particularly useful for applying to a paper web more viscous additive materials than those embodiments described previously with reference to . More viscous additive materials useful in applications involving cigarette paper include for example formulations of additive materials having viscosities of greater than 100 000 centipoise. Such higher viscosity additive materials can be characterized as pastes.

Additive applicator is an assembly that includes a major pick up transfer roller and a transfer pressure roller or back up roller mounted adjacent to each other and through a front roller plate secured to front exterior of a cigarette making machine. Each of a plurality of rollers is fixedly mounted to the front roller plate and those rollers provide guides for a path over which the paper web travels from a bobbin not shown to the additive applicator and on to other regions of the cigarette making machine .

Positioned adjacent to the major roller is a reservoir for the additive material. The reservoir is maintained in place and secured to the front roller plate by bolts not shown or other suitable connection means. The reservoir is connected to a source not shown of additive material e.g. a formulation having the form of a paste through port near the top region of the reservoir . As such a source of additive material for the major roller is provided. Typically the additive material is supplied through tubing not shown such as Tygon type tubing that feeds the reservoir through port . The additive applicator provides a sealed path for flow of the additive material to the point of deposit onto the major roller . The reservoir includes at least two ports not shown on the side thereof adjacent to the major roller . One port is an output port positioned near the middle of the reservoir through which additive material is supplied to the major roller . At least one other port is an input port through which excess additive material is scraped from the edges of the major roller and is fed back into the reservoir .

The reservoir is attached to an assembly that is designed to exert pressure upon that reservoir. Such a pressure exerting assembly includes a reservoir pad that is positioned adjacent to the reservoir . The reservoir pad is held in position by a reservoir pad retainer which encompasses the reservoir pad . Compression springs are positioned between the reservoir pad retainer and a reservoir spring retainer and provide resistance for tightening of the reservoir spring retainer toward the reservoir . Screws or other suitable connection means are positioned through each side of the reservoir spring retainer through the center of each respective compression spring and through a passage in each side of the reservoir pad retainer . The screws are movable in and out of respective passages of the reservoir pad retainer . The threaded ends of the screws are positioned in threaded contact with threaded walls of the passages of the reservoir pad so as to supply the application of pressure to the reservoir pad when pressure is exerted against the reservoir spring retainer .

An adjustment screw mounting plate is attached to the front roller plate adjacent to the reservoir spring retainer . An adjustment screw is threaded through the adjustment screw mounting plate into contact with the reservoir spring retainer . When the adjustment screw is adjusted a predetermined amount inward into increasingly compressive contact with reservoir spring retainer pressure is applied by the screws to the reservoir pad . As a result a predetermined amount of pressure is exerted on the paste reservoir . The additive material formulation is caused to flow to the reservoir by application of head pressure supplied from an upstream pumping system not shown or other suitable means. The additive applicator also can be equipped with sensors and control devices not shown of the type described previously with reference to .

A scraper plate is connected to the reservoir . A compression spring is positioned between a scraper and the scraper plate such that the scraper is urged into operative contact with the roll face of the major roller . As such excess additive material on the surface of the roll face of the major roller is scraped from that roll face as the moving major roller passes the scraper and that material is deposited back into the reservoir . Thus additive material carried by the major roller for transfer to the paper web is located in the desired location within the pockets located on the roll face of that roller.

Rollers together with transfer pressure roller are positioned on a roller lift bracket . The roller lift bracket is designed to be moved downward by the forces applied by air cylinder about a lift bracket pivot plate . The air cylinder is connected to a source of pressurized air not shown and is employed to provide for movement of the roller lift bracket . The roller lift bracket is attached on one end to the front roller plate about lift bracket pivot plate through roller lift bracket pivot pin and the lift bracket is movable. The roller lift bracket further includes a lift bracket pivot sleeve which is slidingly attached on the end opposite the pivot pin to lift bracket pivot plate .

In operation the transfer pressure roller and rollers can be moved about the pivot pin so as to be positioned into and out of contact with the upper surface of the paper web . When the transfer pressure roller is moved into operative contact with the major roller the transfer pressure roller rotates under the power of the major roller but in the opposite direction to that of the major roller. Preferably the major roller rotates clockwise and the transfer pressure roller rotates counter clockwise. The transfer pressure roller thus preferably contacts the advancing paper web at a point of engagement of the roll faces of the transfer pressure roller and the major roller . As a result of the pressured contact experienced by the paper web as it travels between transfer pressure roller and the major roller additive material is applied to the paper web in a predetermined pattern. Movement of the roller lift bracket transfer pressure roller and rollers into and out of contact with the paper web can programmed and as such a microprocessor associated with the operation of the cigarette making machine can be used to control movement of that lift bracket . The roller lift bracket can be controlled by a signal received from the cigarette making machine in order that the bracket can be retracted and the paper web can be moved so as to not be in contact with the various rollers when the cigarette making machine is not in normal operation and as such problems associated with sticking of the paper web to various components of the applicator apparatus are minimized avoided or prevented.

Referring to there are shown relevant components of a portion of a representative additive applicator apparatus . The major roller possesses a roll face having a pattern of recessed grooves or pockets thus providing a pocketed wheel. The diameter of the major roller can vary but suitable major roller has a diameter of about 104 mm. Exemplary grooves provide spaced bands located so as to extend perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of a paper web and across a portion of the width of that paper web and are generally box like in shape. The dimensions of the grooves can vary and are dependent upon factors such as the pattern of application that is desired but suitable grooves have depths of about 2 mils longitudinally extending lengths of about 5 mm and transversely extending lengths of about 23 mm. Those grooves are designed to contain additive material not shown and to transfer that additive material to a paper web not shown that contacts that roller face as the paper web travels past the roll face of the major roller . As such for the pattern shown spaced apart bands are applied at predetermined intervals transversely to the longitudinal axis of the continuous paper web. That is the recessed grooves provide a location for a predetermined amount of additive material to be deposited on a paper web and the size and shape of those grooves is a matter of design choice. The major roller is manufactured from materials such as stainless steel hardened carbon steel or the like.

The roller lift bracket supports rollers and back up roller . Back up roller or soft faced roller typically is manufactured from stainless steel or hardened carbon steel and the roll surface is provided by an overlying band or ring of a suitable material such as a rubber type or elastomeric material. Suitable soft faced rollers are adapted from those types of commonly used for component parts of conventional cigarette making machines and are manufactured from materials commonly used in conventional cigarette making machines. The rubber type material can be manufactured from a suitable polyurethane material. The roller lift bracket also supports the air cylinder and the pivot plate . The diameter of the back up roller can vary but a suitable back up roller has a diameter of about 40 mm.

The reservoir for the additive material is assembled along with the reservoir spring retainer the adjustment screw mounting plate the adjustment screw scraper and the scraper plate .

Positioned on the front roller plate are a plurality of rollers and an opening . The major roller is connected to a roller drive shaft that passes through opening and to an applicator drive shaft box that is in turn connected to a roller gear . A belt extends about the roller gear and around a pulley mounted to a power drive assembly . Rotational power is provided from the power drive assembly to the roller gear to the roller shaft and to the major roller . Timing belt pulley can be used to receive input regarding the speed of operation of the cigarette making machine and hence can be use in conjunction with a belt not shown to time operation of the other components of the applicator apparatus .

Referring to there are shown relevant components of a portion of yet another representative additive applicator apparatus . Other components of the additive applicator apparatus and the general operation thereof are described previously with reference to . Such an applicator is particularly useful for applying to a paper web more viscous additive materials. More viscous additive materials useful in applications involving cigarette paper include for example paste type formulations of additive materials having viscosities of greater than 100 000 centipoise.

Additive applicator is an assembly including a major pick up transfer roller that is generally similar to that pocketed roller described previously with reference to . For example the diameter of the major roller can be about 104 mm and the major roller can be manufactured from materials such as stainless steel hardened carbon steel and the like. Several rollers not shown are fixedly mounted to the front roller plate and those rollers provide guides for a path over which the paper web travels from a bobbin not shown to the additive applicator between the roll faces of major roller and back up roller and on to other regions of the cigarette making machine .

Positioned adjacent to the major roller is a reservoir for the additive material. The reservoir is maintained in place and secured to the front roller plate by bolts not shown or other suitable connection means. The reservoir is connected to a source not shown of additive material e.g. a formulation having the form of a paste through the top region of the reservoir . As such a source of additive material for the major roller is provided. A portion of the reservoir is shown in phantom in order to show more clearly the positioning of a portion of the major roller within the reservoir and to more clearly show the positioning of the scrapers against the roll face and side respectively of the major roller. Typically the additive material is supplied through tubing not shown such as Tygon type tubing that feeds the reservoir through a port not shown . The additive applicator provides a path for flow of the additive material to the point of deposit onto the major roller .

A scraper is connected to the body of the reservoir . The scraper is urged into operative contact with the roll face of the major roller . As such excess additive material on the surface of the roll face of the major roller is scraped from that roll face as the moving major roller passes the scraper and that material is deposited back into the reservoir . Thus additive material carried by the major roller for transfer to the paper web is located in the desired location within the pockets located on the roll face of that roller. Against the front side face of major roller is positioned a scraper . A corresponding scraper not shown is positioned against the back side face of the major roller . As such the roll face and both side faces are subjected to surface treatment by three scraper pieces arranged in a U like configuration so as to remove undesirable excess additive formulation from those surfaces and hence maintain those surfaces relatively clean by maintaining those surfaces relatively free of build up of coating formulation.

Referring to there is shown certain relevant components an additive applicator apparatus representative of one aspect of the present invention. Such an application system is useful for applying additive material not shown to a moving substrate such as a continuously moving strip of paper web not shown . The application system can replace those types of applicators described previously with reference to . That is the applicator system can be positioned in those locations for applicator systems for those cigarette making machines described previously with reference to and .

The applicator system includes an outer housing that has an outer roll face . A representative outer housing has a generally circular shape and the circumference of the roll face is about 40.2 cm. The roll face or application face possesses a several passageways and those passageways extend from the outer surface of the outer housing to within a central cavity or inner region of that outer housing . The shapes dimensions format and locations of the passageways can vary but as shown exemplary passageways each are composed of a series of holes e.g. each passageway is composed of two rows each of about 23 mm across and each row is composed of seven holes each of about 0.75 mm in diameter . Alternatively for example the passageways each can have the form of one continuous passageway e.g. each passageway has the form of a slot having a width of about 23 mm and a length of about 0.25 mm . The six representative passageways are positioned so as to provide for spaced band shaped patterns on a continuous strip of paper web. Exemplary passageways are positioned such that first and second passageways are separated by about 30 mm second and third passageways are separated by about 104 mm third and fourth passageways are separated by about 30 mm fourth and fifth passageways are separated by about 104 mm fifth and sixth passageways are separated by about 30 mm and sixth and first passageways are separated by about 104 mm. As such each revolution of the roll face can provide printing on a continuous paper web so as to provide wrapping material for a six cigarette rods each rod 67 mm in length and each rod having one band printed at about 15 mm from one end thereof. The passageways can be provided by forming or machining the desired passageway configuration through the desired locations of the outer housing or the passageways can be formed or machined into a replaceable inserts that is designed to fit into a corresponding receptacle in the outer surface region of the outer housing. The number and positioning of the passageways can vary depending upon factors such as desired location of application on the wrapping material the size of cigarette rods manufactured using the wrapping material and the circumference of the roll face of the outer housing. Furthermore the exact size shape and format of the individual passageways can vary is dependent upon the desired configuration of pattern to be applied to the wrapping material and is a matter of design choice.

The outer housing possesses an inner gear face . The inner face has a generally circular face and possesses a series of gear teeth . For the exemplary applicator system shown the inner face possesses a series of 54 teeth those teeth being characterized as DIN Module 2. Gear teeth adjacent to one another in the regions of the respective passageways are designed so as to extend essentially across the width of the inner cavity and the front and back regions of the other gear teeth are designed so that those teeth do not extend entirely across the width of the inner cavity. Typically gear teeth having the shape of gear teeth are milled on the front and back regions thereof and the shape of gear teeth milled in such a manner is such that churning or other unnecessary movement of fluid coating formulation within the inner region of the outer housing is minimized during operation of the applicator system. The outer housing also possesses a front plate or face not shown to enclose inner region of that outer housing. Typically the passageways are positioned so as to extend from the outer surface of the outer housing to a trough region between two adjacent gears of the inner surface of that outer housing. Thus when the gears mate as shown that mating occurs near the uppermost region of the applicator system. As such coating formulation not shown can be forced from the trough region between those gears outwards to the outer surface of the outer housing.

Within the outer housing is positioned an inner gear . The inner gear is generally circular in shape and possesses a series of gear teeth . For the exemplary application system shown the inner gear possesses a series of 44 teeth those teeth being characterized as DIN Module 2. The outer housing and the inner gear are positioned such that the gear teeth extending from the inner surface of the outer housing are positioned in a cooperating arrangement with the gear teeth extending from the outer surface of the inner gear. A drive shaft provides suitable means for supplying rotation of the outer housing . That is appropriate connection of one end of the drive shaft to the outer housing and appropriate connection of the other end not shown of the drive shaft to a suitable power source not shown allows power supplied by the power source to provide rotation of the outer housing at the desired rate. Manners and methods for connecting a drive shaft to the power source and other components of a cigarette making machine are set forth previously with reference to .

A fluid coating formulation not shown is introduced into the cavity of the outer housing through entrance port from a source such as a tube not shown and the formulation can be pumped or otherwise supplied from a supply reservoir not shown . In use the outer housing is rotated clockwise by rotation of the drive shaft . The inner gear also is rotated clockwise and as such the inner and outer components also rotate relative to one another. Coating formulation within the reservoir region of the inner cavity is transferred to trough regions between adjacent teeth of the outer gear. That is rotation of the outer gear within the housing and the passage of a portion of the gear face of the inner gear through the reservoir region results in the outward forces that result in introduction of coating formulation to the trough regions between the adjacent teeth of the outer housing. A scrape plough or other suitable means for removing excess coating material from the surface of the teeth of the outer housing is positioned upstream from the pick up region of the reservoir . Typically the scrape is positioned abut 0.5 mm from the upper surface of the gear teeth of the outer housing. The cooperation of the gear teeth of the two gears that rotate relative to one another is such that during mating coating material in the trough regions of adjacent teeth of certain gear teeth of the inner gear with the gear teeth of the outer housing near the upper region of the applicator system forces or pumps the coating formulation not shown through the passageway and to the outer surface of the outer housing .

Referring to there is shown the outer housing having a generally circular outer roll face . The outer housing includes six passageways and the gear teeth located on the inner surface of that outer housing. Within the outer housing is the reservoir region an inlet port for coating formulation not shown the scrape and the mount or support for that scrape. Within the outer housing is the inner gear . The drive shaft provides for rotation of the outer housing.

Referring to there is shown various components of the applicator apparatus . The application system includes a bearing housing for ball bearings an inner bearing spacer an outer bearing spacer and internal retaining ring and an external beveled retaining ring . The system also includes a drive shaft the inner gear and the outer housing . The gear teeth of the inner surface of the outer housing that are shown are those that have been shaped so as to avoid churning of the fluid coating formulation not shown within the reservoir . A rear side plate or disc and a front side plate or disc maintains a closed system. Inlet port to the inner cavity is provided through a passage from a supply port from a source not shown . The applicator system also includes a needle bearing a gear mount for the inner gear thrust washers and a series of nuts screws or other suitable connection means for maintaining the various components in proper operative arrangement. The various components of the applicator system are manufactured from suitable materials such as stainless steel hardened carbon steel or the like. The application system also includes a series of appropriately located seals such as o rings . Appropriate seals can be manufactured from Teflon type materials polyurethane type materials rubber type materials or the like. The construction of the application system most preferably is such that coating formulation only exits that system from desired locations such as the passageways at the appropriate times.

Referring to there is shown certain relevant components of another embodiment of additive applicator apparatus representative of one aspect of the present invention. Such an application system is useful for applying additive material not shown to a moving substrate such as a continuously moving strip of paper web not shown . The application system can replace those types of applicators described previously with reference to . That is the applicator system is similar in many regards to that applicator system set forth previously with reference to and the applicator system can be positioned in those locations for applicator systems for those cigarette making machines described previously with reference to and .

The applicator system includes an outer housing that has an outer roll face . The outer housing has a generally circular shape and the circumference of the roll face for the representative embodiment shown is about 40.2 cm. The roll face or application face possesses a several passageways and those passageways extend from the outer surface of the outer housing to within a central cavity or inner region of that outer housing . The shapes dimensions format and locations of the passageways can vary and representative passageway configurations have been described previously with reference to . A drive shaft provides suitable means for supplying rotation of the inner gear . That is appropriate connection of one end of the drive shaft to the outer housing and appropriate connection of the other end not shown of the drive shaft to a suitable power source not shown allows power supplied by the power source to provide rotation of the outer housing at the desired rate. Manners and methods for connecting a drive shaft to the power source and other components of a cigarette making machine are set forth previously with reference to .

A plough scrape or other suitable means for removing excess coating material from the surface of the teeth of the outer housing is positioned upstream from the pick up region of the reservoir . In operation the cooperation of the gear teeth of the two gears that rotate relative to one another is such that coating material in the trough regions of adjacent teeth of certain gear teeth of the inner gear with the gear teeth of the outer housing near the upper region of the application system forces or pumps the coating formulation not shown through the passageway and to the outer surface of the outer housing .

Referring to there is shown the outer housing that includes six passageways and the gear teeth located on the inner surface of that outer housing. Within the outer housing is the reservoir region an inlet port for coating formulation not shown the plough and the mount or support for that plough. Within the outer housing is the inner gear . The drive shaft provides for rotation of the outer housing.

Referring to there is shown there is shown various components of the applicator apparatus . The application system includes a bearing housing for ball bearings second ball bearings third ball bearings bearing spacer wind back seal internal retaining ring and an external beveled retaining ring . The system also includes a drive shaft the inner gear and the outer housing . The gear teeth of the inner surface of the outer housing that are shown are those that have been shaped so as to avoid churning of the fluid coating formulation not shown within the reservoir . A front side plate or disc maintains a closed system. Inlet port to the inner cavity is provided through a passage from a supply port from a source not shown . The applicator system also includes a needle bearing and a series of nuts screws or other suitable connection means for maintaining the various components in proper operative arrangement. The various components of the applicator system are manufactured from suitable materials such as stainless steel hardened carbon steel or the like. The application system also includes a series of appropriately located seals such as o rings .

For the embodiments shown with reference to the amount of additive material applied to the continuous paper web can be controlled with greater precision by holding the paper web firmly down against the outer housing during rotation of that housing. This can be accomplished for example by use of a flexible moving belt not shown . That is a flexible continuous belt of appropriate width can be positioned so as to form a type of arc that matches the general shape of a portion of the peripheral face of the region of the outer housing where coating formulation is forced from the applicator system. Typically a flexible belt can be applied under tension between two or more guide posts not shown positioned to maintain the belt in place or by other suitable means. As such there is provided an arrangement whereby force is applied generally downwards to the outer surface of the paper web so as to counteract forces e.g. those forces provided by the outward pumping action of the applicator system and centrifugal forces resulting from the high speed rotation of the outer housing that have an undesirable tendency to force the paper web away from the outer housing during operation of the applicator system.

The types of application systems described with reference to can be used to apply coating formulations of the type having a fluid form and exemplary coating formulations that have fluid forms can have the form of liquids syrups pastes emulsions or dispersions or slurries of solid materials within any of the foregoing. Those application systems are particularly useful for applying fluid coating formulations that have a wide range of viscosities but are particular coating formulations having viscosities in the range of about 800 000 centipoise to about 1 000 000 centipoise. The application systems can be used to apply coating formulations that are virtually solvent free. For example a generally liquid type of fluid coating formulation incorporating pre polymer components can be applied to a paper web using such an application system and those components that have been applied at desired locations on the paper web can be cured using suitable radiation curing systems of the type set forth hereinbefore with reference to . The application systems also can be used to apply coating formulations of the type set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 324 837 filed Dec. 20 2002. For example a water based coating formulation can be applied to a paper web using such an application system and the formulation that has been applied at desired locations on the paper web can be dried using the suitable microwave curing systems of the type set forth hereinbefore with reference to and .

Referring to there is shown a portion of a cigarette making machine assembly and there also are shown relevant components of another representative additive applicator apparatus . Such an applicator is particularly useful for applying to a paper web certain types of viscous additive materials. Such additive materials useful in applications involving cigarette paper include for example paste type formulations of additive materials having viscosities in the range of about 500 000 centipoise to about 2 500 000 centipoise.

Additive applicator is an assembly that includes a pick up and a transfer pressure roller or back up roller mounted on each side of an application roller . Those rollers are mounted through a front roller plate secured to the front exterior region of a cigarette making machine. Each of a plurality of rollers is fixedly mounted to the front roller plate and those rollers provide guides for a path over which the paper web travels from a bobbin not shown to the additive applicator and on to other regions of the cigarette making machine .

The pick up roller shown in phantom is positioned within a reservoir for the additive material not shown . The reservoir is maintained in place and secured to the front roller plate by bolts or other suitable connection means. The reservoir is connected to a source not shown of additive material e.g. a formulation having the form of a paste through port near the top region of the reservoir . As such a source of additive material for the pick up roller is provided. If desired the reservoir can be equipped with devices for monitoring the amount of additive material that is present within that reservoir such as are described hereinbefore with reference to . Typically the additive material is supplied through tubing not shown such as Tygon type tubing that feeds the reservoir through port . The reservoir of the additive applicator provides a receptable for the additive material to the point of deposit onto the pick up roller .

A doctor blade is positioned near the pick up roller near the top region of that roller. The doctor blade can be supported in a fixed position relative to the roller or the doctor blade can be adjustable for example by being mounted in so as to be moveable using micrometer . As such the positioning of the doctor blade relative to the roll face of roller can be adjusted. Preferably the doctor blade is positioned in order that additive material that has been applied to the roll face of the pick up roller is provided in the desired amount. Typically the doctor blade is positioned so as to provide a layer of additive material on the roll face of the pick up roller that has the desired thickness both along the length and width of the roll face. Typically the doctor blade is positioned about 0.001 to about 0.002 inch from the surface of the roll face of pick up roller . After the additive material on the roll face of the pick up roller has been provided in the desired amount that additive material is transferred from the pick up roller to the face of appropriate die of applicator roller .

The pick up roller preferably is manufactured from a material that can vary but preferably is manufactured from an elastomeric type material such as a polyurethane rubber type material a natural gum rubber ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber or the like. An exemplary pick up roller has a diameter of about 50 mm to about 100 mm. For the embodiment shown the pick up roller rotates counter clockwise within the reservoir and additive material within the reservoir is deposited on the surface of that roller.

The pick up roller is in roll contact with a plurality of protruding applicator dies of application roller . The application roller dies preferably are of the general dimension of the pattern of additive material that is desired to be applied to the paper web . An exemplary application roller is manufactured from stainless steel elastomeric material or a combination of those materials. For example larger wheel portion of the applicator roller can be manufactured from stainless steel and the protruding dies can be manufactured as replaceable inserts manufactured from relatively soft elastomeric materials. Alternatively the wheel and die component parts of the applicator roller can be manufactured from a hard metal material such as stainless steel. An exemplary applicator roller has a diameter of about 50 mm to about 100 mm and typically about 85 mm and possesses four protruding dies each of about 10 mm to about 15 mm in height about 22 mm to about 25 mm in width and about 5 mm to about 8 mm in circumferential length. Other sizes and shapes of the dies other configurations of the dies on the roller other roller sizes and the composition of components used to manufacture the roller can be a matter of design choice. For the embodiment shown application roller rotates clockwise.

In a preferred embodiment each roller is driven independently. For example one servo drive not shown can control the rotation of transfer roller and a second servo drive not shown can control the applicator roller . Controlling operation of the two rollers with independent servo system allow for independent control of speeds of those two rollers and hence the ability to tightly control the tolerances associated with application of additive material to the paper web using those two rollers. Rollers that are independently adjustable also are preferred in that the degree of touching of the roll faces of the respective rollers during roll contact can be controlled.

In operation the continuous paper web passes between the roll faces of the transfer roller and the application roller . As a result of the such contact the forces experienced by the paper web as it travels between the roll faces of the transfer pressure roller and the applicator roller additive material transferred to the surfaces of the protruding dies from the surface of the applicator roller is applied to the paper web in a predetermined pattern. As such the die faces provide a type of off set printing of additive material to desired locations on the moving paper web. Movement of the transfer pressure roller can programmed and as such a microprocessor associated with the operation of the cigarette making machine. Such control by a signal received from the cigarette making machine can allow for retraction of the pressure roller from the paper web so as to not be in contact with the various rollers when the cigarette making machine is not in normal operation and as such problems associated with sticking of the paper web to various components of the applicator apparatus are minimized avoided or prevented.

Referring to there is shown a portion of a cigarette making machine assembly and there also are shown relevant components of another representative additive applicator apparatus . Such an applicator is particularly useful for applying to a paper web certain types of viscous additive materials. Such additive materials useful in applications involving cigarette paper include for example paste type formulations of additive materials having viscosities in the range of about 500 000 centipoise to about 2 500 000 centipoise.

Each of a plurality of rollers is fixedly mounted to the front roller plate and those rollers provide guides for a path over which the paper web travels from a bobbin not shown to the additive applicator and on to other regions of the cigarette making machine .

The pick up roller shown in phantom is positioned within a reservoir for the additive material not shown . The reservoir is maintained in place and secured to the front roller plate by bolts or other suitable connection means. The reservoir is connected to a source not shown of additive material e.g. a formulation having the form of a paste through port near the top region of the reservoir . As such a source of additive material for the pick up roller is provided. Typically the additive material is supplied through tubing not shown such as Tygon type tubing that feeds the reservoir through port .

A doctor blade is positioned near the pick up roller near the top region of that roller. The doctor blade can be mounted in a fixed position relative to the roll face of the roller. The doctor blade also can be adjustable for example by being positioned so as to be movable using a micrometer . As such the positioning of the doctor blade relative to the roll face of roller can be adjusted. Preferably the doctor blade is positioned in order that additive material that has been applied to the roll face of the pick up roller is provided in the desired amount. Typically the doctor blade is positioned so as to provide a layer of additive material on the roll face of the pick up roller that has the desired thickness both along the length and width of the roll face. Typically the doctor blade is positioned about 0.001 to about 0.002 inch from the surface of the roll face of pick up roller . After the additive material on the roll face of the pick up roller has been provided in the desired amount that additive material is transferred from the pick up roller to the face of appropriate location on the paper web .

The pick up roller preferably is manufactured from a material that can vary can be a soft material or a hard material but preferably is manufactured from an elastomeric type material such as a polyurethane rubber type material or other suitable material. An exemplary pick up roller is described previously with reference to . The pick up roller rotates clockwise for the embodiment shown within the reservoir and additive material within the reservoir is deposited on the surface of the roll face of that roller.

The pick up roller is in roll contact with protruding applicator cams of application roller . The application roller cams are of the general dimension of the pattern of additive material that is desired to be applied to the paper web . An exemplary application roller is described previously with reference to . For the embodiment shown application roller rotates counter clockwise.

In a preferred embodiment each roller is driven independently. For example one servo drive not shown can control the rotation of transfer roller and a second servo drive not shown can control the applicator roller . Controlling operation of the two rollers with independent servo system allow for independent control of speeds of those two rollers and hence the ability to tightly control the tolerances associated with application of additive material to the paper web using those two rollers.

In operation the continuous paper web passes between the roll faces of the pick up roller and the application roller . As a result of the contact experienced by the paper web as it travels between pick up roller and the applicator roller additive material transferred to the surfaces of the protruding cams from the surface of the applicator roller is applied to the paper web in a predetermined pattern. That is the protruding applicator roller cams on the side of paper web opposite the pick up roller and the additive material cause periodic deflection of the paper web toward the pick up roller and as such additive material is transferred from the surface of the pick up roller to the paper web in a controlled manner as a result of the camming action of the applicator roller. The paper web is routed in a manner such that the paper web has a tendency to move upwards and away from the surface of the applicator pick up roller when the various cams are not deflecting that paper web downwards. As a result control of the location of the application of additive material on the paper web can be carried out.

Referring to there are shown relevant components of a portion of yet another representative additive applicator apparatus . Such an applicator can be used to provide coating formulation to the moving paper web partially shown and cut away in a non contact manner. Such an applicator can be used to apply additive formulation that is ejected onto the paper web such as is set forth hereinbefore with reference to . Appropriate cigarette making assemblies not shown can be equipped with one applicator of such a type or two or more applicators of such a type can be employed in series.

The applicator apparatus possesses an outer housing having a generally wheel like shape. The outer housing has a roll face . A plurality of printheads are arranged at pre determined locations on the roll face . Preferred printheads are ink jet types of printheads for example of the type described previously with reference to .

For the embodiment shown the outer housing is adapted to rotate counter clockwise in the direction indicated by arrow . A strip of paper web travels over at least the top surface of the roll face of the housing in the direction indicated by arrow . The desired path of travel of the paper web is dictated by suitably positioned idler rollers or other appropriate means. Alternatively for an embodiment that is not shown the path of travel of the paper web can be underneath of the housing and can be in the same overall direction as arrow and for such an embodiment the housing is rotated in the direction opposite of arrow . Thus for the two embodiments so described additive material can be applied to either side of a continuous strip of paper web.

Most preferably the printheads are recessed slightly from the surface of the outer roll face of the housing in order that the paper web traveling over the roll face does not come into contact with those printheads. As such non contact application of coating formulation not shown to the paper web can be carried out.

The wheel like housing is supported on by a suitable frame such as is provided by front support and back support . Each support is located on either side of the housing. Each support incorporates suitable bearing assemblies not shown or other suitable means for allowing the housing to rotate relative to those supports.

The housing is supplied with additive material not shown from a suitable supply source not shown using a rotary union or other suitable fluid material supply means. Suitable unions are those available as Deublin to Air Hydraulic Unions from Deublin Company. As such additive material is supplied to the inner region of the housing and thereafter the additive material can be supplied to the printheads .

Control of the rotation of the housing and of the operation of the various printheads is provided from a remote location not shown through wire or other appropriate connection means that are in turn connected to a slip ring . Suitable slip rings are those high speed slip rings available from International Instruments Inc. As such during rotation of the housing electronic control of the printheads can be achieved and additive material from the rotary union also can be supplied to the various printheads.

In operation the paper web is advanced over the top region of the applicator roll face . The applicator is rotated and is rotated at a rate such that application of additive material from each individual printhead provides the desired pattern on the paper web in the desired location on that paper web. As such ejection of additive material is applied as both the applicator nozzles and the paper web both are moving at high rate of speed and for the most highly preferred embodiments at essentially identical speeds. Thus non contact ink jet types of technologies can be used to effectively apply ejected additive materials to pre determined locations and in pre determined patterns onto a continuous strip of paper web moving at a very high rate of speed.

The various aspects of the present invention whether employed individually or in some combination offer several advantages and improvements to conventional systems and methods for cigarette manufacture. The present invention allows a cigarette manufacturer to apply predetermined and discrete amounts of an additive material to a continuous advancing strip of a paper web at desired locations on that paper web during the manufacture of a continuous cigarette rod using conventional types of cigarette making equipment and methodologies. Of particular interest are bands of additive material that are positioned perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the paper web and those bands can be positioned so as to extend across less than the total width of that paper web. As such the location of additive material can be controlled so as to not be located in the lap zone of the continuous cigarette rod e.g. where the side seam adhesive is applied . Thus for example a continuous paper web having a width of about 27 mm and used to provide a cigarette rod having a circumference of about 24.5 mm i.e. such that the lap zone has a width of about 2.5 mm can have a band applied to that web such that the band is not located within the lap zone where side seam adhesive is applied and as such such a band can have a transversely extending length of about 22 mm to about 24.5 mm. The present invention allows a cigarette manufacturer to apply to paper webs additive formulations that have a wide range of chemical and physical properties and that are provided for application in a wide variety of forms e.g. a wide range of viscosities . In addition the present invention allows a manufacturer of cigarettes to apply additive materials to paper webs without adversely affecting the physical properties and integrity of that paper web to any significant degree. Registration of patterns e.g. bands applied to the paper wrapping materials of tobacco rods promotes the ability of cigarette manufacturers to provide consistent quality cigarette rods and the ability to control the properties of cigarettes through on line production techniques offers advantages over cigarettes that are manufactured using pre printed paper wrapping materials. The present invention also provides a manufacturer of cigarettes with the ability to ensure the production of high quality cigarettes with applied patterns registered in the desired locations of those cigarettes.

The paper wrapping material that is further processed to provide the patterned wrapping material can have a wide range of compositions and properties. The selection of a particular wrapping material will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette design and manufacture. Typical paper wrapping materials are manufactured from fibrous materials and optional filler materials to form so called base sheets. Wrapping materials of the present invention can be manufactured without significant modifications to the production techniques or processing equipment used to manufacture those wrapping materials.

Typical wrapping material base sheets suitable for use as the circumscribing wrappers of tobacco rods for cigarettes have basis weights that can vary. Typical dry basis weights of base sheets are at least about 15 g m and frequently are at least about 20 g m while typical dry basis weights do not exceed about 80 g m and frequently do not exceed about 60 g m. Many preferred wrapping material base sheets have basis weights of less than 50 g m and even less than 40 g m. Certain preferred paper wrapping material base sheets have basis weights between about 20 g mand about 30 g m.

Typical wrapping material base sheets suitable for use as the circumscribing wrappers of tobacco rods for cigarettes have inherent porosities that can vary. Typical base sheets have inherent porosities that are at least about 5 CORESTA units usually are at least about 10 CORESTA units often are at least about 15 CORESTA units and frequently are at least about 20 CORESTA units. Typical base sheets have inherent porosities that are less than about 200 CORESTA units usually are less than about 150 CORESTA units often are less than about 85 CORESTA units and frequently are less than about 70 CORESTA units. A CORESTA unit is a measure of the linear air velocity that passes through a 1 cmarea of wrapping material at a constant pressure of 1 centibar. See CORESTA Publication ISO TC0126 SC I N159E 1986 . The term inherent porosity refers to the porosity of that wrapping material itself to the flow of air. A particularly preferred paper wrapping material base sheet is composed of wood pulp and calcium carbonate and exhibits an inherent porosity of about 20 to about 50 CORESTA units.

Typical paper wrapping material base sheets suitable for use as the circumscribing wrappers of tobacco rods for cigarettes incorporate at least one type of fibrous material and can incorporate at least one filler material in amounts that can vary. Typical base sheets include about 55 to about 100 often about 65 to about 95 and frequently about 70 to about 90 percent fibrous material which most preferably is a cellulosic material such as wood pulp and about 0 to about 45 often about 5 to about 35 and frequently about 10 to about 30 percent filler material which most preferably is an inorganic material such as calcium carbonate based on the dry weight of that base sheet. Base sheets can have various additive materials incorporated therein and the base sheets can be physically treated e.g. the base sheets can be electrostatically perforated . Exemplary fibrous materials filler materials additives and physical treatments of papers are set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 303 648 filed Nov. 25 2002 and Ser. No. 10 324 837 filed Dec. 20 2002 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. See also US Patent Application 2003 0089377 to Hajaligol et al.

Typical paper wrapping materials that can be used in carrying out the present invention are manufactured under specifications directed toward the production of a wrapping material having an overall generally consistent composition and physical parameters. For those types of wrapping materials the composition and parameters thereof preferably are consistent when considered over regions of each of the major surfaces of those materials. However typical wrapping materials tend to have a two sided nature and thus there can be changes in the composition and certain physical parameters of those materials from one major surface to the other.

Though less preferred the wrapping material can be manufactured using a paper making process adapted to provide a base web comprising multiple layers of cellulosic material. See U.S. Pat. No. 5 143 098 to Rogers et al.

Much less preferred paper wrapping materials can have compositions and or properties that differ over different regions of each of their major surfaces. The wrapping material can have regions of increased or decreased porosity provided by control of the composition of that material such as by controlling the amount or type of the filler. The wrapping material can have regions of increased or decreased air permeability provided by embossing or perforating that material. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 945 932 to Mentzel et al. The wrapping material can have regions e.g. pre determined regions such as bands treated with additives such as certain of the aforementioned salts. However wrapping materials having a patterned nature are not necessary when various aspects of the present invention are used to apply patterns to those wrapping materials using on line pattern application techniques.

The composition of the additive material or coating formulation can vary. Generally the composition of the coating is determined by the ingredients of the coating formulation. Preferably the coating formulation has an overall composition and is applied in a manner and in an amount such that the physical integrity of the wrapping material is not adversely affected when the coating formulation is applied to selected regions of the wrapping material. It also is desirable that components of the coating formulation not introduce undesirable sensory characteristics to the smoke generated by a smoke article incorporating a wrapping material treated with that coating formulation. Thus suitable combinations of various components can act to reduce the effect of coatings on sensory characteristics of smoke generated by the smoking article during use.

A coating formulation can have a liquid syrup or paste form and is applied as such. Depending upon the actual ingredients that are combined with the solvent the coating formulation has the form of a liquid type of solution or of a liquid having solid materials dispersed therein. Certain other optional ingredients also are dissolved dispersed or suspended in that formulation. Additionally optional filler material also is dispersed within that formulation. Preferably the filler material is essentially insoluble and essentially chemically non reactive with the solvent at least at those conditions at which the formulation is employed. For example the material does not undergo significant undesirable chemical reaction when subjected to heat or radiation during the process conditions of the present invention.

The coating formulation most preferably includes a material that provides a film or otherwise acts as a film forming agent. Suitable combinations of various film forming agents also can be employed. Materials in the form of films have a tendency to adhere to a paper substrate maintain other components of the coating formulations in place and have the ability to lower the inherent porosity of the paper substrate and otherwise have an effect upon the performance characteristics of a cigarette incorporating such a treated paper.

In certain aspects of the present invention the film forming agent most preferably is a polymeric material or resin and such a film forming agent is applied to the desired location on the surface of a cigarette paper substrate within a solvent or liquid carrier. As such a solution or dispersion of a coating formulation is applied to the substrate and after removal of solvent or liquid carrier the film forming agent dries to form a film on that substrate. Exemplary polymeric film forming agents include water soluble polymeric materials such as starches.

In certain aspects of the present invention the film forming agent is applied to the desired location on the surface of a cigarette paper substrate as part of a coating formulation that is virtually absent of a solvent or liquid carrier e.g. the coating formulation can be characterized as being 100 percent solids in nature . Certain coating formulations that have been applied to the desired location on the surface of a cigarette paper substrate using contact application techniques. Contact application techniques involve the use of the roll applicator techniques set forth hereinbefore or other suitable techniques such as screen printing types of techniques. Screen printing technology is described in US Patent Application 2001 0042456 to Kamen et al. which is incorporated herein by reference. Suitable non contact application techniques e.g. ink jet type printing techniques also can be used to apply coating formulations to the paper substrate. Then those formulations are subjected to exposure to an effective amount of radiation in order to polymerize e.g. cross link certain components of those formulations and to ensure fixing or adherence of the components of those formulations to the desired locations on the paper substrate. As such the polymerizable components of those coating formulations are subjected to electromagnetic radiation capable of initiating photochemical reactions. Effective initiation of chemical reactions between those polymerizable components that have an overall liquid form results in polymerization e.g. cross linking reactions of those components and a resultant curing or solidification of polymerizable components.

Exemplary radiation curable polymerizable compositions are those compositions that comprise free radical polymerizable components e.g. free radical addition polymerizable components and most preferably compounds having terminal ethylenic unsaturation that are overall liquid in nature under those types of conditions under which those polymerizable compositions are handled and used. Such exemplary compositions are referred to as pre polymer compositions and typically comprise monomeric diluents that can be combined with oligomers preformed polymers or combinations of oligomers or preformed polymers. A monomeric diluent is a lower molecular weight compound e.g. a lower molecular weight ethylenically unsaturated compound that is a reactant in a polymerization reaction directly upon initiation by free radicals generated upon absorption of radiation. Typically an exemplary monomeric diluent is comprised of at least one monomeric compound having at least one terminal ethylenically unsaturated moiety. Alternatively pre polymer compositions can comprise condensation polymerizable components and suitable cross linking agents. For example pre polymer compositions comprising mixtures of cellulosic type materials and epoxides can be employed.

Representative types of monomic compounds diluents oligomers and preformed polymers techniques for applying those materials to substrates and techniques for curing those materials using radiation are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 563 644 to Isganitis et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 232 361 to Laksin et al. PCT WO 00 56554 and PCT WO 02 08309 US Patent Applications 2001 0042456 to Kamen et al. 2002 0004132 to Banovetz et al. 2003 0004223 to Khudyakov et al. 2003 0031843 to Wu et al. 2003 0032692 to Mejiritski et al. 2003 0064201 to Xing et al. 2003 0069363 to Greenblatt et al. and 2003 0073755 to Garnett et al. and US Stat. Inv. Reg. H1517 to Erickson et al. which are incorporated herein by reference.

Suitable radiation curable materials are available commercially from sources such as Sartomer Company Inc. Sun Chemical Corporation e.g. as products designated as Sunbeam LE Rohm Haas Company and Liofol Company. Exemplary pre polymer components that are suitable for providing coatings on paper webs incorporate polymerized ethylene type materials polymerized propylene type materials polymerized ethylene vinylacetate type formulations polymerized ethylene acrylic acid type formulations polymerized ethylene methacrylic acid type formulations polyvinyl alcohol formulations polystyrene formulations polyethylene formulations polypropylene formulations and the like. Exemplary pre polymer components that are suitable for providing coatings on paper webs incorporate suitable cross linking agents with low molecular weight polyesters low molecular weight cellulosics e.g. ethylcellulose or nitrocellulose low molecular weight polyurethanes low molecular weight nylons and the like.

Coating formulations incorporating pre polymer compositions can incorporate at least one initiator. Initiators are used when such coating formulations are cured using uv radiation and optionally can be used to some degree when such coating formulations are cured using electron beam radiation. Initiators can be characterized as free radical or cationic. Examples suitable initiators are the peroxide type initiators that include the diacyls peroxydicarbonates monoperoxycarbonates peroxyketals peroxyesters dialkyl peroxides and hydroperoxides. Initiators are commercially available such as Luperox F Luperox DC Luperox 130 Luperox 801 Luperox 230 and Luperox 231 from SpecialChem S. A. The amount of initiator that is employed can vary and is dependent upon factors such as the pre polymer material that is subjected to radiation for cure. Typically for uv curable pre polymer compositions the amount of initiator ranges from about 0.5 to about 6 percent and often about 1 to about 3 percent based on the weight of the pre polymer composition within the coating formulation. Numerous initiators are set forth in those references that has been cited hereinbefore and that disclose various radiation curable monomic compounds diluents oligomers and preformed polymers techniques for applying those materials to substrates and techniques for curing those materials using radiation. Certain water based uv curable systems using uv photoinitiators are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 623 001 to Figov which is incorporated herein by reference.

Certain additive materials can be applied to the wrapping material in the form of a coating formulation that is in a so called solid polymer form. Such coating formulations can be applied using contact application techniques or non contact application e.g. electrostatic deposition techniques. That is film forming materials such as ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers and certain starches can be mixed with other components of the coating formation and applied to the wrapping material without the necessity of dissolving those film forming materials in a suitable solvent. Typically solid polymer coating formulations are applied at elevated temperatures relative to ambient temperature and the viscosities of the film forming materials of those heated coating formulations typically have an extremely wide range of viscosities. Certain preferred heated solid polymer coating formulations have viscosities of about 1000 to about 5000 centipoise. Other exemplary components that are suitable for providing coatings for paper web are those that incorporate low molecular weight polymers and resins. Examples of polymers and resins include polyesters e.g. polyester terephlalate cellulosics e.g. ethylcellulose and nitrocellulose polyolefins e.g. polyethylene and polypropylene polyurethanes nylons polyvinyl alcohol polyaromatics e.g. polystyrene polyethylene vinylacetate polyethylene acrylic acid polyethylene methacrylic acid and the like.

Certain coating formulations that are used in carrying out certain aspects of the present invention can incorporate liquid solvents such as a liquid having an aqueous character as is set forth in Ser. No. 10 324 837 filed Dec. 20 2002. However typical coating formulations useful for carrying out certain aspects of the present invention i.e. those aspects that relate to the use a radiation curable coating formulations or electrostatic deposition formulations contain less than about 15 percent preferably less than about 10 percent more preferably less than about 5 percent and most preferably about 0 percent solvent or liquid carrier based on the total weight of the coating formulation just prior to application. Representative solvents and liquid carriers are liquids having aqueous characters and can include relatively pure water or non aqueous liquid solvents such as ethanol n propyl alcohol iso propyl alcohol ethyl acetate n propyl acetate iso propyl acetate toluene and the like. It is preferred that the radiation curable coating formulation contain a relatively low amount of solvent or liquid carrier it is highly preferred that such a coating formulation be essentially absent of solvent or liquid carrier and it is most highly preferred that the coating formulation be virtually free of i.e. not contain any solvent or liquid carrier. Exemplary solvents and liquid carriers and representative amounts of those solvents and liquid carriers used for coating formulations containing relatively high levels of those solvents and liquid carriers are set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 303 648 filed Nov. 25 2002 and Ser. No. 10 324 837 filed Dec. 20 2002.

The coating formulation also can include a filler material. Exemplary filler materials can be the essentially water insoluble types of filler materials of the type described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10 303 648 filed Nov. 25 2002. See also US Patent Application 2003 0089377 to Hajaligol et al. Preferred filler materials have a finely divided e.g. particulate form. Typical fillers are those that have particle sizes that are less than about 3 microns in diameter. Typical particle sizes of suitable fillers range from about 0.3 micron to 2 microns in diameter. The filler materials can have a variety of shapes. Exemplary filler materials are those that are composed of inorganic materials including metal particles and filings calcium carbonate e.g. precipitated type fillers including those having a prismatic form calcium phosphate clays e.g. attapulgite clay talc aluminum oxide mica magnesium oxide calcium sulfate magnesium carbonate magnesium hydroxide calcium phosphate aluminum oxide and titanium dioxide. See for example the types of filler materials set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 753 to Peterson et al. Representative calcium carbonate fillers are those available as Albacar PCC Albafil PCC Albaglos PCC Opacarb PCC Jetcoat PCC and Calopake F PCC from Specialty Minerals Inc. Exemplary filler materials also can be composed of natural or synthetic organic materials including starches modified starches and flours e.g. rice flour particles of polyvinyl alcohol particles of tobacco e.g. tobacco dust and other like materials. The filler material also can be fibrous cellulosic materials. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 417 228 to Baldwin et al. Although less preferred alternate fillers can include carbon based materials e.g. graphite type materials carbon fiber materials and ceramics metallic materials e.g. particles of iron and the like. The filler material also can be a water soluble salt e.g. potassium chloride sodium chloride potassium citrate sodium citrate calcium chloride or magnesium chloride . Exemplary salts are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4 622 983 to Mathews U.S. Pat. No. 4 941 485 to Perfetti et al and U.S. Pat. No. 5 220 930 to Gentry.

The coating formulations can incorporate other ingredients in addition to the aforementioned coating materials and those ingredients can be dispersed or suspended within the coating formulation. Those other ingredients can be employed in order to provide specific properties or characteristics to the wrapping material. Those ingredients can be preservatives e.g. potassium sorbate humectants e.g. ethylene glycol and propylene glycol pigments dyes colorants burn promoters and enhancers burn retardants and inhibitors plasticizers e.g. dibutyl phthalate polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol and triacetin sizing agents syrups e.g. high fructose corn syrup flavoring agents e.g. ethyl vanillin and caryophyllene oxide sugars e.g. rhamnose flavor precursors hydrate materials such as metal hydrates e.g. borax magnesium sulfate decahydrate sodium silicate pentahydrate and sodium sulfate decahydrate viscosity reducing agents e.g. urea and the like. Nanoparticle materials can be incorporated into such coating formulations such as is set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 342 618 filed Jan. 15 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference. If desired the coating formulations can contain dyes or pigments for aesthetic purposes e.g. those components can provide white black gray blue or brown colors or to facilitate automated inspection of paper wrapping materials to which the formulations are applied.

For a coating formulation that employs a liquid solvent or carrier the amount of such solvent or liquid carrier typically makes up about at least about 20 percent of the formulation and often makes up at least about 30 percent of the formulation based on the weight of the formulation.

For a coating formulation that employs a radiation curable pre polymer formulation the relative amounts of the various components of that formulation can vary. Most preferably such a coating formulation includes at least about 5 percent material that is cured to provide the film forming agent usually at least about 10 percent of that agent and often at least about 15 percent of that agent based on the total weight of that formulation. The material that is cured to form the film forming agent can comprise approximately all i.e. about 100 weight percent of the coating formulation. Typically the amount of film forming agent within such a coating formulation does not exceed about 30 percent usually does not exceed about 20 percent and often does not exceed about 15 percent based on the total weight of that formulation.

Typically the amount of optional filler material within the coating formulation does not exceed about 70 percent and usually does not exceed about 50 percent based on the total weight of that formulation.

The amounts of other optional components of the various coating formulations can vary depending upon factors such as the type of coating formulation that is employed and the desired properties of the coated substrate. When employed the amount of plasticizer often ranges from about 0.5 percent to about 5 percent preferably about 2 to about 3 percent based on the total weight of the formulation.

Flavoring agents can be incorporated into the coating formulations. Preferably the flavoring agents exhibit sensory characteristics that can be described as having notes that are sweet woody fruity or some combination thereof. The flavoring agents preferably are employed in amounts that depend upon their individual detection thresholds. Typically the flavoring agents are employed in sufficient amounts so as to mask or ameliorate the off tastes and malodors associated with burning paper. Combinations of flavoring agents e.g. a flavor package can be employed in order to provide desired overall sensory characteristics to smoke generated from the smoking articles incorporating those flavoring agents. Most preferably those flavoring agents are employed in amounts and manners so that the sensory characteristics of those flavoring agents are hardly detectable and those flavoring agents do not adversely affect the overall sensory characteristics of smoking article into which they are incorporated. Preferred flavoring agents can be incorporated into printing formulations have low vapor pressures do not have a tendency to migrate or evaporate under normal ambient conditions and are stable under the processing conditions experienced by wrapping materials of the present invention. Exemplary flavoring agents that provide sweet notes include ethyl vanillin vanillin heliotropin methylcyclopentenolone and those flavoring agents typically are employed in amounts of 0.001 to about 0.01 percent based on the total weight of the coating formulation into which they are incorporated.

The amount of coating formulation that is applied to the paper wrapping material can vary. Typically coating of the wrapping material provides a coated wrapping material having an overall dry basis weight i.e. the basis weight of the whole wrapping material including coated and uncoated regions of at least about 1.05 times often at least about 1.1 times and frequently at least about 1.2 times that of the dry basis weight of that wrapping material prior to the application of coating thereto. Typically coating of the wrapping material provides a coated paper having an overall dry basis weight of not more about 1.4 times and often not more than about 1.3 times that of the dry basis weight of the wrapping material that has the coating applied thereto. Typical overall dry basis weights of those wrapping materials are about 20 g mto about 40 g m preferably about 25 g mto about 35 g m. For example a paper wrapping material having a dry basis weight of about 25 g mcan be coated in accordance with the present invention to have a resulting overall dry basis weight of about 26.5 g mto about 35 g m and often about 28 g mto about 32 g m.

The dry weights of the coated regions of wrapping material of the present invention can vary. For wrapping materials that are used for the manufacture of cigarettes designed to meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria it is desirable that the wrapping materials have sufficient coating formulation applied thereto to in the form of appropriately shaped and spaced bands in order that the dry weight of additive material applied to those wrapping materials totals at least about 1 pound ream often at least about 2 pounds ream and frequently at least about 3 pounds ream while the total dry weight of that applied additive material normally does not exceed about 10 pounds ream.

Typical coated regions of paper wrapping materials of the present invention that are suitable for use as the circumscribing wrappers of tobacco rods for cigarettes have inherent porosities that can vary. Typically the inherent porosities of the coated regions of the wrapping materials are less than about 8.5 CORESTA units usually are less than about 8 CORESTA units often are less than about 7 CORESTA units and frequently are less than about 6 CORESTA units. Typically the inherent porosities of the coated regions of the wrapping materials are at least about 0.1 CORESTA unit usually are at least about 0.5 CORESTA unit often are at least about 1 CORESTA unit. Preferably the inherent porosities of the coated regions of the wrapping materials particularly those wrapping materials that are used for the manufacture of cigarettes designed to meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria are between about 0.1 CORESTA unit and about 4 CORESTA units.

The paper wrapping material of the present invention can have can be coated in patterns having predetermined shapes. The coating can have the form of cross directional lines or bands including those that are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the wrapping material stripes grids longitudinally extending lines circles hollow circles dots ovals checks spirals swirls helical bands diagonally crossing lines or bands triangles hexagonals honeycombs ladder type shapes zig zag shaped stripes or bands sinusoidal shaped stripes or bands square wave shaped stripes or bands patterns composed of coated regions that are generally C or U shaped patterns composed of coated regions that are generally E shaped patterns composed of coated regions that are generally S shaped patterns composed of coated regions that are generally T shaped patterns composed of coated regions that are generally V shaped patterns composed of coated regions that are generally W shaped patterns composed of coated regions that are generally X shaped patterns composed of coated regions that are generally Z shaped or other desired shapes. Combinations of the foregoing shapes also can used to provide the desired pattern.

The relative sizes or dimensions of the various shapes and designs can be selected as desired. For example shapes of coated regions compositions of the coating formulations or amounts or concentrations of coating materials can change over the length of the wrapping material. The relative positioning of the printed regions can be selected as desired. For example wrapping materials that are used for the production of cigarettes designed to meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria the pattern most preferably has the form of spaced continuous bands that are aligned transversely or cross directionally to the longitudinal axis of the wrapping material. However cigarettes can be manufactured from wrapping materials possessing discontinuous bands positioned in a spaced apart relationship. For wrapping materials of those cigarettes it is most preferred that discontinuous bands e.g. bands that are composed of a pattern such as a series of dots grids or stripes cover at least about 70 percent of the surface of the band area or region of the wrapping material.

Preferred wrapping materials possess coatings in the form of bands that extend across the wrapping material generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the wrapping material. The widths of the individual bands can vary as well as the spacings between those bands. Typically those bands have widths of at least about 0.5 mm usually at least about 1 mm frequently at least about 2 mm and most preferably at least about 3 mm. Often those bands have widths of up to about 10 mm typically up to about 8 mm and usually up to about 7 mm. Preferred bands have widths of about 4 mm to about 7 mm. Such bands can be spaced apart such that the spacing between the bands is at least about 10 mm often at least about 15 mm frequently at least about 20 mm often at least about 25 mm in certain instances at least about 30 mm and on occasion at least about 35 mm but such spacing usually does not exceed about 50 mm.

Paper wrapping materials of the present invention are useful as components of smoking articles such as cigarettes. Preferably one layer of the wrapping material of the present invention is used as the wrapping material circumscribing the smokable material and thereby forming the tobacco rod of a cigarette. In one regard it is preferable that the wrapping material possesses the coated regions located on the wire side thereof and the wire side of that wrapping material forms the inner surface of the circumscribing wrapping material of the tobacco rod. Typically the felt side of the wrapping material is used as the visible outer surface of the tobacco rod. The terms wire side and felt side in referring to the major surfaces of paper sheet are readily understood as terms of art to those skilled in the art of paper and cigarette manufacture.

Cigarettes of the present invention can be manufactured from a variety of components and can have a wide range of formats and configurations. Typical cigarettes of the present invention having cross directional bands applied to the wrapping materials of the tobacco rods of those cigarettes have static burn rates i.e. burn rates of those cigarettes under non puffing conditions of about 50 to about 60 mg tobacco rod weight per minute in the non banded regions of those cigarettes. Typical cigarettes of the present invention having cross directional bands applied to the wrapping materials of the tobacco rods of those cigarettes have static burn rates i.e. burn rates of those cigarettes under non puffing conditions of less than about 50 mg tobacco rod weight per minute preferably about 40 to about 45 mg tobacco rod weight per minute in the banded regions of those cigarettes.

The smokable materials used for the manufacture of cigarettes of the present invention can vary. The smokable material typically consists primarily of tobacco and it is preferred that the smokable material be virtually all tobacco. Descriptions of various types of tobaccos growing practices harvesting practices and curing practices are set for in Davis et al. Eds. 1999 . The tobacco normally is used in cut filler form e.g. shreds or strands of tobacco filler cut into widths of about 1 10 inch to about 1 60 inch preferably about 1 20 inch to about 1 35 inch and in lengths of about inch to about 3 inches . The amount of tobacco filler normally used within a cigarette ranges from about 0.6 g to about 1 g. The tobacco filler normally is employed so as to filler the tobacco rod at a packing density of about 100 mg cmto about 300 mg cm and often about 150 mg cmto about 275 mg cm. Tobaccos can have a processed form such as processed tobacco stems e.g. cut rolled or cut puffed stems volume expanded tobacco e.g. puffed tobacco such as propane expanded tobacco and dry ice expanded tobacco DIET or reconstituted tobacco e.g. reconstituted tobaccos manufactured using paper making type or cast sheet type processes .

Typically tobacco materials for cigarette manufacture are used in a so called blended form. For example certain popular tobacco blends commonly referred to as American blends comprise mixtures of flue cured tobacco burley tobacco and Oriental tobacco and in many cases certain processed tobaccos such as reconstituted tobacco and processed tobacco stems. The precise amount of each type of tobacco within a tobacco blend used for the manufacture of a particular cigarette brand varies from brand to brand. See for example Voges Ed. p. 44 45 1984 Browne 3Ed. p. 43 1990 and Davis et al. Eds. p. 346 1999 . In addition the smokable material can be cased and or top dressed and or at least one flavor component can be incorporated within the side seam adhesive applied to the wrapping material during tobacco rod manufacture. See for example U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 303 648 filed Nov. 25 2002.

Cigarette wrapping materials manufactured in accordance with the present invention can be used to manufacture a wide variety of cigarettes. Exemplary cigarettes and exemplary components parameters and specifications thereof are of the type set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4 924 888 to Perfetti et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 056 537 to Brown et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 220 930 to Gentry and U.S. Pat. No. 5 360 023 to Blakely et al. PCT WO 02 37990 US Patent Application 2002 0166563 and Ser. No. 10 285 395 filed Oct. 31 2002 and Bombick et al. 39 p. 11 17 1997 which are incorporated herein by reference.

There are several factors that determine a specific coating pattern for a wrapping material of the present invention. It is desirable that the components of the coating formulations applied to wrapping materials not adversely affect to any significant degree i the appearance of cigarettes manufactured from those wrapping materials ii the nature or quality of the smoke generated by those cigarettes iii the desirable burn characteristics of those cigarettes or iv the desirable performance characteristics of those cigarettes. It also is desirable that wrapping materials having coating formulations applied thereto not introduce undesirable off taste or otherwise adversely affect the sensory characteristics of the smoke generated by cigarettes manufactured using those wrapping materials. In addition preferred cigarettes of the present invention do not have a tendency to undergo premature extinction such as when lit cigarettes are held in the smoker s hand or when placed in an ashtray for a brief period of time.

For an exemplary full flavor cigarette having a tobacco rod length of about 63 mm and a filter element length of about 21 mm cross directional bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 20 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. Alternatively for those types of cigarettes bands of about 4 mm width can be spaced at about 22 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. Alternatively for those types of cigarettes bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 39 mm intervals. For an exemplary full flavor cigarette having a tobacco rod length of about 70 mm and a filter element length of about 30 mm cross directional bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 44 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. For an exemplary ultra low tar cigarette having a tobacco rod length of about 57 mm and a filter element length of about 27 mm cross directional bands of about 7 mm width can be spaced at about 20 mm intervals. Alternatively for those types of cigarettes bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 33 mm intervals or at about 39 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. For an exemplary ultra low tar cigarette having a tobacco rod length of about 68 mm and a filter element length of about 31 mm cross directional bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 44 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. Full flavor cigarettes are classified as those that yield about 14 mg or more of FTC tar. Ultra low tar cigarettes are classified as those that yield less than about 7 mg of FTC tar. Those cigarettes have tobacco rods having appropriate wrapping materials possessing bands composed of appropriate amounts of appropriate components have the ability to meet the aforementioned cigarette extinction criteria.

Certain preferred paper wrapping materials used in carrying out the present invention are useful for the manufacture of cigarettes designed to exhibit reduced ignition propensity. That is cigarettes incorporating certain wrapping materials when placed on a flammable substrate tend to self extinguish before burning that substrate. Of particular interest are those cigarettes possessing tobacco rods manufactured using appropriate wrapping materials possessing bands composed of appropriate amounts of appropriate components so as to have the ability to meet certain cigarette extinction criteria.

Cigarettes designed to meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria can be produced from wrapping materials of the present invention. Banded regions on a wrapping material are produced using additive materials that are effective in reducing the inherent porosity of the wrapping material in those regions. Film forming materials and fillers applied to the wrapping material in those banded regions are effective in increasing the weight of the wrapping material in those regions. Filler materials that are applied to the wrapping material in those banded regions are effective in decreasing the burn rate of the wrapping materials in those regions. Typically when wrapping materials of relatively high inherent porosity are used to manufacture cigarettes those wrapping materials possess relatively high weight bands that introduce a relatively low inherent porosity to the banded regions. Film forming materials have a tendency to reduce the porosity of the wrapping material whether or not those materials are used in conjunction with fillers. However coatings that combine porosity reduction with added coating weight to wrapping materials also are effective in facilitating extinction of cigarettes manufactured from those wrapping materials. Low porosity in selected regions of a wrapping material tends to cause a lit cigarette to extinguish due to the decrease in access to oxygen for combustion for the smokable material within that wrapping material. Increased weight of the wrapping material also tends to cause lit cigarette incorporating that wrapping material to extinguish. As the inherent porosity of the wrapping material increases it also is desirable to i select a film forming material so as to cause a decrease the inherent porosity of the coated region of the wrapping material and or ii provide a coating that provides a relatively large amount of added weight to the coated region of the wrapping material.

Certain cigarettes possessing tobacco rods manufactured using certain appropriately treated wrapping materials when tested using the methodology set forth in the Cigarette Extinction Test Method by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Publication 851 1993 using 10 layers of Whatman No. 2 filter paper can meet criteria requiring extinction of greater than about 50 percent preferably greater than about 75 percent and most preferably about 100 percent of cigarettes tested. Certain cigarettes possessing tobacco rods manufactured using certain appropriately treated wrapping materials when tested using the methodology set forth in ASTM Designation E 2187 02b using 10 layers of Whatman No. 2 filter paper also can meet criteria requiring extinction of greater than about 50 percent preferably greater than about 75 percent and most preferably about 100 percent of cigarettes tested.

For cigarettes designed to meet those aforementioned extinction criteria each such cigarette typically possesses at least one band located in a region of its tobacco rod such that the band is capable of providing that cigarette with the ability to meet those extinction criteria. For a tobacco rod of a particular length incorporating a wrapping material possessing bands that are aligned transversely to the longitudinal axis of the wrapping material in a spaced apart relationship the ratio of the length of the tobacco rod to the sum of the width of a band and the distance between the bands is 1 to 2 preferably about 1.1 to about 1.4 and most preferably about 1.2. Alternatively bands can be positioned at virtually identical predetermined locations on each rod e.g. each cigarette can have one band positioned 20 mm from the lighting end thereof or each cigarette can have two bands one band positioned at 15 mm from the lighting end thereof and the second band positioned at 30 mm from the lighting end .

Representative cigarettes can be manufactured using paper wrapping materials that are printed off line using electrostatic deposition techniques. A template can be provided on a sheet of multipurpose business paper commonly used for office photocopying. A representative template sheet has a size of about 8.5 inches by about 11 inches. The template is provided as a pattern made up of a series of black bands each band of 5 mm width and extending 8.5 inches across the width of the template sheet and successive leading edges of the bands are separated from one another by 25 mm. Onto a similar second sheet of paper are taped six strips of cigarette paper web. Each strip is about 11 inches long and the strips are aligned parallel to one another so that each strip covers that second sheet extends along the length of that second paper sheet. The cigarette paper that is used to provide those strips is the type available as Reference No. 456 from Ecusta Corp. The template sheet is placed on the imaging region of a Canon Imagerunner 400S copier. The second sheet is placed in the in feed tray of the copier. The image from the template is copied onto the second sheet so that the image from the template in copied onto the cigarette paper strips. As such each cigarette paper strip of 11 inch length has a series of black bands of 5 mm width and the leading edges of those bands are spaced at 25 mm and those bands each extend transversely to the longitudinal axis of that paper strip. The resulting paper strips are used to made handmade cigarettes such as cigarettes of the format and configuration of Camel Light 85 brand cigarettes that are manufactured by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Cigarettes of such a type can have the ability to consistently meet certain cigarette extinction criteria such as the Cigarette Extinction Test Method by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Publication 851 1993 using 10 layers of Whatman No. 2 filter paper. As such electrostatic deposition of photocopier toner material as a plurality of bands on a cigarette paper wrapper and the fusing of that deposited toner to that paper provides a way for manufacturing a cigarette that has a propensity to extinguish such a cigarette when the fire cone of that cigarette reached such a band. That is fusion of the plastic based components of the toner material to the paper in selected regions provides that paper with a character that has the potential to promote extinguishment of a cigarette manufactured from that paper e.g. fusion of plastic based toner components to the paper can reduce the inherent porosity of that paper in the printed regions .
