This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application 60 595 569 filed on Jul. 15 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to plotting boards used to plot firing missions for a munition.

Soldiers may use a plotting board to calculate and plot firing missions for for example a mortar weapon system. The method of using the plotting board is known. A known plotting board comprises a base with a vertical pin or axle in its center. A top disk has a central hole and fits over the vertical pin in the base. The top disk also has a retaining clip to keep the disk in place. When the disk is removed from the base the disk often fractures. Furthermore because a soldier may slide a ruler across the base when plotting a fire mission the presence of the vertical pin is an obstacle to effective use of the ruler. Thus there is a need for a plotting board that is easier to use and disassemble.

It is an object of the invention to provide a plotting board having a surface substantially free of vertical projections.

It is another object of the invention to provide a plotting board having a top that is easily removed and reattached.

It is a further object of the invention to provide a plotting board wherein the top is held tightly to the bottom to minimize plotting error.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a base a top a pivot that connects the top and the base the top and the base being rotatable and detachable with respect to each other the pivot including a magnet wherein at least a portion of the pivot is disposed at a substantially central point on the top. Preferably the base and top comprise plates. The pivot includes male and female mating portions with the male portion disposed on one of the base and the top and the female portion disposed on the other of the base and the top.

The magnet may be disposed on the base or on the top. In one embodiment the male and female mating portions comprise cylindrical shapes. In another embodiment the male and female portions comprise frustro conical shapes. Preferably the top plate is substantially transparent and substantially circular.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

In one embodiment the apparatus of the invention is a plotting board for use in calculating and plotting fire missions. However the apparatus may be used in other applications as well.

The pivot includes a magnet . The magnet may be disposed on the base as shown or on the top . The magnet may be integral with or separate from the base top male portion or female portion . If the top or male portion includes the magnet then a part of the base or female portion comprises a magnetic material that is attracted to the magnet . Similarly if the base or female portion comprises the magnet then a part of the top or male portion comprises a magnetic material that is attracted to the magnet. In this context magnetic material includes any material that is attracted to a magnet such as ferrous material and also includes a second magnet. If a second magnet is used then the poles of the magnet and the second magnet are disposed so that the top is attracted to the base .

The magnetic pivot of the invention provides a means to easily attach and reattach the top to the base without fracturing the top. The magnetic pivot further provides a secure connection between the top and the base to minimize errors in calculations. In addition the magnetic pivot does not protrude vertically above the top so that a ruler can slide smoothly over the plotting board.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
