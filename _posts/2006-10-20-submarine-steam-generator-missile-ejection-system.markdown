title: Submarine steam generator missile ejection system
abstract: A steam generator missile ejection system has a vessel that contains water that becomes the pressurized steam source for missile ejection. A heating system within the vessel heats the water to steam and to the desired launch pressure. The heater is controlled to sequence operation and heat generation with a command from a controller shortly before initiation of a firing valve. A valve controls piping from the vessel to direct steam to a piping header and onto the ejection chamber of a launch tube. This event provides the launch pulse required to eject the payload from the missile tube. The launch energy requirements can be modulated by varying the pre-launch temperature of the water in the pressure vessel and can be controlled by an opening rate and length of open duration of the valve.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to a missile ejection system and more particularly to an ejection system using steam as a prime mover or dynamic force to eject a missile.

Current naval missile ejection systems are totally reliant on ordnance gas generators. Ordnance gas generators produce a hot exhaust gas via a controlled propellant burn that provides the dynamic force used to eject the missile from a missile launch tube or capsule.

The ordnance gas generator was preceded in early launching systems by a high pressure air systems. The high pressure air systems were large and complex due to requirements for air flasks piping and associated isolation valves. The move to gas generators was necessitated by a need to reduce system complexity reduce maintenance and increased launching system operational confidence.

However ordnance gas generators have brought the added burden of explosive ordnance safety concerns. These safety concerns include significant costs for safe transport bunkering and test firings to ensure explosive grain stability and safe ejection performance. Additional costs for aging performance of the grain using analysis and live fire tests are expensive.

Also when gas generators reach the expected acceptable performance end of life the generators must be disposed at a typically high cost due to explosive and hazardous material. Overall the cost in labor analysis documentation and logistical storage and transport needed to support current gas generator technology is significant.

As such a need exists to remove hazardous material disposal costs for post missile launches and costs associated with outdated or exceeding operational service life disposal of gas generators.

A further need exists to eliminate explosive ordnance bunker maintenance and personnel monitoring costs.

As discussed below alternative methods for submerged missile ejection are the current use of gas generators or a return to the use of high pressure air for an ejection pulse.

Paterro U.S. Pat. No. 6 290 184 describes two steam generators combined with air compressors that supposedly produce a constant flow of steam and air for propulsion. However the cited reference does not describe a static pressure vessel that contains water at high temperature and pressure until a firing valve allows an explosive release of pressure thus flashing the water to steam and providing thrust for missile ejection.

Barakauskas U.S. Pat. No. 3 182 554 discloses a solid fuel gas generator for the missile ejection system. The cited reference discloses that the water contained in a cooling chamber has a primary use of cooling a high temperature ejection gas from a gas generator. The high temperature ejection gas needs to be cooled to prevent damage to the missile structure and rocket motor. Therefore the water in this case is primarily used for hot ejection gas cooling with some residual thrust provided when the cooling water flashes to steam. The cited reference does not use water heated to steam and pressurized in a pressure vessel to provide the sole means of eject thrust for a missile or other payload from a launch tube.

Pauletich U.S. Pat. No. 3 944 019 is designed as a constant source of steam suspended from a cable at sea. The steam would be pulsed into a bell chamber to produce a sound pulse supposedly useful for geological study of the ocean floor. The cited reference does not have a static pressure vessel filled with water that would be maintained when armed to eject a missile at high temperature and pressure until a firing valve allows an explosive release of pressure.

Nissley Jr. U.S. Pat. No. 4 014 246 uses a boiler to provide a steam source to a pressurized volume referred to as a rocket for launching a flying vehicle from a ground rail launch system. In the cited reference the steam producing boiler is separate from the pressurized volume rocket and is connected via a piping header from the boiler to the pressurized volume. The cited reference is not structurally designed as a single unit that incorporates a pressure vessel water supply system electrical energy resistance heater to heat the water and firing valve in a common unit.

Johnson U.S. Pat. No. 4 724 738 describes a design that does not utilize a pressure vessel to contain a heated pressurized water source. The water used in the cited reference is contained in the Rocket launch cylinder and functions primarily as a cooling source to lower the temperature of the rocket booster motor when initiated. The cited reference does not utilize a pressure vessel to contain a heated pressurized water volume until the firing valve releases the pressurized water that flashes to steam and ejections the missile or payload from the launch tube.

Lenz U.S. Pat. No. 4 767 364 describes a ship propulsion source using a steam boiler and piped steam sourcing two propulsion jets fixed to the aft end of a ship. This cited reference does not utilize a static pressure vessel to contain a heated and pressurized water source designed for explosive release of steam to launch a missile or payload for a missile launch tube.

Turner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 737 962 utilizes a steam source from a boiler that is piped to a torpedo test stand. The piped steam source is connected to a torpedo propulsion afterbody and thus provides the energy required to operate the propulsion motor at rated speed and power without using toxic fuel that is typically used for torpedo propulsion. However the cited reference is not designed as a unitary pressure vessel missile steam ejection launching source.

Accordingly it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a variable ejection energy pulse system suitable to launch diverse payloads.

A further object of the present invention is to provide a system using currently available shipboard sources of electrical power and de mineralized water.

Other objects and advantages are attained with the submarine steam generator missile ejection system SSGMES of the present invention which generally include a pressure vessel that contains heated and pressurized water that becomes the steam source for missile ejection. An electrical resistance heating system heats the water to the desired temperature for steam and launch pressure.

An ejection system firing valve and an associated ejection header manifold isolates and directs a steam ejection pulse from the pressure vessel to an ejection discharge header and onto an ejection chamber of a launch tube.

The pressure vessel is sized for the swept volume needed to provide a saturated steam ejection pulse for the heaviest payload and or multiple ejection pulses supporting a missile salvo launch. The pressure vessel is encapsulated in an insulating jacket to reduce energy consumption and to ensure personnel safety.

A first stage heater and a second stage heater of the electrical heating system provides the energy to raise the pressure of the water contained inside the pressure vessel. The second stage heater ensures a thoroughly vaporized high temperature steam flow from the pressure vessel for missile ejection. The second stage heater is controlled in a manner that sequences operation and heat generation with a Prepare command from a controller shortly before initiation of the firing valve. The second stage heater is switched off with the initiation command of the firing valve. The launch energy requirements of the SSGMES can be modulated by varying the pre launch temperature of the water in the pressure vessel.

The firing valve functions as the pressure isolator of the system. When the pressure vessel is heated and pressurized to the launch ejection energy needs the opening of the firing valve initiates steam release from the pressure vessel and subsequent flow via the ejection header manifold to the missile launch tube ejection chamber. This event provides the ejection steam launch pulse required to eject the payload from the missile tube. The launch energy requirements can be controlled by the opening rate and length of open duration of the ejection firing valve.

Referring now to the submarine steam generator missile ejection system SSGMES of the present invention primarily comprises a pressure vessel that contains heated and pressurized water that becomes the steam source for missile ejection. An electrical resistance heating system having a first stage heater and a second stage heater contained inside the pressure vessel heats the water to the desired temperature and launch pressure.

The SSGMES also includes an ejection system firing valve that isolates the pressure vessel to direct the steam ejection pulse to an ejection discharge header and onto the bottom ejection chamber of a launch tube not shown . A de mineralized water filling and drain system is used to fill or drain the pressure vessel .

The pressure vessel is preferably weldment constructed of stainless steel certified for high temperature pressures however other suitable materials known to those ordinarily skilled in the art may be used. Also the pressure vessel is sized for the sweeping volume needed to provide a saturated steam ejection pulse for the heaviest payload and or multiple ejection pulses supporting missile salvo launch requirements. The pressure vessel includes a mechanically bolted discharge and upper access flange fluidly connected to the firing valve and associated ejection piping header . The upper access flange allows inspection and repairs access to the upper heating element .

The pressure vessel has an additional mechanical flange for inspection and repair of the lower heating element of the two stage resistance heating system. The lower mechanical flange incorporates a pipe stud welded to a flange plate . The pipe stud is approximately 6 long and functions as a well for solid particles to accumulate in and as an entry point for the de mineralized water fill and drain system . The pressure vessel is encapsulated in an insulating jacket to reduce energy consumption and to ensure personnel safety.

A first stage heater and second stage heater of the two stage electrical heating system provide the energy to raise the temperature and pressure of the water contained inside the pressure vessel . The first stage heater is a large surface area resistance heating element located in the lower section of the pressure vessel . The first stage heater transforms the water in the pressure vessel to the desired saturated steam temperature and launch pressure. The heating element of the first stage heater operates from a four forty 440 VAC electricity source typically in a submarine not shown .

The heating element of the second stage heater is located adjacent to the upper access flange . The function of the second stage heater is to ensure a thoroughly vaporized high temperature steam flow from the pressure vessel for missile ejection. The second stage heater allows the steam to freely pass to the ejection piping while adding heat to the ejection pulse. The coil design of the second stage heater which accommodates high flow rates has a large surface area for sufficient heat transfer to the steam flow to ensure that the flashed steam is finely atomized. The second stage heater is provided by the four forty 440 VAC electricity source for power and is controlled in a manner that would sequence operation and heat generation with a Prepare command from a controller not shown shortly before initiation of the firing valve . The second stage heater is switched off with the initiation command of the firing valve . The launch energy requirements of the SSGMES can be modulated by varying the desired pre launch temperature of the water in the pressure vessel .

The firing valve is located adjacent or near the upper access flange and functions as the pressure isolator of the SSGMES. When the water in the pressure vessel is heated and pressurized to the launch ejection energy needs the opening of the firing valve initiates steam flow to the missile launch tube ejection chamber. This event provides the ejection steam launch pulse required to eject the payload from the missile tube. The launch energy requirements of the SSGMES can be controlled by opening rate and length of open duration of the ejection firing valve .

As stated above the de mineralized water fill and drain system provides a means to fill or drain the pressure vessel . The point of attachment is preferably at the pipe stud . Filling is accomplished by opening isolation valves and operating a positive displacement pump that supplies de mineralized water to the pressure vessel . A pipe tee and drain isolation valve on the fill line serve to drain the system water to a bilge or alternate drain collection system.

The pressure vessel includes various monitoring systems that can be used for control of the SSGMES or to support other indicating systems. These include a lower temperature sensor for the first stage heater and an upper temperature sensor for the second stage heater . Also a pressure sensing system including a gauge gauge valve and root valve are provided to indicate whether adequate steam pressure exists for a missile launch.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
