The present invention relates to a coating liquid for nickel film formation a nickel film and a production method thereof. More particularly the present invention relates to a coating liquid capable of forming a nickel film having an excellent electroconductivity on a heat resistant substrate such as made of glass and ceramic or the like by a coating method particularly inkjet printing conveniently and at a low cost a nickel film formed by the coating liquid and a production method thereof.

Typically there have been used metal materials excellent in electroconductivity as signal electrodes of a display device such as a liquid crystal display LCD an electroluminescence device ELD and a plasma display PDP and as electrodes of various circuit boards such that copper aluminum silver nickel and the like are utilized depending on usages.

Here as the conventional methods for forming metal electrodes there have been widely used physical techniques such as a vacuum deposition method and a sputtering method. These methods are capable of forming uniform metal films excellent in electroconductivity on substrates.

However film formation apparatus to be used for the methods are based on vacuum vessels to become expensive and require that the production apparatus are to be vacuumed for each film formation on a substrate thereby exhibiting problems of production cost and mass productivity. Further it is required to form a resist and to conduct etching thereto so as to work a metal film into a predetermined pattern which leads to an increased number of processes thereby problematically lowering the productivity and leading to a higher cost.

To deal with the above described problems there have been proposed production methods hereinafter called coating methods as the case may be each configured to adopt a coating liquid for electroconductive film formation comprising a solvent containing silver or copper nanoparticles dispersed therein in patent documents 1 to 3 respectively. According to such methods there are formed electroconductive films such as made of silver copper and the like by a simple production process including coating drying and calcining of a coating liquid for electroconductive film formation onto and on a substrate. This has been carried out by successfully utilizing such a tendency that fine particles of silver copper and the like are fusion bonded to one another even at low temperatures by virtue of effects of nanoparticle sizes of them.

Although the coating methods can be applied to nanoparticles susceptible to fusion bonding there is deteriorated a quality of an obtained film i.e. the film is porous in case of a metal insusceptible to fusion bonding such as nickel particles so that the coating methods have not been put into a practical use except for usage where calcining is conducted at a high temperature of about 1 000 C. such as in case of a multilayer ceramic capacitor. Further since nickel is ferromagnetic nickel fine particles tend to aggregate in a coating liquid when the coating liquid is low in viscosity thereby also exhibiting a problem of stability of the coating liquid.

Thus as a coating liquid which has improved the problems there has been proposed a nickel film formation paste which adopts a molecular nickel source obtained by dissolving nickel formate in monoethanol amine 2 amino ethanol boiling point 171 C. as described in a patent document 4 for example. Further there has been proposed a nickel film formation paste in a patent document 5 which is obtained by dissolving organic nickel such as nickel acetate in a glycol based solvent. According to these methods the pastes are printed by screen printing for example and fired at temperatures at about 400 C. in a nitrogen gas to obtain nickel electroconductive films respectively.

Incidentally extensive researches have been recently conducted for inkjet printing as a method for carrying out coating and forming of a fine pattern with an excellent resolution upon formation of an electroconductive film based on a coating method and coating liquids therefor have been thus sought for which are excellent in ink jetting ability which are excellent in film forming ability which are free of occurrence of defects such as cising phenomenon where a coating liquid is decreased to a size smaller than a printed pattern due to defective wettability of the coating liquid and bleeding phenomenon where a coating liquid is spread to a size wider than a printed pattern due to excessive wettability of the coating liquid and which are excellent in film characteristics such as electroconductivity.

However screen printing is assumed and the coating liquids are each high in viscosity in case of the nickel film formation paste of the patent document 4 obtained by dissolving formic acid in monoethanol amine and the nickel film formation paste of the patent document 5 obtained by dissolving organic nickel such as nickel acetate in a glycol based solvent so that these pastes fully fail to conform to a viscosity of as low as about 5 to 20 mPa s assumed to be optimum for ink jetting ability in case of inkjet printing resulting in failure of application of the pastes to inkjet printing.

Further even if the patent document 4 is altered to prepare a nickel film formation ink having a low viscosity by adopting nickel formate and monoethanol amine such an ink will be poor in film forming ability and unsatisfactory in densification degree of a film thereby failing to obtain a nickel electroconductive film which possesses sufficient film characteristics combined possession of all of appropriate resistance value film strength film uniformity surface roughness and the like . Moreover monoethanol amine is a deleterious substance such that the coating liquid containing monoethanol amine in excess of 20 is also classified as a deleterious substance thereby also exhibiting a defect of inferior handling ability.

Here in case of preparation of a nickel film formation ink having a low viscosity by nickel formate and an amine based solvent the amine based solvent is alkaline thereby bringing about a possibility that a substrate to which the ink is applied is deteriorated depending on the nature of the substrate because the amine based solvent acts as alkali. Examples of substrates susceptible to degradation by alkali include silicon oxide based ones. Thus depending on substrates to be adopted it has been additionally required to decrease the blending amount of an amine based solvent as less as possible in a nickel film formation ink.

Further there has been desired film formation at lower temperatures such as about 200 to 250 C. because achievement thereof enables a widened applicability of a nickel film formation ink in case of forming a nickel film by coating the nickel film formation ink onto a substrate.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a coating liquid for nickel film formation capable of forming a nickel film combinedly having an excellent electroconductivity and an excellent film forming ability surface flatness by a coating method particularly inkjet printing conveniently and at a low cost a nickel film obtained by using the coating liquid and a production method thereof.

According to the coating liquid for nickel film formation of the present invention it becomes possible to obtain a coating liquid having a viscosity suitable for a coating method such as inkjet printing and excellent film forming ability printability and liquid stability. Further since the nickel film obtained by coating drying and calcining the coating liquid onto and on a heat resistant substrate such as made of glass or ceramic is excellent in film strength and surface smoothness and possesses an excellent electroconductivity so that the coating liquid can be utilized as electrodes of various displays such as LCD ELD and PDP and electrodes of circuit boards.

In the present invention nickel formate chemical formula Ni HCOO is present as a nickel compound in an actual form of anhydride Ni HCOO or hydrate Ni HCOO 2HO. By using a nickel film formation coating liquid containing as a solvent an amine based solvent therein having a boiling point between 180 C. inclusive and 300 C. exclusive it becomes possible to readily form a nickel film on a substrate even when an inkjet printing method is adopted as a method for coating the coating liquid onto a substrate.

For carrying out the present invention the present inventors have noticed the facts that a among nickel compounds nickel formate is thermally decomposed in a relatively low temperature range b the solubility of nickel formate in an amine based solvent is notably increased with a temperature raised by heating and c an amine based solvent having a relatively high boiling point is usable for delaying evaporation of the solvent to a certain extent.

Namely in case of adopting a coating liquid for nickel film formation combinedly including an amine based solvent having a higher boiling point 180 to 300 C. and nickel formate having a lower thermal decomposition temperature 240 to 270 C. followed by coating onto a substrate or the like and heating and drying at a high temperature 150 C. or higher the evaporation rate of the amine based solvent volatilization of the amine based solvent is relatively slow even when drying is progressed thereby enabling to increase a solubility of nickel formate in the coating liquid during drying at the temperature raised by heating while restricting evaporation of the amine based solvent volatilization of the amine based solvent to a certain extent.

As such even when the concentration of the nickel formate is increased by heating and drying deposition of nickel formate is hardly caused thereby enabling obtainment of a dried coating film including densely packed nickel formate.

The present invention has been carried out based on such an idea to subject the dried coating film including densely packed nickel formate to additional thermal decomposition by calcining or the like thereby further densifying the obtained nickel film.

Attention should be paid to the points that 1 since a solvent has a certain vapor pressure even at a temperature below its boiling point a solvent is typically and fully volatilized in a coating film at a heating temperature below the boiling point thereby disadvantageously obtaining a dried film and 2 even when a coated liquid is heated to a temperature at or above a boiling point of a solvent the liquid is not raised to a temperature above the boiling point while evaporation is suddenly progressed thereby failing to obtain a uniformly dried film.

The present inventors have taken notice of these points and found out that the decomposition temperature 240 to 270 C. of nickel formate and the boiling point between 180 C. inclusive and 300 C. exclusive of an amine based solvent are important thereby narrowly carrying out the present invention.

As described above the nickel compound used in the present invention is desirably nickel formate since it decomposes at a low temperature about 240 to 270 C. in a neutral atmosphere such as nitrogen argon or the like to form nickel.

Further the content of nickel formate in the coating liquid is preferably within a range of 3 to 40 wt and more preferably 5 to 20 wt . Contents less than 3 wt lead to decreased thicknesses of nickel films to thereby fail to obtain sufficient electroconductivity and contents exceeding 40 wt cause cracks to possibly lose electroconductivity.

Note that the content of nickel formate refers to a content of anhydrous nickel formate Ni HCOO herein.

The solvent to be used in the present invention preferably includes as a main solvent an amine based solvent capable of satisfactorily dissolving nickel formate therein and having a boiling point between 180 C. inclusive and 300 C. exclusive. The amine based solvent as the main solvent is desirably an alkanol amine solvent and or glycol amine solvent which preferably has a hydroxyl group OH at an end of its carbon chain and which is concretely 3 amino 1 propanol boiling point 188 C. . It is also possible to add to 3 amino 1 propanol a small amount of 2 2 aminoethylamino ethanol boiling point 238 to 240 C. 752 mmHg 3 amino 1 2 propanediol boiling point 264 to 265 C. 739 mmHg diethanolamine boiling point 269 C. or the like which are amine based solvents having higher boiling points respectively.

Here nickel formate Ni HCOO has a solubility of as much as about 40 wt even at 25 C. in 3 amino 1 propanol for example and heating the former to about 120 C. causes the solubility to be increased to at least 50 wt such that further heating increases the solubility more. It is thus important that although the amine based solvent to be used in the present invention is to desirably have a solubility equivalent to that of 3 amino 1 propanol it is actually enough for the pertinent amine based solvent to have a higher solubility in a temperature range near the boiling point of the amine based solvent. In other words in a case that an amine based solvent having a low boiling point exemplarily tends to volatilize in the course of temperature elevation during drying of a coating film such that the temperature elevation of the solvent is limited it can be said that the solubility of nickel formate tends to become relatively low in an actual formation process of coating film even when the solubility of nickel formate is high to a certain extent at a low temperature.

Note that all the amine based solvents mentioned above are not classified as deleterious substances respectively.

Further the content of the amine based solvent in the coating liquid for nickel film formation is preferably within a range of 10 to 97 wt and more preferably 15 to 70 wt .

Contents less than 10 wt are undesirable because this deteriorates the effect of the amine based solvent to dissolve therein and to stabilize nickel formate thereby deteriorating the liquid stability of the coating liquid for nickel film formation and simultaneously deteriorating the denseness of the obtained nickel film to deteriorate film characteristics resistance value flatness strength and the like . Only since ethylene glycol has an effect to enhance solubility and stability of nickel formate when the amine based solvent is used combinedly with ethylene glycol as will be described later it becomes possible to exceptionally lower the content of the amine based solvent down to a range of 5 wt to 10 wt or less without deteriorating the liquid stability of the coating liquid for nickel film formation and the characteristics of the nickel film to be obtained. It is desirable to decrease the blending amount of the amine based solvent as less as possible when the coating liquid for nickel film formation is applied to a substrate susceptible to degradation by silicon oxide based alkali as described above.

Meanwhile contents of the amine based solvent exceeding 97 wt are physically impossible because the content of nickel formate is made to be 3 wt or less then. Only as a general tendency excessive contents of the amine based solvent are not so desirable because such contents result in that a wettability is deteriorated depending on a kind of substrate glass for example and b the viscosity of the coating liquid for nickel film formation is increased about 100 mPa s 25 C. for example which is caused by a higher viscosity of the amine based solvent itself thereby exemplarily requiring such an endeavor to adopt an inkjet head having a built in heater upon inkjet printing so as to conduct printing while heating the liquid to lower its viscosity.

Note that since an amine based solvent having a boiling point lower than 180 C. has a higher drying rate the coating liquid adopting such an amine based solvent as a main solvent tends to cause cracks or considerable irregularities of a film as a result of rapid evaporation of the solvent upon drying the coating liquid at a high temperature 180 C. for example after coating it thereby tending to problematically and considerably deteriorate a film resistance value a film strength a film smoothness a film uniformity and the like. Further although the problem of cracks is not caused when the drying temperature is lowered after coating the densification of the film nickel formate then becomes insufficient thereby rather disadvantageously causing problems of film resistance value film strength film smoothness and the like.

In turn an amine based solvent having a boiling point exceeding 300 C. is undesirable since it has an excessively slow drying rate so that the coating liquid adopting it as a main solvent leads to a considerably lengthened drying time upon drying the coating liquid at a high temperature 180 C. for example after coating and simultaneously leads to a tendency of residual solvent in the film. Further even if the drying temperature is raised to enhance the drying rate of the solvent decomposition of nickel formate is rather and simultaneously caused during drying of the coating liquid while causing occurrence of decomposition gases steam carbon dioxide and the like thereby tending to cause problems of considerable deterioration in film resistance value film strength film smoothness film uniformity and the like similarly to the above.

Besides nickel formate and the amine based solvent the coating liquid for nickel film formation to be used in the present invention may contain therein a binder component an organic solvent other than the amine based solvent water and the like as required. Further it is also possible to add thereto a surfactant a high polymer in a small amount for the purpose of further improving the film forming ability of the coating liquid for nickel film formation.

It is enough for the binder to be used in the present invention to dissolve in the amine based solvent in a manner not to deteriorate the dissolution stability of nickel formate and addition of such a binder enables improvement of adhesion force flatness and the like of the film. Examples of such a binder material include a high polymer a silicon based coupling agent a titanium based coupling agent and the like. Among them those coupling agents each having an amino group NH an amine group functional group obtained by substituting one two or three hydrogen atoms of ammonia with one two or three alkyl groups methyl group ethyl group and the like or aryl groups phenyl group and the like or the like are effective since they do not deteriorate the solubility of nickel formate. Examples of the silicon based coupling agent include 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyl methyldimethoxysilane and N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyl dimethylmethoxysilane and examples of the titanium based coupling agent include isopropyl tri N aminoethyl aminoethyl titanate without necessarily limited thereto.

Further the adding amount of the binder is to be 0.05 to 20 parts by weight preferably 1 to 15 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of nickel formate Ni HCOO . Adding amounts less than 0.05 parts by weight fail to exhibit an effect of addition and adding amounts exceeding 20 parts by weight are undesirable because it is then possible to exhibit an effect to improve the adhesion force flatness and the like of the film but the binder component is interposed among nickel fine particles to obstruct contact thereamong thereby deteriorating electroconductivity of the film. Moreover adopting a coupling agent as the binder leads to residue of inorganic component within the film even after calcining in a manner to join nickel fine particles to a substrate thereby contributing to improving an adhesion force of the film. Furthermore addition of the binder also exhibits an effect to uniformalize growth of nickel fine particles during a calcining process thereby also contributing to improving flatness of the film.

Examples of the organic solvent to be used in the present invention other than the amine based solvent are those which are within such a range to have a mutual solubility with the amine based solvent so as not to deteriorate the dissolution stability of nickel formate. Further in case of conducting inkjet printing it is naturally required to restrict a blending amount of a low boiling point solvent boiling point of 100 C. or lower to a smaller amount so as not to deteriorate the printability initial jetting ability intermittent jetting ability and the like .

Namely examples of the organic solvent include alcohol based solvents such as methanol MA ethanol EA 1 propanol NPA isopropanol IPA butanol pentanol benzyl alcohol diacetone alcohol DAA ketone based solvents such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone MEK methyl propyl ketone methyl isobutyl ketone MIBK cyclohexanone isophorone ester based solvents such as ethyl acetate butyl acetate isobutyl acetate amyl formate isoamyl acetate butyl propionate isopropyl butyrate ethyl butyrate butyl butyrate methyl lactate ethyl lactate methyl oxyacetate ethyl oxyacetate butyl oxyacetate methyl methoxyacetate ethyl methoxyacetate butyl methoxyacetate methyl ethoxyacetate ethyl ethoxyacetate methyl 3 oxypropionate ethyl 3 oxypropionate methyl 3 methoxypropionate ethyl 3 methoxypropionate methyl 3 ethoxypropionate ethyl 3 ethoxypropionate methyl 2 oxypropionate ethyl 2 oxypropionate propyl 2 oxypropionate methyl 2 methoxypropionate ethyl 2 methoxypropionate propyl 2 methoxypropionate methyl 2 ethoxypropionate ethyl 2 ethoxypropionate methyl 2 oxy 2 methylpropionate ethyl 2 oxy 2 methylpropionate methyl 2 methoxy 2 methylpropionate ethyl 2 ethoxy 2 methylpropionate methyl pyruvate ethyl pyruvate propyl pyruvate methyl acetoacetate ethyl acetoacetate methyl 2 oxobutanate and ethyl 2 oxobutanate glycol derivatives such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether MCS ethylene glycol monoethyl ether ECS ethylene glycol isopropyl ether IPC ethylene glycol monobutyl ether BCS ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate propylene glycol methyl ether PGM propylene glycol ethyl ether PE propylene glycol methyl ether acetate PGMEA propylene glycol ethyl ether acetate PE AC diethylene glycol monomethyl ether diethylene glycol monoethyl ether diethylene glycol monobutyl ether diethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate diethylene glycol dimethyl ether diethylene glycol diethyl ether diethylene glycol dibutyl ether dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether dipropylene glycol monoethyl ether and dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether amide based solvents such as formamide FA N methyl formamide dimethyl formamide DMF and dimethyl acetamide DMAc benzene derivatives such as toluene xylene mesitylene and dodecyl benzene and dimethylsulfoxide DMSO N methyl 2 pyrrolidone NMP butyrolactone ethylene glycol diethylene glycol tetrahydrofuran THF chloroform mineral spirits and terpineol without necessarily limited thereto. Among the above solvents amide based solvents are desirable in that they keep liquid stability of an amine based solvent. Further such an organic solvent is desirable which has a boiling point lower than that of at least one or more kinds of amine based solvents to be used in the coating liquid for nickel film formation because the organic solvent volatilizes prior to the amine based solvents so that the amine based solvents satisfactorily dissolving nickel formate therein volatilize thereafter. Among the amide based solvents dimethyl acetamide boiling point 166 C. surface tension 32.4 dyn cm 30 C. viscosity 0.92 mPa s 25 C. is preferable in that its boiling point is appropriately high and its surface tension and viscosity are low.

Here examples of preferable solvents include dialkylene glycol monoalkyl ethers alkylene ethylene and propylene and alkyl methyl and ethyl because which exemplarily embrace diethylene glycol monomethyl ether boiling point 194 C. surface tension 34.8 dyn cm 25 C. viscosity 3.48 mPa s 25 C. diethylene glycol monoethyl ether boiling point 202 C. surface tension 31.8 dyn cm 25 C. viscosity 3.71 mPa s 25 C. diethylene glycol monopropyl ether boiling point 210 C. surface tension 32.3 dyn cm 20 C. viscosity 4.1 mPa s 25 C. dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether boiling point 190 C. surface tension 28.8 dyn cm 25 C. viscosity 3.33 mPa s 25 C. and dipropylene glycol monoethyl ether boiling point 198 C. surface tension 27.7 dyn cm 25 C. viscosity 3.34 mPa s 25 C. because which each have a boiling point slightly higher than the boiling point of 188 C. of the above mentioned 3 amino 1 propanol as the amine based solvent and a surface tension and a viscosity lower than those of the amine based solvent and because which each provide a coating liquid having a low viscosity and being excellent in film forming ability when used combinedly with the 3 amino 1 propanol though the exact reason thereof is unknown.

Further examples of preferable solvents also include ethylene glycol boiling point 197.6 C. surface tension 48.4 dyn cm 20 C. viscosity 20.9 mPa s 20 C. because although ethylene glycol has a boiling point slightly higher than the boiling point 188 C. of the above described 3 amino 1 propanol as the amine based solvent ethylene glycol has a capability of assisting nickel formate in dissolution so that blending ethylene glycol in the coating liquid for nickel film formation enables to ensure the dissolution stability of nickel formate even with a decreased blending amount of the 3 amino 1 propanol. Only the viscosity of ethylene glycol is as slightly high as about 21 mPa s such that combined usage of ethylene glycol with the above described low viscosity dialkylene glycol monoalkyl ether alkylene ethylene propylene and alkyl methyl ethyl enables obtainment of a coating liquid nickel formate 5 to 10 wt amine based solvent 5 to 10 wt ethylene glycol 5 to 15 wt dialkylene glycol monoalkyl ether 65 to 75 wt and others small amounts which is less in blending amount of amine based solvent low in viscosity and excellent in film forming ability.

Glycol solvents other than ethylene glycol such as diethylene glycol triethylene glycol tetraethylene glycol propylene glycol dipropylene glycol tripropylene glycol and the like exhibit substantially no capabilities to assist nickel formate in dissolution and only ethylene glycol has a unique capability.

Here although water as a solvent other than an amine based solvent is necessarily contained in the coating liquid for nickel film formation when nickel formate hydrate Ni COOH 2HO is used as a source material of nickel formate also water has a capability to enhance solubility and stability of nickel formate at a degree lower than ethylene glycol so that further addition of water is allowed such that the content of water in the coating liquid for nickel film formation is 25 wt or less preferably 20 wt or less . Contents of water exceeding 25 wt are undesirably tend to deteriorate dissolution stability of nickel formate though the reason thereof is unknown.

The coating liquid which blendedly includes therein the amine based solvent dialkylene glycol monoalkyl ether alkylene ethylene and propylene and alkyl methyl ethyl and propyl ethylene glycol water and the like and which is low in viscosity and excellent in film forming ability is suitable for various coating methods such as spin coating and particularly optimum for inkjet printing.

Examples of the surfactant and high polymer utilizable in the present invention include silicone based fluorine based and amine based surfactants acrylic high polymers which are desirably combustible or thermally decomposable if possible. Examples of the silicone based surfactants include one having a hydrophobic group constituted of dimethylpolysiloxane and a hydrophilic group constituted of polyalkyleneoxide and one including various functional groups introduced into parts thereof which each have an HLB hydrophile lipophile balance value of 10 to 20. HLB values less than 10 lead to a tendency of insufficient uniformity of a film obtained by coating and film formation of the coating liquid for nickel film formation and are thus undesirable. Typically silicone based surfactants having HLB values exceeding 20 are not commercially available and it is difficult to obtain them.

Here the HLB hydrophile lipophile balance value is a kind of index representing a nature of a surfactant such that the HLB value represents a balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity in a manner that higher HLB values represent more water soluble and lower HLB values approach more oil soluble.

As the above described functional groups amino groups and amine groups are desirable from a standpoint to improve a solubility of the surfactant in the amine based solvent and the dissolution stability of nickel formate. Here examples of the amine based surfactant preferably include alkylamine acetate RHNH.HOOCCH R alkyl group since it excellently keeps liquid stability of the coating liquid for nickel film formation and it is also thermally decomposable.

The surfactant and high polymer are each desirably added in an amount of 0.01 to 3.0 parts by weight preferably 0.02 to 0.5 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of nickel formate Ni HCOO . This is because amounts less than 0.01 parts by weight fail to exhibit an effect of addition and amounts exceeding 3.0 parts by weight enable exhibition of the effect to improve the film forming ability but the surfactant or high polymer component is interposed among nickel fine particles in the course of nickel film formation to obstruct particle growth and particle contact thereby possibly and undesirably deteriorating electroconductivity of the obtained nickel film.

The coating liquid for nickel film formation to be used in the present invention can be prepared by heatingly dissolving nickel formate in an amine based solvent. Further it is possible to add thereto a binder component the above described organic solvent and the like as required as described above. The condition of the heating dissolution is such that stirring is conducted for about 10 to 60 minutes when the heating dissolution temperature is set at 50 to 160 C. for example. Heating dissolution temperatures below 50 C. are inefficient though dissolution can be narrowly achieved by an elapse of long time and heating dissolution temperatures higher than 160 C. undesirably lead to considerable evaporation of the amine based solvent to change the nickel formate concentration. Further the nickel film of the present invention can be produced by coating and drying the coating liquid for nickel film formation onto and on a substrate followed by calcining.

Examples of coating methods utilizable in the present invention include various ones such as spin coating wirebar coating dip coating screen printing inkjet printing and among them the coating method based on inkjet printing is desirable in that it is capable of directly forming a fine pattern with an excellent resolution.

Since inkjet printing is configured to jet an ink from a nozzle onto a substrate to thereby form a coating film pattern thereon the viscosity value measured at room temperature of the coating liquid is usually required to be set in a range of about 5 to 30 mPa s preferably 5 to 20 mPa s more preferably 5 to 15 mPa s . Since this proper viscosity refers to the viscosity of ink within an inkjet head it is possible to adopt an ink having a higher viscosity which means a viscosity at room temperature in an apparatus having a built in heater in an inkjet head. Further in order to avoid clogging at a nozzle portion due to dryout of a solvent it is required to use a solvent having a relatively high boiling point for example boiling point 100 C. or higher .

Based on the above reasons drying of the coating liquid for nickel film formation coated on the substrate is to be conducted at a temperature of 150 C. preferably 150 to 220 C. and more preferably 180 to 220 C. for the substrate having the coating liquid coated thereon. Only drying can be conducted even below 150 C. depending on the conditions to obtain an excellent nickel film. Drying is to be preferably kept for a time of 10 to 60 minutes. Usable as a drying atmosphere is a neutral atmosphere such as atmospheric air or nitrogen gas.

Calcining is conducted by introducing the coated substrate after drying into a calcining furnace typically followed by heating at about 240 C. or higher which is a decomposition temperature of nickel formate desirably 300 C. or higher for 30 to 120 minutes. The decomposition temperature of nickel formate can be lowered by adding a small amount about 0.01 to 0.1 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of nickel of a thermal decomposition promoter such as a palladium compound palladium acetate for example into the coating liquid for nickel film formation thereby enabling the calcining temperature to be further lowered by about 5 to 15 C. Only depending on the kind and adding amount of the thermal decomposition promoter fine particles may be caused due to a decomposition promoting function of the promoter when the standing time of the coating liquid at the room temperature is extended and it is thus necessary in this case to blend the thermal decomposition promoter into the coating liquid for nickel film formation just prior to usage thereof.

Higher calcining temperatures lead to an improved electroconductivity of a nickel film since particle growth of nickel particles are promoted then. Although the calcining atmosphere may be a neutral atmosphere such as nitrogen gas argon gas or the like reducing atmospheres such as hydrogen gas hydrogen nitrogen mixed gas and the like are desirable in that they are each capable of completely restricting oxidation of nickel particles to promote sintering among nickel particles themselves thereby further improving electroconductivity. Further calcining in a reducing atmosphere enables reduction of nickel formate into nickel even at a temperature at or below the decomposition temperature of nickel formate thereby enabling obtainment of a nickel film by calcining even at a low temperature of about 200 to 230 C. for example though the calcining time is extended then.
