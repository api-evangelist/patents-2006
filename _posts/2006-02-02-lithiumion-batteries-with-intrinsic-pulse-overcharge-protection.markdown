This present invention relates in general to the field of lithium rechargeable batteries and more particularly relates to the positive electrode design of lithium ion batteries with improved high rate pulse overcharge protection.

Currently many consumer electronics are powered by lithium ion batteries the safety of which is a big concern to both the consumers and the manufacturers. A reliable battery must survive several abuse conditions including overcharge. Overcharge generally occurs when a current is forced through a lithium ion battery and the charge delivered exceeds the charge storing capability of the battery. Overcharge of lithium ion batteries can trigger chemical and electrochemical reactions of battery components rapid temperature elevation and can even trigger self accelerating reactions leading up to and including explosion of the battery.

In current lithium ion battery technology several overcharge protection mechanisms are typically added to ensure the safety of the batteries during overcharging conditions. For instance a chemical compound known as a redox shuttle additive may be incorporated into the battery electrolyte to provide intrinsic overcharge protection. Generally the redox shuttle can be reversibly electrochemically oxidized and reduced at a potential slightly higher than the working potential of the positive electrode of the battery. With the incorporation of a redox shuttle into the electrolyte lithium ion batteries can normally operate in a voltage range below the redox potential of the redox shuttle. If the battery is overcharged the battery voltage will meet the redox potential of the additive first and activate the redox mechanism of the redox shuttle. In general when the overcharge current is lower than the shuttle capability of the additive the redox shuttle will be the only active component to transfer the excessive charge through the battery without causing any damage to the battery. Under such mechanisms the dangerous voltage of the battery is never reached even if the battery is overcharged.

While redox shuttles provide some protection of a lithium ion battery no redox shuttle can provide unlimited overcharge protection. The main barrier is the maximum shuttle current the redox shuttle can provide which determines the maximum overcharge current that a battery with a redox shuttle can sustain. The maximum shuttle current is physically limited by the solubility of the redox shuttle in non aqueous electrolytes the diffusion coefficient of the redox shuttle in the non aqueous electrolytes the charge transfer constant of the redox shuttle on the electrode surface and battery geometry. Generally redox shuttles described in the literature have very limited solubility in the non aqueous electrolytes and can only provide low rate overcharge protection. Once the overcharge current exceeds the maximum shuttle current of the redox shuttle the battery will be driven to higher voltages that trigger dangerous reactions in the battery.

Recently lithium ion batteries have been proposed as the power source for hybrid electric vehicles HEV . During braking of a HEV the excessive energy from the engine is stored in the lithium ion battery. A high rate pulse current which can be up to a 10 C rate will be forced through the battery to meet the high power output of the engine. In this situation those lithium ion cells already at their maximum charge capacity will be overcharged with a very high current up to 10 C . It remains a huge challenge to design a redox shuttle to provide such high shuttle current. Because state of the art redox shuttles alone cannot provide such high rate continuous overcharge protection there remains a need in the art to meet the challenge of high rate pulse overcharge can for lithium ion batteries.

In one aspect the present invention provides a new design of positive electrodes for lithium ion batteries that dramatically boosts the pulse overcharge protection capability of the redox shuttle added to the batteries. More specifically the present design allocates a small portion of capacity in the cathode beyond the redox potential of the redox shuttle. The extra capacity will not be accessed during normal battery operation and low rate overcharge but acts as the charge buffer to store the extra charge that cannot be handled by the redox shuttle during a pulse. In further aspects there are provided methods of making and using batteries using such overcharge protection systems.

The present invention relates to the design of cathode electrodes to enhance the pulse overcharge protection of redox shuttles for lithium ion batteries. More generally it is related to the design of lithium ion batteries incorporating redox shuttles that are tolerant to high rate pulse overcharge. Lithium ion batteries containing electrodes and electrolytes of the present invention may be used in applications such as the hybrid electric vehicles HEV and other high power battery applications.

Generally a successful redox shuttle is required to have a redox potential 0.2 0.3 V higher than the working potential of the positive electrode of a lithium ion battery. This will minimize the self discharge of the battery induced by the shuttle mechanism of the redox shuttle. This design is generally applicable to high energy lithium ion batteries that are subjected to charging and discharging at low rate currents. The redox shuttle incorporated in the battery is enough to handle the low rate current and the potential of the positive electrode will never go beyond the redox potential of the redox shuttle. Therefore at low rate charging and discharging currents any capacity residues at potentials higher than the redox potential will never be exploited and are considered to be inactive material.

However the design described above is significantly challenged for high power lithium ion batteries. In general cases the current for power applications is beyond the physical limitations of a redox shuttle. Once the battery is overcharged the potential of the positive electrode will dynamically be driven to a potential higher than the redox potential of the redox shuttle and this effect increases dramatically with the current applied. The design of the present invention is to incorporate a charge buffer in the positive electrode to improve the pulse overcharge tolerance of the battery. The charge buffer of the present invention may be any positive electrode material that can deliver extra capacity at a potential range higher than the redox potential of the redox shuttle. When a low rate current is applied the redox shuttle can work properly and keep the cell potential under the redox potential of the redox shuttle. In this case the charge buffer will not be activated. When a high rate pulse current is applied beyond the capability of the redox shuttle the capacity of the charge buffer will be accessed. During pulse overcharging the charge buffer will be charged and will store the extra charge that cannot be shuttled by the redox shuttle. When the pulse is over the charge buffer will be discharged with the aid of the redox shuttle through self discharge and an empty charge buffer is then regenerated for next pulse overcharge. With the special design of the charge buffer the pulse overcharge protection of the battery can be significantly improved regardless of the charge carrying capability of the redox shuttle.

In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there are provided electrochemical devices that include a cathode comprising at least one primary positive material and at least one secondary positive material i.e. the charge buffer an anode and a non aqueous electrolyte comprising a redox shuttle additive. The redox shuttle has a redox potential that is greater than the redox potential of the primary positive material but less than the redox potential of the secondary positive material. The redox shuttle additive is also stable at least up to the redox potential of the secondary positive material. By stable it is meant that the redox shuttle additive does not decompose at the working potential or overcharge potential of the device and does not decompose to or otherwise form a passivation film on either the cathode or the anode.

Redox shuttle additives of the present invention capable of being oxidized and reduced in the non aqueous electrolyte may typically be either a substituted or unsubstituted ferrocene compound such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 857 423 or a substituted aromatic compound. The substituted aromatic compounds suitable for use in the present invention may generally be of formula I 

In other embodiments of the present invention the concentration of the redox shuttle additive ranges from about 0.0005 weight percent wt to about 50 wt and more typically from about 0.0005 wt to about 10 wt . In some cases where LiBXor LiBX each X is independently selected from the group consisting of H F Cl Br I OCH and OH are employed they can also be used as the alkali metal salt of the electrolyte. The concentration of such borate heteroborate salts ranges from 0.01 M to 0.6 M preferably from 0.1 M to 0.5 M more preferably from 0.3 M to 0.4 M.

In other embodiments of the present invention the redox shuttle additive has a redox potential v. Liof from about 3.0V to about 5.0V in other embodiments from about 3.6V to about 4.8V and in yet other embodiments from about 4.2V and about 4.4V.

Electrolytes of the invention include an alkali metal salt dissolved in a polar aprotic solvent and are non aqueous i.e. contain either no water or almost no water e.g. 100 ppm water . The alkali metal salt is typically present at a concentration of from about 0.5 to about 2 molar and is typically a lithium salt. Exemplary lithium salts include Li B CO Li BF CO Li PF CO LiClO LiBF LiAsF LiPF LiCFSO Li N CFSO Li C CFSO Li N SOCF LiBXor LiBXwhere each X is independently selected from the group consisting of H F Cl Br I OCH and OH lithium alkyl fluorophosphates or a mixture of any two or more thereof. Lithium decaborates LiBX and lithium dodecaborates LiBX may be used as either the alkali metal salt in the electrolyte or as the redox shuttle additive of the device or in the dual role as both.

Suitable polar aprotic solvents for use in non aqueous electrolytes are known in the art and include for example ethyl acetate propyl acetate ethylene carbonate propylene carbonate dimethyl carbonate diethyl carbonate ethyl methyl carbonate dimethyl ether diethyl ether methyl acetate gamma butyrolactone sulfolane or a mixture of any two or more thereof. Protic solvents such as water and alcohols cannot be used with the present invention.

Cathodes of the invention comprise primary and secondary positive material that may be the same or different. In some embodiments the positive electrode is a blend of two or more different positive electrode materials. At least one of the materials is the primary material that works properly below the redox potential of the redox shuttle and at least one of the materials is added as the charge buffer. In certain cases positive electrode materials can act as both the primary material and as the charge buffer particularly in cases where the material exhibits different voltage potentials at zero charge and at full charge. In some such embodiments the positive material can be LiMnNiCoO wherein 0 x 1 0 y 1 0 x y 1. For instance LiMnNiCoOwith 10 excess lithium delivers capacity in a wide potential range from about 3.7 V to about 4.6 V vs. Li. Therefore any positive electrodes containing materials such as LiMnNiCoOwith 10 excess lithium may fulfill the design described in the present invention.

Cathodes in devices of the present invention may have a primary positive material that is a lithium metal oxide cathode or a mixture of two or more lithium metal oxide cathodes and a secondary positive material that is a lithium metal oxide cathode or a mixture of two or more lithium metal oxide cathodes. In some embodiments of the present invention the primary positive material may be LiFePO. In other embodiments the secondary positive material is spinel LiMnO LiCoO LiCo Al O or LiMnNiCoO wherein 0 0.2 0 x 1 0 y 1 0 x y 1.

The cathode in an invention electrochemical device may have a primary positive material selected from a group comprising LiS spinel olivine carbon coated olivine LiFePO LiCoO LiNiO LiNiCoMetO LiMnNiO LiMnCoNiO LiMnO LiFeO LiMetMnO LiNiMnCoMet OY AB XO NASICON LiMnO or mixtures of any two or more thereof where Met is Al Mg Ti B Ga Si Mn or Co Met is Mg Zn Al Ga B Zr or Ti A is Li Ag Cu Na Mn Fe Co Ni Cu or Zn B is Ti V Cr Fe or Zr X is P S Si W or Mo Y is F or S and 0 x 0.3 0 y 0.5 0 z 0.5 and 0 x 0.4 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0.4 and 0 z 0.4 and 0 n 3. In other embodiments the primary positive material may be a spinel manganese oxide of formula LiMnMetOX where Met is Al Mg Ti B Ga Si Ni or Co X is S or F and where 0 x 0.3 0 y 0.5 0 z 0.5 0 m 0.5 and 0 n 0.5 or a olivine of formula LiFeMet POX where Met is Al Mg Ti B Ga Si Ni Mn or Co X is S or F and wherein 0 y 0.5 0 z 0.5 0 m 0.5 and 0 n 0.5. In yet other embodiments the primary positive material is LiMnMetOX LiFeMetPOX or mixtures of any two or more thereof wherein Met is Al Mg Ti B Ga Si Ni or Co X is S or F and wherein 0 x 0.3 0 y 0.5 0 z 0.5 0 m 0.5 and 0 n 0.5.

Primary positive materials of the invention may be surface coated to minimize degradation of the cathode under normal operating conditions. For example spinel or olivine particles may be surface coated with a material that can neutralize acid or otherwise lessen or prevent leaching of the manganese or iron ions. Thus inventive cathodes may comprise a surface coating of a metal oxide on the spinel or olivine particles such as ZrO TiO ZnO WO AlO MgO SiO SnOAlPO Al OH a mixture of any two or more thereof or any other suitable metal oxide. The coating can also be applied to a carbon coated olivine. Where carbon coated olivine is used the metal oxide coating can be applied to the carbon coated olivine or it can be applied to the olivine followed by carbon coating of the metal oxide film.

In some embodiments the secondary positive material is spinel olivine carbon coated olivine LiFePO LiCoO LiNiO LiNiCoMetO LiMnNiO LiMnCoNiO LiMnO LiFeO LiMetMnO LiNiMnCoMet OY AB XO or mixtures of any two or more thereof wherein Met is Al Mg Ti B Ga Si Mn or Co Met is Mg Zn Al Ga B Zr or Ti A is Li Ag Cu Na Mn Fe Co Ni Cu and Zn B is Ti V Cr Fe and Zr X is P S Si W Mo Y is F or S 0 x 0.3 0 y 0.5 0 z 0.5 0 x 0.4 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0.4 and 0 z 0.4 and 0 n 3. In other embodiments the secondary positive material may be a spinel manganese oxide with the formula of LiMnMetOX wherein Met is Al Mg Ti B Ga Si Ni or Co X is S or F and wherein 0 x 0.3 0 y 0.5 0 z 0.5 0 m 0.5 and 0 n 0.5 or the cathode may comprise olivine with a formula of LiFeMet POX wherein Met is Al Mg Ti B Ga Si Ni Mn or Co X is S or F and wherein 0 y 0.5 0 z 0.5 0 m 0.5 and 0 n 0.5. In other embodiments the secondary positive material may be LiMnNiCoO wherein 0 x 1 0 y 1 0 x y 1.

In a manner analogous to the stabilization of the primary positive electrode material the secondary positive electrode material may also be stabilized by surface coating the spinel or olivine with a protective metal oxide coating. For example the secondary positive material may comprise a surface coating of a metal oxide on the spinel or olivine particles such as ZrO TiO ZnO WO AlO MgO SiO SnOAlPO Al OH a mixture of any two or more thereof or any other suitable metal oxide. The coating may also be applied to a carbon coated olivine. Where carbon coated olivine is used the metal oxide coating may be applied to the carbon coated olivine or may be applied to the olivine first followed by carbon coating of the metal oxide film. Methods for coating spinel cathodes with metal oxides are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 2004 0191633 A1 and may readily be adapted for use with olivine cathodes.

Table 1 illustrative of the present invention shows non limiting examples of combinations of primary positive and secondary positive materials and various redox shuttle additives that may be appropriate for the chosen pair s of positive materials. Table 1 is by no means an exhaustive listing of combinations but particularly illustrates the relationship between the redox potentials of the three types of components. Thus for example the redox potential of the secondary positive material can range from about 0.01 to about 1 V higher than the redox potential of the primary positive material. In some embodiments the difference between the primary and secondary materials ranges from about 0.2 to about 0.4 0.6 or 0.8 V. In still other embodiments the redox potential difference ranges from about 0.4 to about 0.6 or 0.8 V.

As demonstrated herein the charge buffer significantly enhances the pulse overcharge protection capability of the redox shuttle. For instance 2 5 di tert butyl 1 4 dimethoxybenzene has a redox potential of 3.9 V vs. Liand is a stable redox shuttle for LiFePOpositive electrodes which have a working potential of about 3.5 V vs. Li. Spinel which delivers capacity at 4.0 4.2 V vs. Li may be used as the charge buffer for LiFePOand may dramatically boost the pulse overcharge protection capability of 2 5 di tert butyl 1 4 dimethoxybenzene. Successful charge buffers are not limited to spinel materials. Any positive electrode material that delivers capacity at potentials higher than 3.9V vs. Li e.g. LiCoO LiCoAlO LiMnNiCoO etc. wherein 0 0.2 0 x 1 0 y 1 0 x y 1 can be an excellent charge buffers for batteries incorporating 2 5 di tert butyl 1 4 dimethoxybenzene as the redox shuttle.

Another example of a redox shuttle for 4V class positive electrode materials is tetrafluorobenzo 1 2 dioxyl pentafluorophenylborane. This redox shuttle has a redox potential of about 4.4 V vs. Li and is suitable to protect 4 V class positive electrodes from overcharging. In this example materials that deliver capacity above 4.4 V vs. Limay be used as a charge buffer. In one instance the charge buffer may be Li MnNiCo O which can deliver capacity up to 4.6 V vs. Li 0 0.2.

In some embodiments the positive electrode is a blend of two or more different positive electrode materials. At least one of the materials is the primary material that works properly below the redox potential of the redox shuttle and at least one of the materials is added as the charge buffer. In certain cases positive electrode materials can act as both the primary material and as the charge buffer particularly in cases where the material exhibits different voltage potentials at zero charge and at full charge. In some embodiments the positive material is LiMnNiCoO wherein 0 x 1 0 y 1 0 x y 1. For instance LiMnNiCoOwith 10 excess lithium delivers capacity in a wide potential range from about 3.7 V to about 4.6 V vs. Li. Therefore any positive electrodes containing materials such as LiMnNiCoOwith 10 excess lithium may fulfill the design described in the present invention.

Alternatively the redox shuttle additive does not decompose at the working potential of the device or at the overcharge potential of the device.
