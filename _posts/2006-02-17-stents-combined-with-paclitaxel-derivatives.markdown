title: Stents combined with paclitaxel derivatives
abstract: Stents are used in combination with a paclitaxel derivative in order to inhibit scarring that may otherwise occur when the implant is placed within an animal. Suitable implants include vascular stents, esophageal stents, tracheal or bronchial stents, gastrointestinal stents, genital-urinary stents, nasal and sinus stents, and ENT stents.

This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 653 844 filed Feb. 17 2005 which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates generally to pharmaceutical compositions that include paclitaxel derivatives and methods for preparing and using stent devices to make them resistant to overgrowth by inflammatory and fibrous scar tissue.

The clinical function of numerous medical implants and devices is dependent upon the device being able to effectively maintain an anatomical or surgically created space or passageway. Unfortunately many devices implanted in the body are subject to a foreign body response from the surrounding host tissues. In particular injury to tubular anatomical structures such as blood vessels the gastrointestinal tract the male and female reproductive tract the urinary tract sinuses spinal nerve root canals lacrimal ducts Eustachian tubes the auditory canal and the respiratory tract from surgery and or injury created by the implantation of medical devices can lead to a well known clinical problem called stenosis or narrowing . Stenosis occurs in response to trauma to the epithelial lining or the entire body tube during the procedure including virtually any manipulation which attempts to relieve obstruction of the passageway and is a major factor limiting the effectiveness of invasive treatments for a variety of diseases to be described later.

Stenosis or restenosis if the problem recurs after an initially successful attempt to open a blocked passageway is a form of response to injury leading to wall thickening narrowing of the lumen and loss of function in the tissue supplied by the particular passageway. Physical injury during an interventional procedure results in damage to epithelial lining of the tube and the smooth muscle cells SMCs that make up the wall. The damaged cells particularly SMCs release cytokines which recruit inflammatory cells such as macrophages lymphocytes and neutrophils i.e. which are some of the known white blood cells into the area. The white blood cells in turn release a variety of additional cytokines growth factors and tissue degrading enzymes that influence the behavior of the constituent cells of the wall primarily epithelial cells and SMCs . Stimulation of the SMCs induces them to migrate into the inner aspect of the body passageway often called the intima proliferate and secrete an extracellar matrix effectively filling all or parts of the lumen with reactive fibrous scar tissue. Collectively this creates a thickening of the intimal layer known in some tissues as neointimal hyperplasia that narrows the lumen of the passageway and can be significant enough to obstruct its lumen.

Briefly stated in one aspect the present invention provides medical devices e.g. stents that are coated or otherwise contain paclitaxel derivatives or compositions comprising paclitaxel derivatives methods for making such devices methods for inhibiting fibrosis comprising placing medical devices that are coated with or otherwise contain paclitaxel derivatives or compositions comprising paclitaxel derivatives and methods for inhibiting fibrosis comprising separately placing a medical device and applying at least one of i a paclitaxel derivative and ii a composition that comprises a paclitaxel derivative into an animal. Paclitaxel derivatives or compositions comprising paclitaxel derivatives are delivered in therapeutic levels over a period sufficient to allow normal healing to occur at or near the site where a medical device is implanted. For example within one aspect of the invention paclitaxel derivate coated or paclitaxel derivate impregnated medical devices are provided that reduce fibrosis in the tissue surrounding the devices or inhibit scar development on the device surface.

The repair of tissues following a mechanical or surgical intervention involves two distinct processes 1 regeneration the replacement of injured cells by cells of the same type and 2 fibrosis the replacement of injured cells by connective tissue . There are four general components to the process of fibrosis or scarring including formation of new blood vessels angiogenesis migration and proliferation of connective tissue cells such as fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells deposition of extracellular matrix ECM and remodeling maturation and organization of the fibrous tissue . Within one embodiment of the invention a device is adapted to release a paclitaxel derivative that inhibits fibrosis or regeneration through one or more of the mechanisms sited herein.

In one aspect the present invention provide a device comprising a stent and a paclitaxel derivative or a composition comprising a paclitaxel derivative wherein the paclitaxel derivative inhibits scarring between the device and a host into which the device is implanted.

These and other aspects of the present invention will become evident upon reference to the following detailed description and attached drawings. In addition various references are set forth herein which describe in more detail certain procedures and or compositions e.g. polymers and are therefore incorporated by reference in the entirety.

Prior to setting forth the invention it may be helpful to an understanding thereof to first set forth definitions of certain terms that are used herein.

 Fibrosis Scarring or Fibrotic Response refers to the formation of fibrous tissue in response to injury or medical intervention. Therapeutic agents which inhibit fibrosis or scarring e.g. paclitaxel derivatives are those agents inhibit fibrosis through one or more mechanisms including inhibiting angiogenesis inhibiting migration or proliferation of connective tissue cells such as fibroblasts smooth muscle cells vascular smooth muscle cells reducing ECM production and or inhibiting tissue remodeling.

 Host Person Subject Patient and the like are used synonymously to refer to the living being into which a device of the present invention is implanted.

 Implanted refers to having completely or partially placed a device within a host. A device is partially implanted when some of the device reaches or extends to the outside of a host.

 Inhibit fibrosis reduce fibrosis and the like are used synonymously to refer to the action of agents or compositions which result in a statistically significant decrease in the formation of fibrous tissue that can be expected to occur in the absence of the agent or composition.

 Medical device implant medical device or implant Implant device and the like are used synonymously to refer to any object that is designed to be placed partially or wholly within a patient s body for one or more therapeutic or prophylactic purposes such as for restoring physiological function alleviating symptoms associated with disease delivering therapeutic agents and or repairing or replacing or augmenting etc. damaged or diseased organs and tissues. While normally composed of biologically compatible synthetic materials e.g. medical grade stainless steel titanium and other metals polymers such as polyurethane silicon PLA PLGA and other materials that are exogenous some medical devices and implants include materials derived from animals e.g. xenografts such as whole animal organs animal tissues such as heart valves naturally occurring or chemically modified molecules such as collagen hyaluronic acid proteins carbohydrates and others human donors e.g. allografts such as whole organs tissues such as bone grafts skin grafts and others or from the patients themselves e.g. autografts such as saphenous vein grafts skin grafts tendon ligament muscle transplants . Medical devices of particular utility in the present invention include but are not restricted to vascular stents gastrointestinal stents tracheal bronchial stents genital urinary stents and ENT stents.

 Release of an agent refers to a statistically significant presence of the agent or a subcomponent thereof which has disassociated from the implant device.

 Biodegradable refers to materials for which the degradation process is at least partially mediated by and or performed in a biological system. Degradation refers to a chain scission process by which a polymer chain is cleaved into oligomers and monomers. Chain scission may occur through various mechanisms including for example by chemical reaction e.g. hydrolysis or by a thermal or photolytic process. Polymer degradation may be characterized for example using gel permeation chromatography GPC which monitors the polymer molecular mass changes during erosion and drug release. Biodegradable also refers to materials may be degraded by an erosion process mediated by and or performed in a biological system. Erosion refers to a process in which material is lost from the bulk. In the case of a polymeric system the material may be a monomer an oligomer a part of a polymer backbone or a part of the polymer bulk. Erosion includes i surface erosion in which erosion affects only the surface and not the inner parts of a matrix and ii bulk erosion in which the entire system is rapidly hydrated and polymer chains are cleaved throughout the matrix. Depending on the type of polymer erosion generally occurs by one of three basic mechanisms see e.g. Heller J. 1984 1 1 Siepmann J. et al. 2001 48 1 water soluble polymers that have been insolubilized by covalent cross links and that solubilize as the cross links or the backbone undergo a hydrolytic cleavage 2 polymers that are initially water insoluble are solubilized by hydrolysis ionization or pronation of a pendant group and 3 hydrophobic polymers are converted to small water soluble molecules by backbone cleavage. Techniques for characterizing erosion include thermal analysis e.g. DSC X ray diffraction scanning electron microscopy SEM electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy EPR NMR imaging and recording mass loss during an erosion experiment. For microspheres photon correlation spectroscopy PCS and other particles size measurement techniques may be applied to monitor the size evolution of erodible devices versus time.

 Body passageway as used herein refers to any of number of passageways tubes pipes tracts canals sinuses or conduits which have an inner lumen and allow the flow of materials within the body. Representative examples of body passageways include arteries and veins lacrimal ducts the trachea bronchi bronchiole nasal passages including the sinuses and other airways eustachian tubes the external auditory canal the esophagus the stomach the duodenum the small intestine the large intestine biliary tracts the ureter the bladder the urethra the fallopian tubes uterus vagina and other passageways of the female reproductive tract the vas deferens and other passageways of the male reproductive tract.

Any concentration ranges percentage range or ratio range recited herein are to be understood to include concentrations percentages or ratios of any integer within that range and fractions thereof such as one tenth and one hundredth of an integer unless otherwise indicated. Also any number range recited herein relating to any physical feature such as polymer subunits size or thickness are to be understood to include any integer within the recited range unless otherwise indicated. It should be understood that the terms a and an as used above and elsewhere herein refer to one or more of the enumerated components. For example a polymer refers to both one polymer and a mixture comprising two or more polymers. As used herein the term about means 15 .

Representative examples genital urinary GU stents that can benefit from being coated with or having incorporated therein a paclitaxel derivative include ureteric and urethral stents fallopian tube stents prostate stents including metallic and polymeric GU stents and GU stents that have an external covering e.g. polyurethane poly ethylene terephthalate PTFE or silicone rubber .

In one aspect genital urinary stents include ureteric and urethral stents. Ureteral stents are hollow tubes with holes along the sides and coils at either end to prevent migration. Ureteral stents are used to relieve obstructions caused by stones or malignancy to facilitate the passage of stones or to allow healing of ureteral anastomoses or leaks following surgery or trauma. They are placed endoscopically via the bladder or percutaneously via the kidney.

Urethral stents are used for the treatment of recurrent urethral strictures detruso external sphincter dyssynergia and bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hypertrophy. In addition procedures that are conducted for the prostate such as external radiation or brachytherapy may lead to fibrosis due to tissue insult resulting from these procedures. The incidence of urethral stricture in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiation is about 2 . Development of urethral stricture may also occur in other conditions such as following urinary catheterization or surgery which results in damage to the epithelium of the urethra. The clinical manifestation of urinary tract obstruction includes decreased force and caliber of the urinary stream intermittency postvoid dribbling hesitance and nocturia. Complete closure of the urethra can result in numerous problems including eventual kidney failure. To maintain patency in the urethra urethral stents may be used. The stents are typically self expanding and composed of metal superalloy titanium stainless steel or polyurethane.

For example the ureteric urethral stent may be composed of a main catheter body of flexible polymeric material having an enlarged entry end with a hydrophilic tip that dissolves when contacted with body fluids. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 401 257. The ureteric urethral stent may be composed of a multi sections including a closed section at that the bladder end which does not contain any fluid passageways such that it acts as an anti reflux device to prevent reflux of urine back into the kidney. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 647 843. The ureteric urethral stent may be composed of a central catheter tube made of shape memory material that forms a stent with a retention coil for anchoring to the ureter. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 681 274. The ureteric urethral stent may be a composed of an elongated flexible tubular stent with preformed set curls at both ends and an elongated tubular rigid extension attached to the distal end which allows the combination function as an externalized ureteral catheter. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 221 253 and 5 116 309. The ureteric urethral stent may be composed of an elongated member a proximal retention structure and a resilient portion connecting them together whereby they are all in fluid communication with each other with a slideable portion providing a retracted and expanded position. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 685 744. The ureteric urethral stent may be a hollow cylindrical tube that has a flexible connecting means and locating means that expands and selectively contracts. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 322 501. The ureteric urethral stent may be composed of a stiff polymeric body that affords superior columnar and axial strength for advancement into the ureter and a softer bladder coil portion for reducing the risk of irritation. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 141 502. The ureteric urethral stent may be composed of an elongated tubular segment that has a pliable wall at the proximal region and a plurality of members that prevent blockage of fluid drainage upon compression. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 676 623. The ureteric urethral stent may be a catheter composed of a conduit which is part of an assembly that allows for non contaminated insertion into a urinary canal by providing a sealing member that surrounds the catheter during dismantling. See e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0060807A1.

In another aspect genital urinary stents include prostatic stents. For example the prostatic stent may be composed of two polymeric rings constructed of tubing with a plurality of connecting arm members connecting the rings in a parallel manner. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 269 802. The prostatic stent may be composed of thermoplastic material and a circumferential reinforcing helical spring which provides rigid mechanical support while being flexible to accommodate the natural anatomical bend of the prostatic urethra. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 069 169.

In another aspect genital urinary stents include fallopian stents and other female genital urinary devices. For example the genital urinary device may be a female urinary incontinence device composed of a vaginal insertable supporting portion that is resilient and flexible which is capable of self support by expansion against the vaginal wall and extending about the urethral orifice. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 3 661 155. The genital urinary device may be a urinary evacuation device composed of an ovular bulbous concave wall having an opening to a body engaging perimetal edge integral with the wall and an attached tubular member with a pleated body. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 041 448.

The present invention provides for the combination of a paclitaxel derivative and an ear nose throat ENT stent device e.g. a lacrimal duct stent Eustachian tube stent nasal stent or sinus stent .

The sinuses are four pairs of hollow regions contained in the bones of the skull named after the bones in which they are located ethmoid maxillary frontal and sphenoid . All are lined by respiratory mucosa which is directly attached to the bone. Following an inflammatory insult such as an upper respiratory tract infection or allergic rhinitis a purulent form of sinusitis can develop. Occasionally secretions can be retained in the sinus due to altered ciliary function or obstruction of the opening ostea that drains the sinus. Incomplete drainage makes the sinus prone to infection typically with acnes and certain species of fungi.

When initial treatment such as antibiotics intranasal steroid sprays and decongestants are ineffective it may become necessary to perform surgical drainage of the infected sinus. Surgical therapy often involves debridement of the ostea to remove anatomic obstructions and removal of parts of the mucosa. Occasionally a stent a cylindrical tube which physically holds the lumen of the ostea open is left in the osta to ensure drainage is maintained even in the presence of postoperative swelling. ENT stents typically made of stainless steel or plastic remain in place for several days or several weeks before being removed.

Although the above therapeutic agents have been provided for the purposes of illustration it should be understood that the present invention is not so limited. Further more than one therapeutic agent may be utilized at a time i.e. in combination or delivered sequentially.

In the practice of this invention drug coated or drug impregnated implants and medical devices are provided which inhibit fibrosis in and around the device or prevent stenosis of the device implant in situ thus enhancing the efficacy. Within various embodiments fibrosis is inhibited by local or systemic release of specific pharmacological agents that become localized to the tissue adjacent to the device or implant. There are numerous methods available for optimizing delivery of the paclitaxel derivative to the site of the intervention and several of these are described below.

In one aspect the present invention provides stents which comprise a paclitaxel derivative which inhibits fibrosis on at least one surface of or around the medical device once deployed in the patient. In certain embodiments the stent device may be adapted to release the agent upon deployment of the device in the patient. The paclitaxel derivative may be released from all or only a portion of the stent. For example the derivative may be released at only the distal ends or along the entire body of the device. Paclitaxel derivatives may be associated with stents in a variety of manners including by a directly affixing to the implant or device a desired therapeutic agent or composition containing the therapeutic agent e.g by either spraying or electrospraying the medical implant with a drug and or carrier polymeric or non polymeric drug composition to create a film and or coating on all or part of an internal or external surface of the device by dipping the implant or device into a drug and or carrier polymeric or non polymeric drug solution to coat all or part of the device or implant or by other covalent or noncovalent attachment of the therapeutic agent to the device or implant surface b by coating the medical device or implant with a substance such as a hydrogel which either contains or which will in turn absorb the desired paclitaxel derivative or composition c by interweaving a thread comprised of a paclitaxel derivative into the medical implant or device e.g. a polymeric strand comprised of a paclitaxel derivative composition or polymers which release a paclitaxel derivative from the thread d by covering all or a portion of the device or implant with a sleeve cover electrospun fabric or mesh comprising a paclitaxel derivative i.e. a covering comprised of a paclitaxel derivative a paclitaxel derivative or polymerized composition containing paclitaxel derivatives e constructing all or part of the device or implant itself with the desired agent or composition e.g. a paclitaxel derivative or polymerized compositions of paclitaxel derivatives f otherwise impregnating the device or implant with a desired paclitaxel derivative or composition g composing all or part of the device or implant from a metal alloy that inhibits fibrosis h utilizing specialized multi drug releasing medical device systems for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 527 799 6 293 967 6 290 673 6 241 762 U.S. Application Publication Nos. 2003 0199970A1 and 2003 0167085A1 and PCT Publication WO 03 015664 to deliver paclitaxel derivatives alone or in combination and i constructing all or part of the device or implant itself from a degradable or non degradable polymer that is capable of releasing one or more paclitaxel derivatives e.g. the paclitaxel derivative can be combined with the materials that are used to make the device such that the paclitaxel derivative is incorporated into the final device this can include the stent structure itself the outer covering or sleeve if applicable or both the stent structure and the outer covering or sleeve .

As described above a range of polymeric and non polymeric materials can be used to incorporate the paclitaxel derivative onto or into a device. Coating of the device with the paclitaxel derivative or a composition that comprises the paclitaxel derivative is one method that may be used to associate the agent with the device. The anti fibrosing agent or anti fibrosing composition may be coated onto the entire device or a portion of the device using a method such as dipping spraying painting or vacuum deposition that is appropriate for the particular type of device. For these devices the coating process can be performed in such a manner as to a coat the external surface of the stent b coat the internal luminal surface of the stentor c coat all or parts of both the internal and external surfaces of the stent.

Dip coating is one coating process that can be used. In one embodiment the paclitaxel derivative is dissolved in a solvent for the fibrosis agent and is then coated onto the device.

In one embodiment the solvent is an inert solvent for the device such that the solvent does not dissolve the medical device to any great extent and is not absorbed by the device to any great extent. The device can be immersed either partially or completely in the paclitaxel derivative solvent solution for a specific period of time. The rate of immersion into the paclitaxel derivative solvent solution can be altered e.g. 0.001 cm per sec to 50 cm per sec . The device can then be removed from the solution. The rate at which the device can be withdrawn from the solution can be altered e.g. 0.001 cm per sec to 50 cm per sec . The coated device can be air dried. The dipping process can be repeated one or more times depending on the specific application. The device can be dried under vacuum to reduce residual solvent levels. This process will result in the paclitaxel derivative being coated on the surface of the device.

In one embodiment the solvent is one that will not dissolve the device but will be absorbed by the device. These solvents can thus swell the device to some extent. The device can be immersed either partially or completely in the paclitaxel derivative solvent solution for a specific period of time seconds to days . The rate of immersion into the paclitaxel derivative solvent solution can be altered e.g. 0.001 cm per sec to 50 cm per sec . The device can then be removed from the solution. The rate at which the device can be withdrawn from the solution can be altered e.g. 0.001 cm per sec to 50 cm per sec . The coated device can be air dried. The dipping process can be repeated one or more times depending on the specific application. The device can be dried under vacuum to reduce residual solvent levels. This process will result in the paclitaxel derivative being adsorbed into the medical device. The paclitaxel derivative may also be present on the surface of the device. The amount of surface associated paclitaxel derivative may be reduced by dipping the coated device into a solvent for the paclitaxel derivative or by spraying the coated device with a solvent for the paclitaxel derivative.

In one embodiment the solvent is one that will be absorbed by the device and that will dissolve the device. The device can be immersed either partially or completely in the paclitaxel derivative solvent solution for a specific period of time seconds to hours . The rate of immersion into the paclitaxel derivative solvent solution can be altered e.g. 0.001 cm per sec to 50 cm per sec . The device can then be removed from the solution. The rate at which the device can be withdrawn from the solution can be altered e.g. 0.001 cm per sec to 50 cm per sec . The coated device can be air dried. The dipping process can be repeated one or more times depending on the specific application. The device can be dried under vacuum to reduce residual solvent levels. This process will result in the paclitaxel derivative being adsorbed into the medical device as well as being surface associated. In a preferred embodiment the exposure time of the device to the solvent can be such that there are no significant permanent dimensional changes to the device. The paclitaxel derivative may also be present on a surface of the device. The amount of surface associated paclitaxel derivative may be reduced by dipping the coated device into a solvent for the paclitaxel derivative or by spraying the coated device with a solvent for the paclitaxel derivative.

In the above description the device can be a device that has not been modified as well as a device that has been further modified by association with a polymer surface treated by plasma treatment flame treatment corona treatment surface oxidation or reduction surface etching mechanical smoothing or roughening or grafting prior to the affixing process.

In one embodiment the paclitaxel derivative and a polymer are dissolved in a solvent for both the polymer and the fibrosis inhibiting agent and are then coated onto the device together or separately.

In any one of the above dip coating methods the surface of the device can be treated with a plasma polymerization method prior to coating of the scarring agent or scarring agent containing composition such that a thin polymeric layer is deposited onto a surface of the device. Examples of such methods include parylene coating of devices and the use of various monomers such hydrocyclosiloxane monomers. Parylene coating may be especially advantageous if the device or a portion of the device is composed of materials e.g. stainless steel nitinol that do not allow incorporation of the therapeutic agent s into a surface using one of the above methods. A parylene primer layer may be deposited onto the device using a parylene coater e.g. PDS 2010 LABCOTER2 from Cookson Electronics and a suitable reagent e.g. di p xylylene or dichloro di p xylylene as the coating feed material. Parylene compounds are commercially available for example from Specialty Coating Systems Indianapolis Ind. including PARYLENE N di p xylylene PARYLENE C a monchlorinated derivative of PARYLENE N and PARYLENE D a dichlorinated derivative of PARYLENE N .

In one embodiment the solvent is an inert solvent for the device such that the solvent does not dissolve the medical device to any great extent and is not absorbed by the device to any great extent. The device can be immersed either partially or completely in a paclitaxel derivative polymer solvent solution for a specific period of time The rate of immersion into the paclitaxel derivative polymer solvent solution can be altered e.g. 0.001 cm per sec to 50 cm per sec . The device can then be removed from the solution. The rate at which the device can be withdrawn from the solution can be altered e.g. 0.001 cm per sec to 50 cm per sec . The coated device can be air dried. The dipping process can be repeated one or more times depending on the specific application. The device can be dried under vacuum to reduce residual solvent levels. This process will result in the paclitaxel derivative polymer being coated on a surface of the device.

In the above description the device can be a device that has not been modified as well as a device that has been further modified by coating with a polymer e.g. parylene surface treated by plasma treatment flame treatment corona treatment surface oxidation or reduction surface etching mechanical smoothing or roughening or grafting prior to the coating process.

In another embodiment a suspension of the paclitaxel derivative in a polymer solution can be prepared. The suspension can be prepared by choosing a solvent that can dissolve the polymer but not the paclitaxel derivative or a solvent that can dissolve the polymer and in which the paclitaxel derivative is above its solubility limit. In similar processes described above a device can be dipped into the suspension of the fibrosis inhibiting and polymer solution such that the device is coated with a polymer that has a paclitaxel derivative suspended within it.

Spray coating is another coating process that can be used. In a spray coating process a solution or suspension of a paclitaxel derivative with or without a polymeric or non polymeric carrier is nebulized and directed to the device to be coated by a stream of gas. One can use spray devices such as an air brush for example models 2020 360 175 100 200 150 350 250 400 3000 4000 5000 6000 from Badger Air brush Company Franklin Park IL spray painting equipment TLC reagent sprayers for example Part 14545 and 14654 Alltech Associates Inc. Deerfield IL and ultrasonic spray devices for example those available from Sono Tek Milton NY . One can also use powder sprayers and electrostatic sprayers.

In one embodiment the paclitaxel derivative is dissolved in a solvent for the fibrosis agent and is then sprayed onto the device.

In one embodiment the solvent is an inert solvent for the device such that the solvent does not dissolve the medical device to any great extent and is not absorbed by the device to any great extent. The device can be held in place or the device can be mounted onto a mandrel or rod that has the ability to move in an X Y or Z plane or a combination of these planes. Using one of the above described spray devices the device can be spray coated such that the device is either partially or completely coated with the paclitaxel derivative solvent solution. The rate of spraying of the paclitaxel derivative solvent solution can be altered e.g. 0.001 ml per sec to 10 mL per sec to ensure that a good coating of the paclitaxel derivative is obtained. The coated device can air dried. The spray coating process can be repeated one or more times depending on the specific application. The device can be dried under vacuum to reduce residual solvent levels. This process will result in the paclitaxel derivative being coated on a surface of the device.

In all such embodiments the devices may comprise one or more partial or complete coatings comprising a paclitaxel derivative. The devices may also comprise a paclitaxel derivative free top coating.

In another aspect a paclitaxel derivative may be delivered to the treatment site via systemic regional or local delivery methods. In one aspect the paclitaxel derivative or a composition comprising a paclitaxel derivative may be infiltrated into or onto tissue surrounding the stent. The tissue cavity into which the stent is placed can be treated with a paclitaxel derivative prior to during or after the procedure. Several of the techniques that can be used to achieve preferentially elevated levels of paclitaxel derivatives in the vicinity of the stent include a using drug delivery catheters for local regional or systemic delivery of fibrosis inhibiting agents to the tissue surrounding the device or implant typically drug delivery catheters are advanced through the circulation or inserted directly into tissues under radiological guidance e.g. magnetic ultrasonic or MRI guidance until they reach the desired anatomical location the fibrosis inhibiting agent can then be released from the catheter lumen in high local concentrations in order to deliver therapeutic doses of the drug to the tissue surrounding the device or implant b chemical modification of the fibrosis inhibiting drug or formulation designed to increase uptake of the agent into damaged tissues e.g. antibodies directed against damaged or healing tissue components such as macrophages neutrophils smooth muscle cells fibroblasts extracellular matrix components neovascular tissue c chemical modification of the fibrosis inhibiting drug or formulation designed to localize the drug to areas of bleeding or disrupted vasculature d direct injection of the paclitaxel derivative into the tissue for example under endoscopic vision and or applying the composition into the anatomical space where the device will be placed e.g. using a sprayable formulation or a polymeric gel loaded with a paclitaxel derivative where the composition may be applied to the implantation site e.g. topical application or the implant device surface.

As described previously desired paclitaxel derivatives may be admixed with blended with conjugated to or otherwise modified to contain a polymer composition which may be either biodegradable or non biodegradable or a non polymeric composition in order to release the therapeutic agent and in a preferred embodiment over a prolonged period of time. For many of the aforementioned embodiments localized delivery as well as localized sustained delivery of the fibrosis inhibiting agent may be desired. For example a desired paclitaxel derivative may be admixed with blended with conjugated to or otherwise modified to contain a polymeric composition which may be either biodegradable or non biodegradable or non polymeric composition in order to release the paclitaxel derivative over a period of time.

In one embodiment all or a portion of the device is coated with a primer bonding layer and a drug release layer as described in U.S. Patent application entitled Stent with Medicated Multi Layer Hybrid Polymer Coating filed Sep. 16 2003 U.S. Ser. No. 10 662 877 .

In order to develop a hybrid polymer delivery system for targeted therapy it is desirable to be able to control and manipulate the properties of the system both in terms of physical and drug release characteristics. The active agents can be imbibed into a surface hybrid polymer layer or incorporated directly into the hybrid polymer coating solutions. Imbibing drugs into surface polymer layers is an efficient method for evaluating polymer drug performance in the laboratory but for commercial production it may be preferred for the polymer and drug to be premixed in the casting mixture. Greater efficacy can be achieved by combining the two elements in the coating compostions in order to control the ratio of active agent to polymer in the coatings. Such ratios are important parameters to the final properties of the medicated layers i.e. they allow for better control of active agent concentration and duration of pharmacological activity.

Typical polymers used in the drug release system can include water insoluble cellulose esters various polyurethane polymers including hydrophilic and hydrophobic versions hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol PEG polyethylene oxide PEO polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP PVP copolymers such as vinyl acetate hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA and copolymers such as methylmethacrylate PMMA HEMA and other hydrophilic and hydrophobic acrylate polymers and copolymers containing functional groups such as carboxyl and or hydroxyl.

Cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate cellulose acetate propionate cellulose acetate butyrate cellulose acetate phthalate and cellulose nitrate may be used. In one aspect of the invention the therapeutic agent is formulated with a cellulose ester. Cellulose nitrate is a preferred cellulose ester because of its compatibility with the active agents and its ability to impart non tackiness and cohesiveness to the coatings. Cellulose nitrate has been shown to stabilize entrapped drugs in ambient and processing conditions. Various grades of cellulose nitrate are available and may be used in a coating on a device including cellulose nitrate having a nitrogen content 11.8 12.2 . Various viscosity grades including 3.5 0.5 or 0.25 seconds may be used in order to provide proper rheological properties when combined with the coating solids used in these formulations. Higher or lower viscosity grades can be used. However the higher viscosity grades can be more difficult to use because of their higher viscosities. Thus the lower viscosity grades such as 3.5 0.5 or 0.25 seconds are generally preferred. Physical properties such as tensile strength elongation flexibility and softening point are related to viscosity molecular weight and can decrease with the lower molecular weight species especially below the 0.25 second grades.

The cellulose derivatives comprise hydroglucose structures. Cellulose nitrate is a hydrophobic water insoluble polymer and has high water resistance properties. This structure leads to high compatibility with many active agents accounting for the high degree of stabilization provided to drugs entrapped in cellulose nitrate. The structure of nitrocellulose is given below 

Cellulose nitrate is a hard relatively inflexible polymer and has limited adhesion to many polymers that are typically used to make medical devices. Also control of drug elution dynamics is limited if only one polymer is used in the binding matrix. Accordingly in one embodiment of the invention the therapeutic agent is formulated with two or more polymers before being associated with the device. In one aspect the agent is formulated with the both polyurethane e.g. CHRONOFLEX AR CHRONOFLEX AL and BIONATE PELLETHANE and cellulose nitrate to provide a hybrid polymer drug loaded matrix. Polyurethanes provide the hybrid polymer matrix with greater flexibility and adhesion to the device particularly when the device has been pre coated with a primer. Polyurethanes can also be used to slow or hasten the drug elution from coatings. Aliphatic aromatic polytetramethylene ether glycol and polycarbonate are among the types of polyurethanes which can be used in the coatings. In one aspect a paclitaxel derivative e.g. paclitaxel may be incorporated into a carrier that includes a polyurethane and a cellulose derivative. A heparin complex such as benzalkonium heparinate or tridodecylammonium heparinate may optionally be included in the formulation.

From the structure below it is possible to see how more or less hydrophilic polyurethane polymers may be created based on the number of hydrophilic groups contained in the polymer structures. In one aspect of the invention the device is associated with a formulation that includes therapeutic agent cellulose ester and a polyurethane that is water insoluble flexible and compatible with the cellulose ester.

Polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP is a polyamide that possesses unusual complexing and colloidal properties and is essentially physiologically inert. PVP and other hydrophilic polymers are typically biocompatible. PVP may be incorporated into drug loaded hybrid polymer compositions in order to increase drug release rates. In one embodiment the concentration of PVP that is used in drug loaded hybrid polymer compositions can be less than 20 . This concentration cannot make the layers bioerodable or lubricious. In general PVP concentrations from 

Acrylate polymers and copolymers including polymethylmethacrylate PMMA and polymethylmethacrylate hydroxyethyl methacrylate PMMA HEMA are known for their biocompatibility as a result of their widespread use in contact and intraocular lens applications. This class of polymer generally provokes very little smooth muscle and endothelial cell growth and very low inflammatory response Bar . These polymers copolymers are compatible with drugs and the other polymers and layers of the instant invention. Thus in one aspect the device is associated with a composition that comprises a paclitaxel derivative as described above and an acrylate polymer or copolymer.

It should be obvious to one of skill in the art that the polymers as described herein can also be blended or copolymerized in various compositions as required to deliver therapeutic doses of paclitaxel derivatives.

Polymeric carriers for paclitaxel derivatives can be fashioned in a variety of forms with desired release characteristics and or with specific properties depending upon the device composition or implant being utilized. For example polymeric carriers may be fashioned to release a paclitaxel derivative upon exposure to a specific triggering event such as pH see e.g. Heller et al. Chemically Self Regulated Drug Delivery Systems in Elsevier Science Publishers B.V. Amsterdam 1988 pp. 175 188 Kang et al. 48 343 354 1993 Dong et al. 19 171 178 1992 Dong and Hoffman 15 141 152 1991 Kim et al. 28 143 152 1994 Cornejo Bravo et al. 33 223 229 1995 Wu and Lee 10 10 1544 1547 1993 Serres et al. 13 2 196 201 1996 Peppas Fundamentals of pH and Temperature Sensitive Delivery Systems in Gurny et al. eds. Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH Stuttgart 1993 pp. 41 55 Doelker Cellulose Derivatives 1993 in Peppas and Langer eds. Springer Verlag Berlin . Representative examples of pH sensitive polymers include poly acrylic acid and its derivatives including for example homopolymers such as poly aminocarboxylic acid poly acrylic acid poly methyl acrylic acid copolymers of such homopolymers and copolymers of poly acrylic acid and or acrylate or acrylamide lmonomers such as those discussed above. Other pH sensitive polymers include polysaccharides such as cellulose acetate phthalate hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate cellulose acetate trimellilate and chitosan. Yet other pH sensitive polymers include any mixture of a pH sensitive polymer and a water soluble polymer.

Within certain aspects of the present invention therapeutic compositions may be fashioned in the form of microspheres microparticles and or nanoparticles having any size ranging from about 30 nm to 500 m depending upon the particular use. These compositions can be formed by spray drying methods milling methods coacervation methods W O emulsion methods W O W emulsion methods and solvent evaporation methods. In other aspects these compositions can include microemulsions emulsions liposomes and micelles. Alternatively such compositions may also be readily applied as a spray which solidifies into a film or coating for use as a device implant surface coating or to line the tissues of the implantation site. Such sprays may be prepared from microspheres of a wide array of sizes including for example from 0.1 m to 3 m from 10 m to 30 m and from 30 m to 100 m.

Such thermopastes maybe readily made utilizing a variety of techniques see e.g. PCT Publication WO 98 24427 . Other pastes may be applied as a liquid which solidify in vivo due to dissolution of a water soluble component of the paste and precipitation of encapsulated drug into the aqueous body environment.

Within another aspect of the invention the paclitaxel derivative can be delivered with a non polymeric agent. These non polymeric carriers can include sucrose derivatives e.g. sucrose acetate isobutyrate sucrose oleate sterols such as cholesterol stigmasterol sitosterol and estradiol cholesteryl esters such as cholesteryl stearate C Cfatty acids such as lauric acid myristic acid palmitic acid stearic acid arachidic acid behenic acid and lignoceric acid C Cmono di and triacylglycerides such as glyceryl monooleate glyceryl monolinoleate glyceryl monolaurate glyceryl monodocosanoate glyceryl monomyristate glyceryl monodicenoate glyceryl dipalmitate glyceryl didocosanoate glyceryl dimyristate glyceryl didecenoate glyceryl tridocosanoate glyceryl trimyristate glyceryl tridecenoate glycerol tristearate and mixtures thereof sucrose fatty acid esters such as sucrose distearate and sucrose palmitate sorbitan fatty acid esters such as sorbitan monostearate sorbitan monopalmitate and sorbitan tristearate C Cfatty alcohols such as cetyl alcohol myristyl alcohol stearyl alcohol and cetostearyl alcohol esters of fatty alcohols and fatty acids such as cetyl palmitate and cetearyl palmitate anhydrides of fatty acids such as stearic anhydride phospholipids including phosphatidylcholine lecithin phosphatidylserine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylinositol and lysoderivatives thereof sphingosine and derivatives thereof spingomyelins such as stearyl palmitoyl and tricosanyl spingomyelins ceramides such as stearyl and palmitoyl ceramides glycosphingolipids lanolin and lanolin alcohols calcium phosphate sintered and unscintered hydoxyapatite zeolites and combinations and mixtures thereof.

Representative examples of patents relating to non polymeric delivery systems and the preparation include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 736 152 5 888 533 6 120 789 5 968 542 and 5 747 058.

The paclitaxel derivative may be delivered as a solution. The paclitaxel derivative can be incorporated directly into the solution to provide a homogeneous solution or dispersion. In certain embodiments the solution is an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution may further include buffer salts as well as viscosity modifying agents e.g. hyaluronic acid alginates carboxymethylcelluloe CMC and the like . In another aspect of the invention the solution can include a biocompatible solvent such as ethanol DMSO glycerol PEG 200 PEG 300 or NMP.

Within another aspect of the invention the paclitaxel derivative can further comprise a secondary carrier. The secondary carrier can be in the form of microspheres e.g. PLGA PLLA PDLLA PCL gelatin polydioxanone poly alkylcyanoacrylate nanospheres PLGA PLLA PDLLA PCL gelatin polydioxanone poly alkylcyanoacrylate liposomes emulsions microemulsions micelles SDS block copolymers of the form X Y X Y X or Y X Y R Y X R X Y where X is a polyalkylene oxide e.g. poly ethylene oxide poly propylene oxide block copolymers of poly ethylene oxide and poly propylene oxide and Y is a polyester e.g. polyester can comprise the residues of one or more of the monomers selected from lactide lactic acid glycolide glycolic acid caprolactone gamma caprolactone hydroxyvaleric acid hydroxybutyric acid beta butyrolactone gamma butyrolactone gamma valerolactone decanolactone decanolactone trimethlene carbonate 1 4 dioxane 2 one or 1 5 dioxepan 2one . R is a multifunctional initiator and copolymers as well as blends thereof. zeolites or cyclodextrins.

Within another aspect of the invention these paclitaxel derivative secondary carrier compositions can be a incorporated directly into or onto the device b incorporated into a solution c incorporated into a gel or viscous solution d incorporated into the composition used for coating the device or e incorporated into or onto the device following coating of the device with a coating composition.

For example paclitaxel derivative loaded PLGA microspheres can be incorporated into a polyurethane coating solution which is then coated onto the device.

In yet another example the device can be coated with a polyurethane and then allowed to partially dry such that the surface is still tacky. A particulate form of the paclitaxel derivative or paclitaxel derivative secondary carrier can be applied to all or a portion of the tacky coating after which the device is dried.

In yet another example the device can be coated with one of the coatings described above. A thermal treatment process can then be used to soften the coating after which the paclitaxel derivative or the paclitaxel derivative secondary carrier is applied to the entire device or to a portion of the device e.g. outer surface 

Within another aspect of the invention the coated device which inhibits or reduces an in vivo fibrotic reaction is further coated with a compound or compositions which delay the release of and or activity of the paclitaxel derivative. Representative examples of such agents include biologically inert materials such as gelatin PLGA MePEG film PLA polyurethanes silicone rubbers surfactants lipids or polyethylene glycol as well as biologically active materials such as heparin e.g. to induce coagulation .

For example in one embodiment of the invention the active agent on the device is top coated with a physical barrier. Such barriers can include non degradable materials or biodegradable materials such as gelatin PLGA MePEG film PLA or polyethylene glycol among others. In one embodiment the rate of diffusion of the therapeutic agent in barrier coat is slower that the rate of diffusion of the therapeutic agent in the layer. In the case of PLGA MePEG once the PLGA Me PEG becomes exposed to the bloodstream the MePEG can dissolve out of the PLGA leaving channels through the PLGA layer to an underlying layer containing the paclitaxel derivative which then can then diffuse into the vessel wall and initiate its biological activity.

In another embodiment of the invention a particulate form of the active agent may be coated onto the stent or any of the devices described below using a polymer e.g. PLG PLA or a polyurethane . A second polymer that dissolves slowly or degrades e.g. MePEG PLGA or PLG and that does not contain the active agent may be coated over the first layer. Once the top layer dissolves or degrades it exposes the under coating which allows the active agent to be exposed to the treatment site or to be released from the coating.

Within another aspect of the invention the outer layer of the coating of a coated device which inhibits an in vivo fibrotic response is further treated to crosslink the outer layer of the coating. This can be accomplished by subjecting the coated device to a plasma treatment process. The degree of crosslinking and nature of the surface modification can be altered by changing the RF power setting the location with respect to the plasma the duration of treatment as well as the gas composition introduced into the plasma chamber.

Protection of a biologically active surface can also be utilized by coating the device surface with an inert molecule that prevents access to the active site through steric hindrance or by coating the surface with an inactive form of the paclitaxel derivative which is later activated. For example the device can be coated with an enzyme which causes either release of the paclitaxel derivative or activates the paclitaxel derivative.

In another embodiment the device is coated with a paclitaxel derivative and then further coated with a composition that comprises an anticoagulant such as heparin. As the antlcoagulant dissolves away the anticoagulant activity slows or stops and the newly exposed paclitaxel derivative is available to inhibit or reduce fibrosis from occurring in the adjacent tissue.

The device can be coated with an inactive form of the paclitaxel derivative which is then activated once the device is deployed. Such activation can be achieved by injecting another material into the treatment area after the device as described below is deployed or after the paclitaxel derivative has been administered to the treatment area via e.g. injections spray wash drug delivery catheters or balloons . For example the device can be coated with an inactive form of the paclitaxel derivative. Once the device is deployed the activating substance is injected or applied into or onto the treatment site where the inactive form of the paclitaxel derivative has been applied. For example a device can be coated with a biologically active paclitaxel derivative and a first substance having moieties that capable of forming an ester bond with another material. The coating can be covered with a second substance such as polyethylene glycol. The first and second substances can react to form an ester bond via e.g. a condensation reaction. Prior to the deployment of the device an esterase is injected into the treatment site around the outside of the device which can cleave the bond between the ester and the paclitaxel derivative allowing the agent to initiate fibrosis inhibition.

In another aspect a medical device may include a plurality of reservoirs within its structure each reservoir configured to house and protect a therapeutic drug. The reservoirs may be formed from divets in the device surface or micropores or channels in the device body. In one aspect the reservoirs are formed from voids in the structure of the device. The reservoirs may be coated with a single type of drug or more than one type of drug. The drug s may be formulated with a carrier e.g. a polymeric or non polymeric material that is coated on the reservoirs. The coated reservoir can function as a drug delivery depot which can release drug over a period of time dependent on the release kinetics of the drug from the carrier. In certain embodiments the reservoir may be coated with a plurality of layers. Each layer may include a different drug having a particular amount dose of drug and each layer may have a different composition to further tailor the amount of drug that is released from the substrate. The multi layered carrier may further include a barrier layer that prevents release of the drug s . The barrier layer can be used for example to control the direction that the drug elutes from the void. In a preferred embodiment this drug coated medical device may further comprise a paclitaxel derivative in one or more reservoirs.

Within certain embodiments of the invention the therapeutic compositions may also comprise additional ingredients such as surfactants e.g. PLURONICS such as F 127 L 122 L 101 L 92 L 81 and L 61 anti inflammatory agents e.g. dexamethasone or aspirin anti thrombotic agents e.g. heparin high activity heparin heparin quaternary amine complexes e.g. heparin benzalkonium chloride complex anti infective agents e.g. 5 fluorouracil triclosan rifamycim and silver compounds preservatives anti oxidants and or anti platelet agents.

Within certain embodiments of the invention the therapeutic agent or carrier can also comprise radio opaque echogenic materials and magnetic resonance imaging MRI responsive materials i.e. MRI contrast agents to aid in visualization of the device under ultrasound fluoroscopy and or MRI. For example a device may be made with or coated with a composition which is echogenic or radiopaque e.g. made with echogenic or radiopaque with materials such as powdered tantalum tungsten barium carbonate bismuth oxide barium sulfate metrazimide iopamidol iohexol iopromide iobitridol iomeprol iopentol ioversol ioxilan iodixanol iotrolan acetrizoic acid derivatives diatrizoic acid derivatives iothalamic acid derivatives ioxithalamic acid derivatives metrizoic acid derivatives iodamide lypophylic agents iodipamide and ioglycamic acid or by the addition of microspheres or bubbles which present an acoustic interface . Visualization of a device by ultrasonic imaging may be achieved using an echogenic coating. Echogenic coatings are described in e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 106 473 and 6 610 016. For visualization under MRI contrast agents e.g. gadolinium III chelates or iron oxide compounds may be incorporated into or onto the device such as for example as a component in a coating or within the void volume of the device e.g. within a lumen reservoir or within the structural material used to form the device . In some embodiments a medical device may include radio opaque or MRI visible markers e.g. bands that may be used to orient and guide the device during the implantation procedure.

In another embodiment these agents can be contained within the same coating layer as the therapeutic agent or they may be contained in a coating layer as described above that is either applied before or after the therapeutic agent containing layer.

The medical implants may alternatively or in addition be visualized under visible light using fluorescence or by other spectroscopic means. Visualization agents that can be included for this purpose include dyes pigments and other colored agents. In one aspect the medical implant may further include a colorant to improve visualization of the implant in vivo and or ex vivo. Frequently implants can be difficult to visualize upon insertion especially at the margins of implant. A coloring agent can be incorporated into a medical implant to reduce or eliminate the incidence or severity of this problem. The coloring agent provides a unique color increased contrast or unique fluorescence characteristics to the device. In one aspect a solid implant is provided that includes a colorant such that it is readily visible under visible light or using a fluorescence technique and easily differentiated from its implant site. In another aspect a colorant can be included in a liquid or semi solid composition. For example a single component of a two component mixture may be colored such that when combined ex vivo or in vivo the mixture is sufficiently colored.

The coloring agent may be for example an endogenous compound e.g. an amino acid or vitamin or a nutrient or food material and may be a hydrophobic or a hydrophilic compound. Preferably the colorant has a very low or no toxicity at the concentration used. Also preferred are colorants that are safe and normally enter the body through absorption such as carotene. Representative examples of colored nutrients under visible light include fat soluble vitamins such as Vitamin A yellow water soluble vitamins such as Vitamin B12 pink red and folic acid yellow orange carotenoids such as carotene yellow purple and lycopene red . Other examples of coloring agents include natural product berry and fruit extracts such as anthrocyanin purple and saffron extract dark red . The coloring agent may be a fluorescent or phosphorescent compound such as tocopherolquinol a Vitamin E derivative or L tryptophan. Derivatives analogues and isomers of any of the above colored compound also may be used. The method for incorporating a colorant into an implant or therapeutic composition may be varied depending on the properties of and the desired location for the colorant. For example a hydrophobic colorant may be selected for hydrophobic matrices. The colorant may be incorporated into a carrier matrix such as micelles. Further the pH of the environment may be controlled to further control the color and intensity.

In one aspect the composition of the present invention include one or more coloring agents also referred to as dyestuffs which will be present in an effective amount to impart observable voloration to the composition e.g. the gel. Example of coloring agents include dyes suitable for food such as those known as F.D. C. dyes and natural coloring agents such as grape skin extract beet red powder beta carotene annato carmine turmeric paprika and so forth. Derivatives analogues and isomers of any of the above colored compound also may be used. The method for incorporating a colorant into an implant or therapeutic composition may be varied depending on the properties of and the desired location for the colorant. For example a hydrophobic color and may be selected for hydrophobic matrices. The colorant may be incorporated into a carrier matrix such as micelles. Further the pH of the environment may be controlled to further control the color and intensity.

In one aspect the compositions of the present invention include one or more preservatives or bacteriostatic agents present in an effective amount to preserve the composition and or inhibit bacterial growth in the composition for example bismuth tribromophenate methyl hydroxybenzoate bacitracin ethyl hydroxybenzoate propyl hydroxybenzoate erythromycin 5 fluorouracil methotrexate doxorubicin mitoxantrone rifamycin chlorocresol benzalkonium chlorides and the like. Examples of the preservative include paraoxybenzoic acid esters chlorobutanol benzylalcohol phenethyl alcohol dehydroacetic acid sorbic acid etc. In one aspect the compositions of the present invention include one or more bactericidal also known as bacteriacidal agents.

In one aspect the compositions of the present invention include one or more antioxidants present in an effective amount. Examples of the antioxidant include sulfites alpha tocopherol and ascorbic acid.

Within certain aspects of the present invention the therapeutic composition should be biocompatible and release one or more paclitaxel derivatives over a period of several hours days or months. As described above release of an agent refers to any statistically significant presence of the agent or a subcomponent thereof which has disassociated from the compositions. The compositions of the present invention may release the paclitaxel derivative at one or more phases the one or more phases having similar or different performance e. g. release profiles. The therapeutic agent may be made available to the tissue at amounts which may be sustainable intermittent or continuous in one or more phases and or rates of delivery effective to reduce or inhibit any one or more components of fibrosis or scarring including formation of new blood vessels angiogenesis migration and proliferation of connective tissue cells such as fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells deposition of extracellular matrix ECM and remodeling maturation and organization of the fibrous tissue .

Thus release rate may be programmed to impact fibrosis or scarring by releasing a paclitaxel derivative at a time such that at least one of the components of fibrosis is inhibited or reduced. Moreover the predetermined release rate may reduce agent loading and or concentration as well as potentially providing minimal drug washout and thus increases efficiency of drug effect. Any one of the at least one paclitaxel derivatives may perform one or more functions including inhibiting the formation of new blood vessels angiogenesis inhibiting the migration and proliferation of connective tissue cells such as fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells inhibiting the deposition of extracellular matrix ECM and inhibiting remodeling maturation and organization of the fibrous tissue . In one embodiment the rate of release may provide a sustainable level of the paclitaxel derivative to the susceptible tissue site. In another embodiment the rate of release is substantially constant. The rate may decrease and or increase over time and it may optionally include a substantially non release period. The release rate may comprise a plurality of rates. In an embodiment the plurality of release rates may include rates selected from the group consisting of substantially constant decreasing increasing substantially non releasing.

The total amount of paclitaxel derivative made available on in or near the device may be in an amount ranging from about 0.01 g micrograms to about 2500 mg milligrams . Generally the paclitaxel derivative may be in the amount ranging from 0.01 g to about 10 g or from 10 g to about 1 mg or from 1 mg to about 10 mg or from 10 mg to about 100 mg or from 100 mg to about 500 mg or from 500 mg to about 2500 mg.

The total surface amount of paclitaxel derivative on in or near the device may be in an amount ranging from less than 0.01 g to about 2500 g per mmof device surface area. Generally the paclitaxel derivative may be in the amount ranging from less than 0.01 g or from 0.01 g to about 10 g or from 10 g to about 250 g or from 250 g to about 2500 g.

The paclitaxel derivative that is on in or near the device may be released from the composition in a time period that may be measured from the time of implantation which ranges from about less than 1 day to about 180 days. Generally the release time may also be from about less than 1 day to about 7 days from 7 days to about 14 days from 14 days to about 28 days from 28 days to about 56 days from 56 days to about 90 days from 90 days to about 180 days. In certain embodiments the drug is released in effective concentrations for a period ranging from about 1 to about 90 days.

The amount of paclitaxel derivative released from the composition as a function of time may be determined based on the in vitro release characteristics of the agent from the composition. The in vitro release rate may be determined by placing the paclitaxel derivative within the composition or device in an appropriate buffer such as 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 37 C. Samples of the buffer solution are then periodically removed for analysis by HPLC and the buffer is replaced to avoid any saturation effects.

Based on the in vitro release rates the release of paclitaxel derivative per day may range from an amount ranging from about 0.01 g micrograms to about 2500 mg miiligrams . Generally the paclitaxel derivative that may be released in a day may be in the amount ranging from 0.01 g to about 10 g or from 10 g to about 1 mg or from 1 mg to about 10 mg or from 10 mg to about 100 mg or from 100 mg to about 500 mg or from 500 mg to about 2500 mg.

In one embodiment the paclitaxel derivative is made available to the susceptible tissue site in a programmed sustained and or controlled manner which results in increased efficiency and or efficacy. Further the release rates may vary during either or both of the initial and subsequent release phases. There may also be additional phase s for release of the same substance s and or different substance s .

Further therapeutic compositions and devices of the present invention should preferably be have a stable shelf life for several months and capable of being produced and maintained under sterile conditions. Many pharmaceuticals are manufactured to be sterile and this criterion is defined by the USP XXII . The term USP refers to U.S. Pharmacopeia see www.usp.org Rockville Md. . Sterilization may be accomplished by a number of means accepted in the industry and listed in the USP XXII including gas sterilization ionizing radiation or when appropriate filtration. Sterilization may be maintained by what is termed asceptic processing defined also in USP XXII . Acceptable gases used for gas sterilization include ethylene oxide. Acceptable radiation types used for ionizing radiation methods include gamma for instance from a cobalt 60 source and electron beam. A typical dose of gamma radiation is 2.5 MRad. Filtration may be accomplished using a filter with suitable pore size for example 0.22 m and of a suitable material for instance polytetrafluoroethylene e.g. TEFLON from E. I.

There are numerous types of stents where the occurrence of a fibrotic reaction will adversely affect the functioning of the device or the biological problem for which the device was implanted or used. The coating of paclitaxel derivatives such as paclitaxel derivatives onto or incorporation of paclitaxel derivatives into stent devices provides a solution to the clinical problems that can be encountered with these devices.

Generally stents are inserted in a similar fashion regardless of the site or the disease being treated. Briefly a preinsertion examination usually a diagnostic imaging procedure endoscopy or direct visualization at the time of surgery is generally first performed in order to determine the appropriate positioning for stent insertion. A guidewire is then advanced through the lesion or proposed site of insertion and over this is passed a delivery catheter which allows a stent in its collapsed form to be inserted. Intravascular stents may be inserted into an artery such as the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the circulation under radiological guidance until they reach the anatomical location of the plaque in the coronary or peripheral circulation. Typically stents are capable of being compressed so that they can be inserted through tiny cavities via small catheters and then expanded to a larger diameter once they are at the desired location. The delivery catheter then is removed leaving the stent standing on its own as a scaffold. Once expanded the stent physically forces the walls of the passageway apart and holds them open. A post insertion examination usually an x ray is often utilized to confirm appropriate positioning.

Stents are typically maneuvered into place under radiologic or direct visual control taking particular care to place the stent precisely within the vessel being treated. In certain aspects the stent can further include a radio opaque echogenic material or MRI responsive material e.g. MRI contrast agent to aid in visualization of the device under ultrasound fluoroscopy and or magnetic resonance imaging. The radio opaque or MRI visible material may be in the form of one or more markers e.g. bands of material that are disposed on either end of the stent that may be used to orient and guide the device during the implantation procedure.

In another aspect the paclitaxel derivative or a composition comprising a paclitaxel derivative may be infiltrated into or onto tissue surrounding the stent. Alternatively the tissue cavity into which the stent is placed can be treated with a paclitaxel derivative prior to during or after the procedure.

Infiltration of paclitaxel derivatives or compositions comprising paclitaxel derivatives may be accomplished for example using drug delivery catheters for local regional or systemic delivery of fibrosis inhibiting agents to the tissue surrounding the device. The drug delivery catheter may be advanced through the circulation of inserted directly into tissues under radiological guidance e.g. magnetic ultrasonic or MRI until they reach the desired anatomical location. The paclitaxel derivative can then be released from the catheter lumen in high local concentrations in order to deliver therapeutic doses of the drug to the tissue surrounding the device or implant. Alternatively or in addition the paclitaxel derivative or composition comprising the paclitaxel derivative may be injected directly into the treatment site e.g. into the space around the stent or into tissue surrounding the stent under endoscopic vision.

Other methods of infiltrating paclitaxel derivatives into the treatment site include a topical application of the paclitaxel derivative into the anatomical space where the device will be placed particularly useful for this embodiment is the use of polymeric carriers which release the anti fibrosing agent over a period ranging from several hours to several weeks. Compositions that can be used for this application include e.g. fluids microspheres pastes gels hydrogels crosslinked gels microparticulates sprays aerosols solid implants and other formulations which release a fibrosis inhibiting agent into the region where the device or implant will be implanted b microparticulate forms of the therapeutic agent are also useful for directed delivery into the implantation site c sprayable collagen containing formulations such as COSTASIS from Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc. Canada either alone or loaded with a paclitaxel derivative applied to the implantation site or the implant device surface d sprayable PEG containing formulations such as COSEAL Angiotech Pharmaceuticals lnc.

As described above any paclitaxel derivative described above can be combined with a stent device. Further stent devices may be adapted to release a paclitaxel derivative that inhibits one or more of the four general components of the process of fibrosis or scarring including formation of new blood vessels angiogenesis migration and proliferation of connective tissue cells such as fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells deposition of extracellular matrix ECM and remodeling maturation and organization of the fibrous tissue . By inhibiting one or more of the components of fibrosis or scarring the overgrowth of granulation tissue may be inhibited or reduced.

As stent devices are made in a variety of configurations and sizes the exact dose administered will vary with device size surface area and design. However certain principles can be applied in the application of this art. Drug dose can be calculated as a function of dose per unit area of the portion of the device being coated total drug dose administered and appropriate surface concentrations of active drug can be determined. Drugs are to be used at concentrations that range from several times more than 10 5 or even less than 1 of the concentration typically used in a single chemotherapeutic systemic dose application.

Several examples of agents for use with stents include the following 9 deoxotaxol 7 deoxy 9 deoxotaxol and 10 desacetoxy 7 deoxy 9 deoxotaxol.

Regardless of the method of application of the drug to the intravascular device the exemplary agents used alone or in combination should be administered under the following dosing guidelines. The total dose of agent in or on the device may be in the range of about 0.01 g 10 g or 10 g 250 g or 250 g 1 mg or 1 mg 10 mg or 10 mg 250 mg or 250 mg 1000 mg or 1000 mg 2500 mg. The dose of paclitaxel derivative per unit area of device surface to which the agent is applied may be in the range of about 0.01 g mm 1 g mm or 1 g mm 10 g mm or 10 g mm 250 g mm 250 g mm 1000 g mm or 1000 g mm 2500 g mm.

The rabbit uterine horn model is used to assess the anti fibrotic capacity of formulations in vivo. Mature New Zealand White NZW female rabbits are placed under general anesthetic. Using aseptic precautions the abdomen is opened in two layers at the midline to expose the uterus. Both uterine horns are lifted out of the abdominal cavity and assessed for size on the French Scale of catheters. Horns between 8 and 14 on the French Scale mm diameter are deemed suitable for this model. Both uterine horns and the opposing peritoneal wall are abraded with a 10 scalpel blade at a 45 angle over an area 2.5 cm in length and 0.4 cm in width until punctuate bleeding is observed. Abraded surfaces are tamponaded until bleeding stops. The individual horns are then opposed to the peritoneal wall and secured by two sutures placed 2 mm beyond the edges of the abraded area. The formulation is applied and the abdomen is closed in three layers. After 14 days animals are evaluated post mortem with the extent and severity of adhesions being scored both quantitatively and qualitatively.

A rat balloon injury carotid artery model was used to demonstrate the efficacy of a paclitaxel containing mesh system on the development of intimal hyperplasia fourteen days following placement.

Wistar rats weighing g were anesthetized with 1.5 halothane in oxygen and the left external carotid artery was exposed. A 2 French Fogarty balloon embolectomy catheter Baxter Irvine Calif. was advanced through an arteriotomy in the external carotid artery down the left common carotid artery to the aorta. The balloon was inflated with enough saline to generate slight resistance approximately 0.02 ml and it was withdrawn with a twisting motion to the carotid bifurcation. The balloon was then deflated and the procedure repeated twice more. This technique produced distension of the arterial wall and denudation of the endothelium. The external carotid artery was ligated after removal of the catheter. The right common carotid artery was not injured and was used as a control.

Immediately after injury of the left common carotid artery a 1 cm long distal segment of the artery was exposed and treated with a 1 1 cm paclitaxel containing mesh. The wound was then closed the animals were kept for 14 days.

At the time of sacrifice the animals were euthanized with carbon dioxide and pressure perfused at 100 mmHg with 10 phosphate buffered formaldehyde for 15 minutes. Both carotid arteries were harvested and left overnight in fixative. The fixed arteries were processed and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial cross sections were cut at 3 m thickness every 2 mm within and outside the implant region of the injured left carotid artery and at corresponding levels in the control right carotid artery. Cross sections were stained with Mayer s hematoxylin and eosin for cell count and with Movat s pentachrome stains for morphometry analysis and for extracellular matrix composition assessment.

From it is evident that the perivascular delivery of paclitaxel using the paclitaxel mesh formulation resulted is a dramatic reduction in intimal hyperplasia.

Chondrocytes were transfected with constructs containing an AP 1 driven CAT reporter gene and stimulated with IL 1 IL 1 50 ng ml was added and incubated for 24 hours in the absence and presence of paclitaxel at various concentrations. Paclitaxel treatment decreased CAT activity in a concentration dependent manner mean SD . The data noted with an asterisk have significance compared with IL 1 induced CAT activity according to a t test P

Binding activity was assayed with a radiolabeled human AP 1 sequence probe and gel mobility shift assay. Extracts from chondrocytes untreated or treated with various amounts of paclitaxel 10to 10M followed by IL 1 20 ng ml were incubated with excess probe on ice for 30 minutes followed by non denaturing gel electrophoresis. The com lane contains excess unlabeled AP 1 oligonucleotide. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.

Cells were treated with paclitaxel at various concentrations 10to 10M for 24 hours then treated with IL 1 20 ng ml for additional 18 hours in the presence of paclitaxel. Total RNA was isolated and the MMP 1 mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis. The blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed with P radiolabeled rat GAPDH eDNA which was used as a housekeeping gene. The results shown are representative of four independent experiments. Quantitation of collagenase 1 and stromelysin expression mRNA levels. The MMP 1 and MMP 3 expression levels were normalized with GAPDH.

Primary chondrocyte cultures were freshly isolated from calf cartilage. The cells were plated at 2.5 10per ml in 100 20 mm culture dishes and incubated in Ham s F12 medium containing 5 FBS overnight at 37 C. The cells were starved in serum free medium overnight and then treated with anti microtubule agents at various concentrations for 6 hours. IL 1 20 ng ml was then added to each plate and the plates incubated for an additional 18 hours. Total RNA was isolated by the acidified guanidine isothiocyanate method and subjected to electrophoresis on a denatured gel. Denatured RNA samples 15 g were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in a 1 denatured gel transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with the P labeled collagenase cDNA probe. P labeled glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrase GAPDH cDNA as an internal standard to ensure roughly equal loading. The exposed films were scanned and quantitatively analyzed with IMAGEQUANT.

As demonstrated in FIG. B IL 1 stimulated AP 1 transcriptional activity 5 fold. Pretreatment of transiently transfected chondrocytes with paclitaxel reduced IL 1 induced AP 1 reporter gene CAT activity. Thus IL 1 induced AP 1 activity was reduced in chondrocytes by paclitaxel in a concentration dependent manner 10to 10M . These data demonstrated that paclitaxel was a potent inhibitor of AP 1 activity in chondrocytes.

To confirm that paclitaxel inhibition of AP 1 activity was not due to nonspecific effects the effect of paclitaxel on IL 1 induced AP 1 binding to oligonucleotides using chondrocyte nuclear lysates was examined. As shown in IL 1 induced binding activity decreased in lysates from chondrocyte which had been pretreated with paclitaxel at concentration 10to 10M for 24 hours. Paclitaxel inhibition of AP 1 transcriptional activity closely correlated with the decrease in AP 1 binding to DNA.

Since paclitaxel was a potent inhibitor of AP 1 activity the effect of paclitaxel or IL 1 induced collagenase and stromelysin expression two important matrix metalloproteinases involved in inflammatory diseases was examined. Briefly as shown in IL 1 induction increases collagenase and stromelysin mRNA levels in chondrocytes. Pretreatment of chondrocytes with paclitaxel for 24 hours significantly reduced the levels of collagenase and stromelysin mRNA. At 10M paclitaxel there was complete inhibition. The results show that paclitaxel completely inhibited the expression of two matrix metalloproteinases at concentrations similar to which it inhibits AP 1 activity.

Paclitaxel was capable of inhibiting collagenase and stromelysin expression in vitro at concentrations of 10M. Since this inhibition may be explained by the inhibition of AP 1 activity a required step in the induction of all matrix metalloproteinases with the exception of gelatinase B it is expected that paclitaxel may inhibit other matrix metalloproteinases which are AP 1 dependent. The levels of these matrix metalloproteinases are elevated in all inflammatory diseases and play a principle role in matrix degradation cellular migration and proliferation and angiogenesis. Thus paclitaxel inhibition of expression of matrix metalloproteinases such as collagenase and stromelysin will have a beneficial effect in inflammatory diseases.

In addition to paclitaxel s inhibitory effect on collagenase expression LY290181 hexylene glycol deuterium oxide glycine ethyl ester AlF tubercidin epothilone and ethylene glycol bis succinimidylsuccinate all prevented IL 1 induced collagenase expression at concentrations as low as 1 10M. Thus anti microtubule agents are capable of inhibiting the AP 1 pathway at varying concentrations.

Fertilized domestic chick embryos were incubated for 3 days prior to shell less culturing. In this procedure the egg contents were emptied by removing the shell located around the air space. The interior shell membrane was then severed and the opposite end of the shell was perforated to allow the contents of the egg to gently slide out from the blunted end. The egg contents were emptied into round bottom sterilized glass bowls and covered with petri dish covers. These were then placed into an incubator at 90 relative humidity and 3 COand incubated for 3 days.

Paclitaxel Sigma St. Louis Mich. was mixed at concentrations of 0.25 0.5 1 5 10 30 g per 10 ul aliquot of 0.5 aqueous methylcellulose. Since paclitaxel is insoluble in water glass beads were used to produce fine particles. Ten microliter aliquots of this solution were dried on parafilm for 1 hour forming disks 2 mm in diameter. The dried disks containing paclitaxel were then carefully placed at the growing edge of each CAM at day 6 of incubation. Controls were obtained by placing paclitaxel free methylcellulose disks on the CAMs over the same time course. After a 2 day exposure day 8 of incubation the vasculature was examined with the aid of a stereomicroscope. Liposyn II a white opaque solution was injected into the CAM to increase the visibility of the vascular details. The vasculature of unstained living embryos were imaged using a Zeiss stereomicroscope which was interfaced with a video camera Dage MTI Inc. Michigan City Ind. . These video signals were then displayed at 160 magnification and captured using an image analysis system Vidas Kontron Etching Germany . Image negatives were then made on a graphics recorder Model 3000 Matrix Instruments Orangeburg N.Y. .

The membranes of the 8 day old shell less embryo were flooded with 2 glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer additional fixative was injected under the CAM. After 10 minutes in situ the CAM was removed and placed into fresh fixative for 2 hours at room temperature. The tissue was then washed overnight in cacodylate buffer containing 6 sucrose. The areas of interest were postfixed in 1 osmium tetroxide for 1.5 hours at 4 C. The tissues were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols solvent exchanged with propylene oxide and embedded in Spurr resin. Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife placed on copper grids stained and examined in a Joel 1200EX electron microscope. Similarly 0.5 mm sections were cut and stained with toluene blue for light microscopy.

At day 11 of development chick embryos were used for the corrosion casting technique. Mercox resin Ted Pella Inc. Redding Calif. was injected into the CAM vasculature using a 30 gauge hypodermic needle. The casting material consisted of 2.5 grams of Mercox CL 2B polymer and 0.05 grams of catalyst 55 benzoyl peroxide having a 5 minute polymerization time. After injection the plastic was allowed to sit in situ for an hour at room temperature and then overnight in an oven at 65 C. The CAM was then placed in 50 aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide to digest all organic components. The plastic casts were washed extensively in distilled water air dried coated with gold palladium and viewed with the s 501B scanning electron microscope.

Results of the assay were as follows. At day 6 of incubation the embryo was centrally positioned to a radially expanding network of blood vessels the CAM developed adjacent to the embryo. These growing vessels lie close to the surface and are readily visible making this system an idealized model for the study of angiogenesis. Living unstained capillary networks of the CAM may be imaged noninvasively with a stereomicroscope.

Transverse sections through the CAM show an outer ectoderm consisting of a double cell layer a broader mesodermal layer containing capillaries which lie subjacent to the ectoderm adventitial cells and an inner single endodermal cell layer. At the electron microscopic level the typical structural details of the CAM capillaries are demonstrated. Typically these vessels lie in close association with the inner cell layer of ectoderm.

After 48 hours exposure to paclitaxel at concentrations of 0.25 0.5 1 5 10 or 30 g each CAM was examined under living conditions with a stereomicroscope equipped with a video computer interface in order to evaluate the effects on angiogenesis. This imaging setup was used at a magnification of 160 which permitted the direct visualization of blood cells within the capillaries thereby blood flow in areas of interest may be easily assessed and recorded. For this study the inhibition of angiogenesis was defined as an area of the CAM measuring mm in diameter lacking a capillary network and vascular blood flow. Throughout the experiments avascular zones were assessed on a 4 point avascular gradient Table 1 . This scale represents the degree of overall inhibition with maximal inhibition represented as a 3 on the avascular gradient scale. Paclitaxel was very consistent and induced a maximal avascular zone 6 mm in diameter or a 3 on the avascular gradient scale within 48 hours depending on its concentration.

The dose dependent experimental data of the effects of paclitaxel at different concentrations are shown in Table 2.

Typical paclitaxel treated CAMs are also shown with the transparent methylcellulose disk centrally positioned over the avascular zone measuring 6 mm in diameter. At a slightly higher magnification the periphery of such avascular zones is clearly evident the surrounding functional vessels were often redirected away from the source of paclitaxel. Such angular redirecting of blood flow was never observed under normal conditions. Another feature of the effects of paclitaxel was the formation of blood islands within the avascular zone representing the aggregation of blood cells.

In summary this study demonstrated that 48 hours after paclitaxel application to the CAM angiogenesis was inhibited. The blood vessel inhibition formed an avascular zone which was represented by three transitional phases of paclitaxel s effect. The central most affected area of the avascular zone contained disrupted capillaries with extravasated red blood cells this indicated that intercellular junctions between endothelial cells were absent. The cells of the endoderm and ectoderm maintained their intercellular junctions and therefore these germ layers remained intact however they were slightly thickened. As the normal vascular area was approached the blood vessels retained their junctional complexes and therefore also remained intact. At the periphery of the paclitaxel treated zone further blood vessel growth was inhibited which was evident by the typical redirecting or elbowing effect of the blood vessels.

Primary human smooth muscle cells were starved of serum in smooth muscle cell basal media containing insulin and human basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF for 16 hours prior to the assay. For the migration assay cells were trypsinized to remove cells from flasks washed with migration media and diluted to a concentration of cells mL in migration media. Migration media consists of phenol red free Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium DMEM containing 0.35 human serum albumin. A 100 L volume of smooth muscle cells approximately cells was added to the top of a Boyden chamber assembly Chemicon QCM CHEMOTAXIS 96 well migration plate . To the bottom wells the chemotactic agent recombinant human platelet derived growth factor rhPDGF BB was added at a concentration of 10 ng mL in a total volume of 150 L. Paclitaxel was prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 10M and serially diluted 10 fold to give a range of stock concentrations 10M to 10M . Paclitaxel was added to cells by directly adding paclitaxel DMSO stock solutions prepared earlier at a 1 1000 dilution to the cells in the top chamber. Plates were incubated for 4 hours to allow cell migration.

At the end of the 4 hour period cells in the top chamber were discarded and the smooth muscle cells attached to the underside of the filter were detached for 30 minutes at 37 C. in Cell Detachment Solution Chemicon . Dislodged cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing the DNA binding CYQUANT GR dye and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Fluorescence was read in a fluorescence microplate reader at 480 nm excitation wavelength and 520 nm emission maxima. Relative fluorescence units from triplicate wells were averaged after subtracting background fluorescence control chamber without chemoattractant and average number of cells migrating was obtained from a standard curve of smooth muscle cells serially diluted from 25 000 cells well down to 98 cells well. Inhibitory concentration of 50 IC was determined by comparing the average number of cells migrating in the presence of paclitaxel to the positive control smooth muscle cell chemotaxis in response to rhPDGF BB . See IC 0.76 nM . References Biotechniques 2000 29 81 J. Immunol Methods 2001 254 85

The release buffer is prepared by adding 8.22 g sodium chloride 0.32 g sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate and 2.60 g sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous to a beaker. 1L HPLC grade water is added and the solution is stirred until all the salts are dissolved. If required the pH of the solution is adjusted to pH 7.4 0.2 using either 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N phosphoric acid.

A sample of the therapeutic agent loaded catheter is placed in a 15 ml culture tube. 15 ml release buffer Example 33 is added to the culture tube. The tube is sealed with a TEFLON lined screw cap and is placed on a rotating wheel in a 37 C. oven. At various time points the buffer is withdrawn from the culture tube and is replaced with fresh buffer. The withdrawn buffer is then analyzed for the amount of therapeutic agent contained in this buffer solution using HPLC.

Smooth muscle cells at confluency were trypsinized replated at 600 cells well in media in 96 well plates and allowed to attachment overnight. Paclitaxel was prepared in DMSO at a concentration of 10M and diluted 10 fold to give a range of stock concentrations 10M to 10M . Drug dilutions were diluted 1 1000 in media and added to cells to give a total volume of 200 L well. Each drug concentration was tested in triplicate wells. Plates containing cells and paclitaxel were incubated at 37 C. for 72 hours.

To terminate the assay the media was removed by gentle aspiration. A 1 400 dilution of CYQUANT 400X GR dye indicator Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. was added to 1X Cell Lysis buffer and 200 L of the mixture was added to the wells of the plate. Plates were incubated at room temperature protected from light for minutes. Fluorescence was read in a fluorescence microplate reader at 480 nm excitation wavelength and 520 nm emission maxima. Inhibitory concentration of 50 IC was determined by taking the average of triplicate wells and comparing average relative fluorescence units to the DMSO control. An average of n 3 replicate experiments was used to determine ICvalues. See IC 7 nM .

This assay also may be used assess the effect of compounds on proliferation of fibroblasts and murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. The results of the assay for assessing the effect of paclitaxel on proliferation of murine RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line were shown in IC 134 nM .

WISTAR rats weighing g are anesthetized by the intramuscular injection of lnnovar 0.33 ml kg . Once sedated they are then placed under Halothane anesthesia. After general anesthesia is established fur over the neck region is shaved the skin clamped and swabbed with betadine. A vertical incision is made over the left carotid artery and the external carotid artery exposed. Two ligatures are placed around the external carotid artery and a transverse arteriotomy is made. A number 2 FRENCH FOGART balloon catheter is then introduced into the carotid artery and passed into the left common carotid artery and the balloon is inflated with saline. The catheter is passed up and down the carotid artery three times. The catheter is then removed and the ligature is tied off on the left external carotid artery.

Paclitaxel 33 in ethelyne vinyl acetate EVA is then injected in a circumferential fashion around the common carotid artery in ten rats. EVA alone is injected around the common carotid artery in ten additional rats. The paclitaxel may also be coated onto an EVA film which is then placed in a circumferential fashion around the common carotid artery. Five rats from each group are sacrificed at 14 days and the final five at 28 days. The rats are observed for weight loss or other signs of systemic illness. After 14 or 28 days the animals are anesthetized and the left carotid artery is exposed in the manner of the initial experiment. The carotid artery is isolated fixed at 10 buffered formaldehyde and examined for histology.

A statistically significant reduction in the degree of initimal hyperplasia as measured by standard morphometric analysis indicates a drug induced reduction in fibrotic response.
