This application is a division of U.S. application Ser. No. 10 889 169 filed Jul. 13 2004 and claims priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Appln. No. 60 486 435 filed Jul. 14 2003.

This invention was made with U.S. government support under grant number EAR 0135626 from the National Science Foundation. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to diamonds and more particularly to a tough diamond produced using Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition MPCVD within a deposition chamber.

Large scale production of synthetic diamond has long been an objective of both research and industry. Diamond in addition to its gem properties is the hardest known material has the highest known thermal conductivity and is transparent to a wide variety of electromagnetic radiation. It is valuable because of its wide range of applications in a number of industries in addition to its value as a gemstone. However a diamond can have low fracture toughness that will makes it unsuitable for many applications such as a high impact machine tools.

For at least the last twenty years a process of producing small quantities of diamond by chemical vapor deposition CVD has been available. As reported by B. V. Spitsyn et al. in Vapor Growth of Diamond on Diamond and Other Surfaces Journal of Crystal Growth vol. 52 pp. 219 226 the process involves CVD of diamond on a substrate by using a combination of methane or another simple hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen gas at reduced pressures and temperatures of 800 1200 C. The inclusion of hydrogen gas prevents the formation of graphite as the diamond nucleates and grows. Growth rates of up to 1 m hour have been reported with this technique.

Subsequent work for example that of Kamo et al. as reported in Diamond Synthesis from Gas Phase in Microwave Plasma Journal of Crystal Growth vol. 62 pp. 642 644 demonstrated the use of Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition MPCVD to produce diamond at pressures of 1 8 Kpa in temperatures of 800 1000 C. with microwave power of 300 700 W at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. A concentration of 1 3 methane gas was used in the process of Kamo et al. Maximum growth rates of 3 m hour have been reported using this MPCVD process.

In the above described processes and in a number of more recently reported processes the fracture toughness of the diamonds is better in some instances than natural diamond. In particular higher growth rate processes that only produce or grow polycrystalline forms of diamond are known to produce diamond having a fracture toughness higher than natural diamond. Other than some high pressure high pressure HPHT synthetic diamonds which have been annealed most diamonds have a fracture toughness of less than 11 MPa m.

Accordingly the present invention is directed to a an apparatus and a method for producing diamond that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.

An object of the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for producing diamond in a microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition system having increased fracture toughness.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.

To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention as embodied and broadly described a single crystal diamond grown by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition has a hardness of 50 90 GPa and a fracture toughness of 15 20 MPa m.

In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention a method for growing a single crystal diamond includes placing a seed diamond in a holder and growing single crystal diamond at a temperature of about 1000 C. to about 1100 C. such that the single crystal diamond has a fracture toughness of 11 20 MPa m.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention the results of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

The microwave plasma CVD grown single crystal diamond referred to in this application were grown with the apparatus described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 288 499 filed on Nov. 6 2002 entitled Apparatus and Method for Diamond Production which is hereby incorporated by reference. In general a seed diamond is placed in holder that moves the seed diamond grown diamond as the diamond is grown. The inventors of this application are also inventors in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 288 499.

A microwave plasma CVD grown single crystal diamond having a thickness of greater than 1 millimeter was deposited on type Ib 100 synthetic diamond. In order to enhance the growth rate 50 150 m h and promote smooth 100 face growth single crystal diamonds were grown in an atmosphere of N CH 0.2 5.0 CH H 12 20 120 220 torr total pressure and 900 1500 C. from a microwave induced plasma within a CVD chamber. Raman spectra show a small amount of hydrogenated amorphous carbon a C H and nitrogen containing a C H N a C H giving rise to brown diamond at 1400 C. Photoluminescence PL spectra indicate nitrogen vacancy N V impurities. Single crystal diamonds up to 4.5 mm in thickness have been fabricated at growth rates that are as much as two orders of magnitude higher than conventional polycrystalline CVD growth methods.

The indenter applies a point load to the test diamond until an indentation or crack is formed in the test diamond . To prevent elastic deformation of the indenter the loads were varied from 1 to 3 kg on 100 faces in the direction of the test diamonds. is a picture of an indentation made on a microwave plasma CVD grown single crystal diamond. Dimensions of the indentation and the cracks associate with the indentation are measured via optical microscopy.

By measuring the length D and height h of the indentation the hardness Hof the test diamond can be determined from the following equation 1 1.854 1 P is the maximum load used on the indenter to form an indentation into the test diamond. D is the length of the longest crack formed by the indenter in the test diamond and h is the depth of the indentation into the test diamond as shown in .

The fracture toughness Kof the test diamond can be determined by using the hardness Hfrom equation 1 in the following equation 2 0.016 0.004 2 E is the Young s modulus which is assumed to be 1000 GPa. P is the maximum load used on the indenter to form the indentation into the test diamond. The term d is the average length of the indentation cavity in the test diamond as shown in such that d d d 2. The term c is the average length of the radial cracks in the test diamond as shown in such the c c c 2.

The differences in fracture toughness for the microwave plasma CVD grown single crystal diamonds represented in appeared somewhat to correlate with processing temperature. Accordingly the present inventors grew additional microwave plasma CVD grown single crystal diamonds within specific processing temperature ranges. In other words a seed diamond was placed in a holder and single crystal diamond was grown within a specified processing temperature range. These additional microwave plasma CVD grown single crystal diamonds were then subjected to the same hardness and fracture toughness testing.

Although growth rate of the single crystal diamonds are slower a single crystal diamonds 1000 C. 1100 C. can be produced having a high fracture toughness of 18 20 MPa m. No other diamonds synthetic or natural have been reported as having such a high fracture toughness. Further diamonds grown at higher temperatures such as 1150 C. 1350 C. may not necessarily achieve a high fracture toughness but tend to have a high hardness that makes such diamonds useful for other purposes.

As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof it should also be understood that the above described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description unless otherwise specified but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.
