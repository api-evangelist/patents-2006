The present invention relates to methods of associating program content data in digital television networks for controlling program content data flow within the networks. Moreover the present invention also concerns digital television networks operable to execute such methods of associating program content. Furthermore the present invention relates to software products executable on computing hardware for implementing said methods of associating program content data.

Television broadcasting systems are well known for providing program content to users. Broadcasting organizations are responsible for generating the program content. Two financial models substantially pertain to operation of the broadcasting organizations. In a first financial model users pay the broadcasting organizations for a right to receive and consume the program content such payment is conveniently made by way of subscription or Pay to View . In a second financial model advertisers pay the broadcasting organizations to include advertisements in the program content which pays for the cost of preparing and transmitting the program content to users.

Conventional television broadcasting systems are operable to transmit specific program content pursuant to program time schedules. Such program schedules are inconvenient because users are obliged to consume the program content at its time of transmission. In order to address such inconvenience users have for many years employed video recorders to record program content to enable subsequent watching of program content at a later time than that of its transmission to the users. Such video recorders enable users to employ fast forward or fast reverse functions of the recorders to skip over advertisements which are not of user interest. Such a manner of behavior is of concern to advertisers paying for their advertisements to be included in the program content broadcast pursuant to the aforesaid second financial model.

Recently more sophisticated types of video recorder have been developed. In a U.S. patent application no. US 2005 0132418 TIVO there is described a multimedia time warping system indicated generally by in . The system allows a user thereof to store selected television broadcast programs while the user is simultaneously watching or reviewing another program. Conveniently the system is similar in size to a conventional video recorder. The system accepts television input streams in a multitude of forms to an input module which converts the input streams to an MPEG encoded formatted stream for internal transfer via a media switch within the system . Events are recorded in the system that indicate the type of program component that has been found where it is located in a data storage device of the system and when it was transmitted. Program logic for example a computer processing unit CPU of the system is notified that an event has occurred and that corresponding data can be selectively extracted from data buffers of the system for selective storage on the data storage device of the system . The system further includes a decoder for converting encoded streams stored within the system to a television output signal for user presentation on a contemporary television display . The system provides user control commands which enable the user to view stored programs with at least the following functions reverse fast forward play pause index fast slow reverse play and fast slow play. Such facilities enable the user to effectively avoid having to view advertisements.

As a further advance to the system it is proposed that the program logic is provided with software for performing automatic editing of advertisements for example by identifying characteristic fingerprints of program content in comparison to characteristic fingerprints of advertisements and then performing an editing function to automatically remove those portions of received signals corresponding to advertisements. Alternatively such editing can also be potentially performed manually by the user. Such technical developments are of concern to broadcasters and advertisers on account of potentially eroding advertising revenue and advertisement effectiveness.

Recently advertising organizations which have hitherto employed television advertising are progressively switching to other media in which to advertise for example in newspapers via the Internet and by telephone sales. In consequence television broadcasting organizations operating pursuant to the aforesaid second financial model are experiencing shortfalls of revenue.

Thus the technical problem at least partially addressed by the present invention is to adapt television broadcasting networks so that users are again obliged to view advertising material in a manner which provides benefits to organizations paying for their advertisements to be distributed to television users.

An object of the present invention is to provide a digital television network which is more effectively capable of presenting advertisement program content to one or more users coupled to the network.

In the accompanying drawings an underlined number is employed to represent an item over which the underlined number is positioned or an item to which the underlined number is adjacent. A non underlined number relates to an item identified by a line linking the non underlined number to the item. When a number is non underlined and accompanied by an associated arrow the non underlined number is used to identify a general item at which the arrow is pointing.

In overview the present invention is concerned with methods of associating program content in digital television networks for example with methods of associating advertisement program content Pwith user profiles Z expressed as user metadata UMD and or film program content P. Such digital television networks are operable to supply data for example via the Internet although additionally or alternatively other types of network operable to communicate data can be employed. When implementing the present invention the Internet or similar is utilized in a peer to peer manner to provide program content P to a user U without causing overload at a principal server S conveniently referred as being a back end server at which the program content P originates. The program content P is propagated in discrete data blocks B from the principal server S to several nodes N in the Internet for storage thereat. The several nodes N are beneficially configured as supernodes coupled in communication with associated data storage nodes wherein each supernode maintains a record of data blocks stored in its associated data storage nodes. Each data block B is at least partially in encrypted form and accompanied by an identifier I uniquely identifying the block B. The user U desirous to receive program content P interrogates the principal server S to identify program content P which is available on the Internet namely corresponding to the discrete data blocks B which have been propagated within the Internet the principal server S provides the user U with a list of available program content P and the user U responds by sending a request R to the principal server S for specific program content Pdesired by the user U. The principal server S then responds to the request R from the user U by sending a cue list Q corresponding to the specific program content Pto the user U the cue list Q includes identifiers Iof the discrete data blocks Bconstituting the specific program content P. Moreover the cue list Q is beneficially customized in response to characteristics of the user profile Z. The user U executes the cue list Q by sending block requests Rfor the discrete data blocks Bconstituting the specific program content Pinto the Internet to the several nodes N which have received the discrete data blocks B propagated earlier from the principal server S requests are received at the aforesaid supernodes included in the nodes N. On receiving via the Internet the block requests Rfrom the user U the supernodes of the several nodes N are then operable to search their local data storage and their associated data storage nodes to determine whether or not one or more data blocks B stored thereat correspond to the data block requests Rreceived at the several nodes N. If a match is found between the data block requests Rand data blocks B stored at the several nodes N one or more of the nodes N are operable to send one or more requested data blocks Bto the user U for decryption and then consumption thereat. Such a method of providing program content P is of benefit in that the principal server S can deliver data blocks B into the several nodes N of the Internet asynchronously to activities at the user U thereby avoiding data supply overload problems at the principal server S. Moreover interaction between the user U and the principal server S involves relatively little data exchange namely substantially a list of available program content P the cue list Q and the user profile Z. Additionally no program content is sent directly except in exceptional circumstances from the principal server S via the Internet to the user U as such this fundamentally differentiates the present invention from contemporary streamed program content approaches to deliver television services.

Thus such an approach to program content supply via the Internet in a peer to peer manner as described in overview above at least partially addresses problems encountered in aforementioned known approaches to streaming data when providing television services especially user customized television services. By addressing bandwidth issues which represent a major limitation in contemporary streamed digital television systems it becomes possible to deliver program content which is adapted to individual users in a customized manner. In particular it is feasible to at least partially customize advertisement program content Pto tastes and characteristics of individual users U for example to user profiles Z and or to film program content Pwhich the users U select to view. In customizing such advertisement program content P there is a requirement in the network to associate metadata associated with advertisement program content Pto one or more of metadata of film program content P user profiles Z as defined by user profile metadata UMD. A method of associating metadata representative of program content suitable for employing when operating the network will be described in more detail later. However it will be appreciated that alternative approaches to associating metadata presently employed in for example Internet search engines are capable of being adapted to be used in the network for metadata matching purposes.

In the cue list Q the principal server S can include advertisement program content Pcorresponding to advertisement subject matter which has also been delivered from the principal server S for propagation within the Internet. Thus the principal server S can specify in the cue list Q a preferred type of advertisement to be presented to the user U for example in response to a user profile Z being supplied from the user U to the principal server S. Beneficially the user profile Z is anonymous so that the principal server S is unaware of the real name and address A of the user U. In such a manner advertisers advertisement material can be customized to the user U to provide purchase propositions which are more likely to interest the user U in contradistinction to untargeted advertising as used in conventional television broadcasts via UHF or satellite links.

The present invention will now be described in more detail. Referring next to an embodiment of the invention is illustrated as a digital television network indicated generally by . The digital television network is also susceptible to being regarded as a digital television system. The network comprises the Internet or similar type of network denoted by including the principal server S denoted by . The principal server S is coupled to receive film program content Pdenoted by from organizations such as film producers from national television companies from independent film producers and from film archives and similar. The film program content Ptherefore includes for example movies films documentaries sports coverage news reports cartoons and similar. Moreover the principal server S is also coupled to receive advertising program content Pdenoted by from advertising organizations from specialist interest groups such as religious organizations and similar. The program content Pthus comprises advertisements and promotional subject matter.

As described earlier the principal server S is operable to deliver program content P in the form of encrypted data blocks B via communication links provided in the Internet . An example method employed within the network to encrypt the data blocks B will be elucidated in more detail later.

In the user U is denoted by a user node . The user node is susceptible to being implemented as a personal computer PC loaded with suitable compatible software a screen of the personal computer being operable to present television images to the user U denoted by . Alternatively the user node is susceptible to being implemented as a local server coupled via a set top box to a conventional television. Such a conventional television can comprise one or more of a cathode ray tube CRT television a flat screen liquid crystal display LCD television a flat screen plasma display television a liquid crystal display LCD a projection television and an organic light emitting diode OLED display television. On account of data blocks Brequested by the user U potentially being received at the user node in any order from the nodes N and at imprecisely defined times as a result of peer to peer operation of the network the user node includes at least one data storage buffer therein for example a hard disc drive HDD an optical data storage drive and or solid state memory for storing such received data blocks B.

The user U is optionally capable of loading user program content into his her user node and sending such content to the principal server S known also as the back end server . Such user program content will be elucidated in more detail later and includes user profile Z information expressed in user metadata UMD.

Operation of the digital television network will now be described in greater detail with reference to . Operators of the principal server S comprise persons generally responsible for administering the network the persons responsible for the network do not have control of the user U who remains essentially anonymous to these persons. These persons interface with program content providers regarding licensing and procurement of the film program content P from various suppliers for example film producing companies film licensing companies film archives television broadcast corporations and similar. Such licensing and procurement beneficially is in full compliance with international copyright provisions for example with provisions of the Berne Convention. The persons administering the network also interface with advertising organizations for procuring the advertising program content P. These advertising organizations pay for example the persons responsible for the digital television network to target the advertisement program content P dependent upon one or more of the following constraints 

The network is operable such that the principal server S propagates application software AS throughout the Internet in response to user U request for example by way of Internet registration to the system by such users U sending their user profiles Z to the principal server and or paying a fee to receive credit tokens T. Alternatively registration to the network can be optionally free to users U. Beneficially the principal server S is supported by a function such as contemporary secure Pay Pal or similar payment system operable to support secure payment via the Internet . On receipt of such application software AS at the user node the user U is capable of receiving program content from the Internet propagated from the principal server S .

As elucidated in the foregoing the network is operable to cause propagation of the film program content Pand the advertisement program content Pfrom the principal server S throughout the Internet to one or more of the nodes N whereat the program contents P Pare stored as the aforesaid encrypted data blocks B. Such propagation is performed in a peer to peer manner wherein the principal server S optionally is not able to control an extent and manner of propagation of the data blocks B within the network . Moreover such peer to peer propagation is in clear contradistinction to conventional television systems operable to utilize data streaming substantially from central servers to users. Each data block B as denoted by in beneficially comprises several components parts including when decrypted 

Beneficially data blocks B which are only relevant to a particular geographical region for example advertisement program content Pconveying information regarding a particular restaurant or theater in Tokyo in Japanese language are propagated only to those nodes N serving that particular geographical region rather than generally unnecessarily occupying data storage space within the network in regions where Japanese as a language is generally not known and understood.

Initially when the user U is desirous to subscribe to the network the user U contacts the principal server S for example a sub server thereof configured to deal with new enrolments via a Universal Resource Locator URL the user U then proceeds to provide a user profile Z although the user U refrains from providing any personal details such as real name or residential address so that the user U remains in reality anonymous to the network such anonymity is important in the network to respect personal privacy of the user U . As an example the actual user is a middle aged female living in Scotland parading in her user profile Z supplied to the principal server S as a teenage male allegedly living in London. The user profile Z is preferably provided by the user U selecting various options from a menu list presented to the user U there is thereby automatically generated user metadata UMD namely the aforesaid user profile Z expressed in metadata terms in a standardized format corresponding to the user U . Such standardized form for the user metadata UMD is susceptible to rendering the aforesaid program content P Pmore efficiently matched to the user metadata UMD.

On providing the user profile metadata UMD the principal server S is operable to cause the application software AS to be downloaded from the principal server S or another server of the network tasked with providing the user U with software for example one or more of the nodes N for example supernodes or data storage nodes associated therewith are able to provide the user U with a download of the application software AS. Optionally the user U can purchase tokens T from the principal server S or another server of the network when downloading the application software AS alternatively the user U can periodically buy such tokens T via the user node once the application software AS has been loaded into the user node and is executing on computing hardware therein for example on a personal computer PC . The user U is also provided with at least one public password WP namely K complementary to a corresponding private password employed by the principal server S in encrypting the data blocks B . By such an arrangement the user U only has potential access to the data blocks B under supervision of a cue list Q provided from the principal server S once the user U has registered with the principal server S .

On executing the application software AS the user node is optionally initially provided with advertisement program content Pwhich the application software AS is programmed to seek locally in the network to the user node . Such seeking occurs by the user node sending requests for free advertisement program content Pstored substantially locally thereto.

The user U as a next step sends a request enquiry EN to the principal server S for a list of film program content Pavailable within the network . The principal server S responds by sending an electronic program guide EPG derived from metadata stored within the principal server S optionally the electronic program guide EPG is customized to characteristics of the user profile metadata UMD for example when the UMD specifies that the user U is German speaking the electronic program guide EPG is provided in German and pertains substantially to German items of program content P P. By such a selective electronic program guide EPG it is feasible to limit an amount data that the principal server S or another server of the network tasked by the principal server S with providing the electronic program guide EPG to the user U has to provide to the user U thereby avoiding exceeding data bandwidth restrictions at the principal server S . Selective generation of the electronic program guide EPG pursuant to the user profile metadata UMD is executed by metadata matching between metadata associated with the program content Pand that of the user profile metadata UMD. Such metadata matching will be elucidated in more detail later and enables program content lists in the electronic program guide EPG to be presented via the user node to the user U in an order to potential relevance to assist the user U with selecting program content Pmost likely to be of interest the electronic program guide EPG beneficially includes principal channels ad hoc channels which can be user modified and or user created and in fill advertising channels. For example the electronic program guide EPG can be determined for example in respect of one or more of 

Optionally the aforesaid electronic program guide EPG is presented to the user U as screen icons or as lists of potentially relevant program content to the user U based on the user profile Z. More optionally the electronic program guide EPG is presented as a multiplicity of channels amongst which the user U is able to select in a manner akin to channels in contemporary broadcast television. On receiving the electronic program guide EPG the user U selects program content which the user U is desirous to consume and sends such selection as a request REQ to the principal server S . The principal server S then in response to receiving the request REQ sends the aforementioned cue list Q back to the user U . The cue list Q is beneficially generated at the principal server S from one or more channel templates which are then customized namely populated with program content likely to be of relevance or interest to the user U as will be elucidated in more detail below.

The cue list Q includes a list of encrypted data blocks B corresponding to the request REQ the list preferably being in a sequence corresponding to its temporal execution the cue list Q includes thus a list of aforementioned data blocks Bto be requested by the user node . Moreover the principal server S is operable to perform the aforesaid matching of advertising program data Pmetadata with the user profile Z namely the user profile metadata UMD and include a list of data blocks B corresponding to advertisements likely to be interest to the user U namely advertisements specifically targeted to the user U such targeted advertising is in stark contradistinction to conventional broadcast television wherein advertisements are included irrespective of characteristics of viewers. The principal server S is thus also able to determine a manner in which the advertisements are to be presented to the user U for example before and or after film program content Prequested in the request REQ and or interspersed within one or more sections of the film program content Prequested. Optionally the principal server S includes within the cue list Q a complement of all likely relevant advertising program content Pfor the user which the user node is operable to select or reject locally based upon execution of the code included in the data blocks Brequested. The cue list Q may for example contain definitions for data blocks B which are subject to payment from the user U such payment can be made by the principal server S cancelling a certain number of the aforesaid tokens T allocated to the user U . Alternatively or additionally the cue list Q includes data blocks B for which no payment is necessary namely cost free to the user U .

The user node receives the cue list Q from the principal server S and then proceeds to interpret the cue list Q. In interpreting the cue list Q the user node sends out requests to the nodes N for example to the supernodes thereof for the data blocks B. The nodes N substantially in parallel without causing data load to the principal server S search for the requested data blocks B and then report to the user node U whereat the data blocks Bare stored so that the user node U can then specifically request from nodes N whereat the data blocks Bare stored to send the data blocks Bvia the Internet to the user node whereat they are stored in one or more data buffers or data storage of the user node . Thereafter optionally concurrently to receiving the requested data blocks Bfrom the nodes N the application software AS executing upon computing hardware of the user node decrypts the received data blocks B using suitable keys provided to the user U to generate decrypted program content for consumption by the user U . Decryption optionally occurs real time at a time of consumption of the program content by the user U .

Such a manner of providing program content P Pto the user node via the nodes N is highly beneficial in that the principal server S does not need to stream program content in real time as required in known conventional cable television systems. Such a manner of operation considerably reduces a computation workload experienced by the principal server S . Moreover delivery of data blocks B from the principal server S to the nodes N is beneficially implemented during periods when the Internet is more lightly loaded for example at night time.

The network is optionally provided with a purging function to prevent data storage of the nodes N become progressively saturated with data blocks B delivered from the principal server S to the nodes N . For example the nodes N are operable to store each data block B received thereat for a certain time interval before deleting the received data block B from their data storage. Optionally if a given one or more data blocks B are accessed frequently by users U the data blocks B are preferentially not purged from the nodes N . Yet more optionally the code associated with each data block B includes information instructing the nodes N to retain the data block B in data storage for a defined time interval and or until a defined end date. More optionally the received data blocks B are deleted from data storage of the nodes N after the received data blocks B have been accessed by users U a defined number of times.

Beneficially the nodes N are operable to monitor and record a number of times given data blocks B are accessed especially when such data blocks B relate to advertising program content P. Such monitoring and recording is beneficial in that the nodes N for example the supernodes thereat are able to execute one or more of 

The principal server S is thereby capable of providing statistical reports of advertising effectiveness or exposure directly to advertisers paying for advertisement program content Pto be presented via the network and therefore enabling the effectiveness of advertising campaigns to be assessed on a substantially real time basis.

Optionally the electronic program guide EPG as processed via the application software AS executing on the computing hardware of the user node is presented to the user U as one or more channels between which the user U can select namely in a manner akin to known conventional television broadcasting systems. Yet more optionally the application software AS is operable via for example an Application Programming Interface API to allow the user U to upload the user s program content together with its metadata to the principal server S . Such uploading of the data content is optionally subject to a payment from the user U to the principal server S for example in a situation wherein the program content corresponds to private advertisement material for example classified small advertisements. The persons responsible for operation of the principal server S are beneficially operable to review the program content submitted by the user U for ensuring that the metadata provided by the user U is consistent with the program content subject matter and also that the program content is of nature that it can respectfully be propagated within the network for example the persons responsible for the network are able to potentially hinder propagation of the program content which is susceptible to causing incitement to criminal activities and such like.

The cue list Q provided to the user U is capable of enabling the user U via the application software AS to review the requested program content REQ namely the requested data blocks B in fast forward fast reverse forward reverse and stop modes akin to a conventional video recorder.

Optionally in an event that a requested data block Bincluded in the cue list Q is not found at any of the nodes N by their associated supernodes the application software AS is operable in such a situation to send a request directly to the principal server S for the requested data block B. In response the principal server S executes at least one of the following operations 

Optionally the principal server S is operable to propagate duplicate data blocks B within the network in response to estimated frequency of access by users U. For example data blocks B corresponding to sports coverage program content are beneficially duplicated to more nodes N at weekends in comparison to data blocks B corresponding to obscure documentary films. Such selective distribution of duplicate data blocks B enables data supply overload occurring at the nodes N to be circumvented. Yet more optionally in an event of given program content P Pbecome unexpectedly very popular for example a given amusing advertisement or comedy film the nodes N are optionally operable to propagate corresponding data blocks B to other nodes N of the network so that data supply overload from the nodes N to users U does not occur and that a high quality of service to users U is thereby provided.

As elucidated in the foregoing the application software AS executable at the user node U is beneficially synergistically capable of accessing other services available on the Internet for example one or more of voice over Internet Protocol VoIP instant messaging electronic product auctioning such as provided by E bay banking services such as Pay Pal and user directories capable of bring the user U into contact with other users U of the network . Such user contacts are beneficially not monitored or recorded at the principal server S so as to respect privacy and anonymity of the users U of the network . As elucidated in the foregoing the user profiles Z as represented in the user metadata UMD do not include actual names and postal addresses of the users U thereby ensuring their anonymity.

In customizing presentation of the advertisement program content Pto the user U the principal server S is operable to perform metadata matching as will now be elucidated in further detail. In overview such metadata matching involves determining one or more Euclidean distances E between one or more terms present in user profile metadata UMD corresponding to the aforesaid user profile Z and one or more terms present in film program content metadata FMD corresponding to the film program content Pand or advertisement program content metadata AMD corresponding to the advertisement program content P the one or more Euclidean distances are summated in order to determine a total value of a matching factor MF. Computation of the one or more Euclidean distances E optionally involves filtering the metadata UMD FMD AMD to remove terms imparting negligible information followed by a translation step for example to an abstract conceptual language domain wherefrom the one or more Euclidean distances E are determined. Moreover the computation also involves filtering incorrectly spelt terms by substituting them with correspondingly correctly spelt terms. In an event of the total value of matching factor MFexceeding a given threshold T an association is deemed to have been made. When the association concerns film program content P a recommendation for example in the aforesaid electronic program guide EPG is optionally made to the user based on substantially a matching factor MF. Conversely when the association concerns advertisement program content P the advertisement program content Pis beneficially presented to the user U at a suitable instance based on at least one of matching factors MF MF. The suitable instance depends upon a nature of film program content Pto be presented to the user U in close temporal proximity to the advertisement program content P. Thus matching of film program content Pdescribed by film metadata FMD to the user profile Z described by the user metadata UMD is defined by Equation 1 Eq. 1 

Similarly matching of advertising program content Pdescribed by advertisement metadata AMD to the user profile Z described by the user metadata UMD is defined by Equation 2 Eq. 2 

Similarly matching of advertising program content Pdescribed by advertisement metadata AMD to the film program content Pdescribed by the film metadata FMD is defined by Equation 3 Eq. 3 

A matching of advertisement program content Pto both the user profile Z and the film profile data Pcan be derived from a function F having the matching factors MF MF MFas input parameters thereto as described by Equation 4 Eq. 4 delivering the total value of matching factor MF MF MF MF MF Eq. 4 In its simple implementation the function F is a multiplication product or a summation product of one or more of its input parameters namely one or more of the matching factors MF MF MF. In a more general case the function F is implemented as a multi term polynomial function with one or more of the matching factors MF MF MFbeing input parameters to such a multi term polynomial. In an event of the matching factors MF MF MF and thus MFcomputed from Equation 4 exceeding the aforementioned threshold T associations are deemed to have occurred. Conversely when the matching factors MF MF MFand thus and thus MFare less than the threshold T associations are deemed not to have occurred. Optionally computation of the total value of matching factor MFcan employ any one of more of the matching factors MF MF MF namely it is not always necessary for the series of processing steps to compute all of the matching factors in computing the total value of matching factor MF.

In there is shown a representation of some of the aforesaid Euclidean distances Erequired for determining the matching factor MF. A similar representation for the matching factor MFcan also be constructed. Terms tto tin the user metadata UMD are a sub set of key information bearing words which are filtered from a total complement of words present in the user metadata UMD. Similarly terms wto win the advertisement program content metadata AMD are a sub set of key information bearing words which are filtered from a total complement of words present in the advertisement metadata AMD. Such filtering beneficially includes one or more spell checks for checking for mis spelt terms or words. Moreover such filtering can optionally be performed in one or more of the following ways 

The Euclidean distances E are not real spatial distances but rather effectively a probability of association for example a term horse may have a shorter Euclidean distance namely higher probability of association to a term pony than to a term arachnid whereas a term motorbike may have a relatively longer Euclidean distance namely lower probability of association to a term food mixer than to a term wheel and whereas James Bond may have a relatively shorter Euclidean distance namely higher probability of association to a term sports car than to university academic .

The Euclidean distances E and their associated metadata terms are preferably maintained in a database associated with the principal server S or otherwise accessible from an external database coupleable to the principal server S . Moreover optionally the database of Euclidean distances E and their respective metadata terms can remain substantially constant with time namely not updated with time.

Alternatively in an advanced implementation of the present invention the Euclidean distances E are modified as a function of response of the user U to being presented with advertisement program content P. In other words in an event of the principal server S when generating the aforesaid cue list Q to send to the user node makes an unsuitable association of advertisement program content Pto the user profile Z the user U in being presented the advertisement program content Pelects to skip viewing the advertisement content P the system is operable to provide feedback to the principal server S to marginally increase the Euclidean distances E linking filtered terms of the user profile metadata UMD to filtered terms of the advertisement program content metadata AMD namely updating the aforesaid Euclidean distance database. Beneficially such modification of the Euclidean distance database is performed in response to general aforesaid statistical information regarding advertising effectiveness collated within the network for providing advertising effectiveness feedback to the advertisers responsible for providing the advertisement program content Pto the principal server S . Such a feedback mechanism is illustrated in . Optionally in addition or as an alternative to modifying Euclidean distances as function of user U responses the principal server S can modify the user profile Z stored thereat to obtain better matching of metadata terms.

Referring to there is shown a series of operations indicated generally by executable in the network for modifying the aforesaid Euclidean distances E in a feedback manner to improve matching of advertisement program content Pto the user profile Z and to film program content P. The series of operations comprise a first function performed at the principal server S to compute a matching factor MFof film program content Pin relation to the user profile Z the function referring to Euclidean distances E stored in a Euclidean distance database EDB the function includes filters FLT for filtering metadata terms conveying negligible information and or performing a language translation as elucidated earlier and or performing a spelling correction function. Moreover the series of operations comprise a second function also performed at the principal server S to compute a matching factor MFof advertisement program content Pin relation to the user profile Z the function also referring to Euclidean distances E stored in a Euclidean distance database EDB similarly the function includes filters FLT for filtering metadata terms conveying negligible information and or performing a language translation as elucidated earlier and or performing a spell check and spelling correction. The matching factors MF MFare then merged in a step as denoted by using the function F of Equation 4 to generate the total value of matching factor MF. In a function the total value of matching factor MFis compared with the aforementioned threshold T. In an event that the total matching factor MFis equal to or less than the threshold T namely route N a match of metadata is deemed not to have been found and the advertisement program content Pis then not included in the cue list Q and a return to other computation tasks is then performed in the principal sever S conversely in an event that the total matching factor MFis greater than the threshold T namely route Y a match of metadata is deemed to have been found and the principal server S is then operable to include the program content Pin the cue list Q subject to rule control denoted by concerning suitable placement of the advertisement program content P. The rule control takes into account for example one or more of the following 

When a metadata match is identified at the function identifiers for corresponding data blocks B are included in the list Q being generated at the principal server S on completion the cue list Q is then sent to the user U . As elucidated in the foregoing the user U is operable to obtain film program content Pand advertisement program content Pfrom the nodes N of the network as identified in the cue list Q.

When executing the cue list Q received at the user node U to present program content to the user U the user node receives data blocks Bat the user node and then stores them in its data store or memory. The user node is operable to fetch the data blocks. B to check whether or not the data blocks B can be presented to the user U based upon rules included in the code included within the data blocks B for example in response to an ambient temperature in the user U s environs exceeding 25 C.

In a step denoted by the user node is operable to record one or more responses of the user U to being presented the advertisement program content Pconveyed in the data blocks Bsupplied in response to executing the cue list Q. The response is preferably recorded as one of 

The series of operations can be modified so that a match is only established between the user profile Z and the film program content Pfor purposes of generating an electronic program guide EPG to the user U from the principal server S in other words the matching factor MFis primarily used for generating the total value of matching factor MFfor comparing with the threshold T. In such a situation where matching to advertisement program content Pis not required for generating an electronic program guide EPG customized to the user U the functions are then not invoked.

The network is therefore capable of actively updating in an automatic feedback manner its Euclidean distance database EDB to provide for a better targeted service to the user U . Such better targeting is susceptible to rendering the network more enjoyable to utilize in comparison to contemporary broadcast UHF and satellite television services. Moreover the network is capable of functioning as a feedback self optimizing tool for precisely targeting advertisements to users U in a manner hitherto not achieved in contemporary uni directional digital television services. Moreover such extraordinarily attractive performance is achieved in the network with modest bandwidth on account of data blocks B being propagated in a peer to peer manner therein. On account of its degree of automation the network is capable of targeting advertisements to the users U without a high input of human effort. However the network retains an option of targeting of advertisement program content Pbeing manually controlled for example by manual amendment of advertisement metadata AMD to address special requirements demanded by advertisers providing the advertisement program content P. Unlike other media conveying advertisements to users U the network is able to automatically collate statistical information regarding success of exposure of given advertisement program content Pto users U and thereby provide rapid reports of advertising campaign success to providers of the advertisement program content P.

Modifications to embodiments of the invention described in the foregoing are possible without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the accompanying claims.

The series of operations illustrated in are susceptible to being further modified to refine a degree of matching achieved in the step to determine sensitivities of Euclidean distances employed in computing the matching factors MF MF MFand hence the total value of matching factor MF. In practice it is found that certain terms that are filtered and or translated from metadata for example from metadata UMD FMD AMD and which are employed in determining Euclidean distances can disproportionately contribute to computation of the matching factors MF MF MF. Such disproportionate contribution can result in potentially less suitable automatic inclusion of the advertisement program content Pin the cue list Q or less suitable selection of film program content Pin electronic program guides EPGs presented to the user U . Beneficially the step can be further refined by computing a sensitivity to change as one or more of the filtered and or translated metadata terms for example one or more of the terms tto tand or wto w are substituted with substantially equivalent terms as determined by an electronic Thesaurus or similar type of word equivalents database. Optionally actual names are not subject to such identification of equivalent terms on account of names being specific to certain actors and so forth.

As an example the advertisement metadata AMD may be initially in Danish language and include a term knallert and a term og . The metadata AMD is translated to English so that terms knallert and og become translated by moped and and respectively. The filter FLT will remove the word and from the translated metadata on account of it being a commonly occurring word conveying relatively little useful information for matching purposes. The matching factor value MF 1 is then computed using the metadata moped and other filtered and or translated metadata terms derived from the advertisement metadata AMD in conjunction with the translated and or filtered user metadata UMD by way of Euclidean distances E as elucidated in the foregoing. By referring to an electronic Thesaurus or similar database an equivalence for the term moped is then identified for example scooter or small motorcycle and then the matching MF 2 is recalculated. One or more recalculations of the advertisement matching factor MF 1 to MF k wherein k is an integer denoting the number of recalculations can be performed and one or more of the following subsequent steps implemented as follows 

Preferably persons names are not subject to such substitution of equivalent terms on account of the users U often desiring to seek an exact match in respect of such names for example for electronic program guides EPGs based on actor name or film character name. Such refinements are in mathematical terms akin to determining partial derivatives of one or more of the matching factors MF MF MFand thus MFin respect of metadata terms for example

As the meanings of words change new film actors become known politicians appear and disappear from political arenas the Euclidean distance database is not only updated with new terms linked by Euclidean distances but also the Euclidean distances E are updated in response to actions invoked by the user U . Such feedback 

Although dynamic modification of the aforesaid Euclidian distances E is described in the foregoing in response to statistical information gathered from user responses it will be appreciated that at least one of the user metadata UMD the film program content metadata FMD and the advertisement program content metadata AMD is susceptible to being modified in a feedback in response to statistic information gathered from several user responses preferably many users so that a general trend can be established. Thus one or more of Euclidian distances and metadata can be modified to obtain better matching. Such better matching can for example be achieved by applying a perturbation to a term present in advertisement metadata AMD and then observing a corresponding change in user response in an event of a perturbation of metadata enhancing user response and hence user exposure of the corresponding advertisement program content P the principal server S can provide feedback to the advertisement program content provider to seek permission to modify the advertisement program content metadata AMD alternatively for example subject to general approval from the advertisement program content Pprovider the principal server S can automatically iterate the advertisement program content metadata AMD for example by applying sequentially random perturbations in the advertisement meta data AMD and observe and analyze responses from many users U . A similar type of approach can be applied to refine matching for the user metadata UMD. Optionally advertisement program content Pproviders can specify whether or not its advertisement program content metadata AMD is permitted to be modified in the network in such a manner of feedback.

In the foregoing encryption of the data blocks B is elucidated in general overview. However there are several mutually different encryption methods that can potentially be employed in the network . An especially beneficial method involves a mutually different password for encrypting the data blocks B relative to the cue list Q. Referring to there is shown a method indicated generally by illustrating encryption and decryption processes executed within the system . The network includes an encryption key provider for example an additional server of the network operable to generate one or more variants of an encryption key e. The encryption key e is an unpredictable number to third parties coupled to the network . Moreover the network includes a data block encryption unit Fdenoted by coupled in data communication with the principal server S and the encryption key provider . The network further comprises a cue list generator Q operable to generate one or more cue lists Q for sending to the user node .

In operation the data block encryption unit is operable to receive one or more encryption keys ewherein a parameter y is an integer index identifying a variant of the key e from the key provider and apply the encryption keys eto encrypt data blocks B provided thereto from the principal server S to generate corresponding encrypted data blocks e B which are propagated within the network as elucidated earlier in a peer to peer manner. The cue list generator is also operable to receive an identifier Ifrom the principal server S and the encryption key eused to encrypt the data block B corresponding to the identifier I.

Application software AS executing in the computing hardware of the user node is operable to generate a complementary private public key pair comprising a public key Kand a private key K. Optionally the keys K Kare layered as known in encryption systems design. The private key Kis maintained a secret at the user node whereas the public key Kis communicated via the network to the cue list generator . In turn the cue list generator is operable to generate the cue list Q to be a sequence of the identifiers I namely component as illustrated in followed by the encryption keys eemployed in the encryption unit to encrypt data blocks B corresponding to the identifiers I wherein the encryption keys are encrypted in the cue list generator using the public key K. On receipt of the cue list Q at the user node the user node is operable to fully decrypt the Q list using the private key K. Without knowledge of the private key K unauthorized third parties are not able to fully interpret the cue list Q. The user node is thereby able to determine the variant of encryption key eused to encrypt the data block Bcorresponding to its identifier Iand thereby decrypted the encrypted data block e B received in a peer to peer manner from the network for consumption by the user U . Optionally the encryption unit the encryption key provider and the cue list generator are substantially collocated with the principal server S. Alternatively one or more of the encryption unit the encryption key provider and the cue list generator are function distributed within the network .

Multiple variants of the key e are utilized so that the network as a whole is not compromised to hostile third parties should one variant of the key e become known. Optionally in an event of a variant eof the encryption key e being discovered by third parties the network is operable so that the encryption unit and the key provider cease using the variant eto encode data blocks B encoded by the variant eto be progressively purged from the network as elucidated in the foregoing.

Although methods of associated program content data in a digital television network is described in the foregoing it will be appreciated that the methods are susceptible to being employed in other technical fields for example in Internet search engines.

Although program content in the foregoing is employed to refer to advertisement program content Pand film program content P it will be appreciated that the network is also susceptible to distributing audio program content and executable software.
