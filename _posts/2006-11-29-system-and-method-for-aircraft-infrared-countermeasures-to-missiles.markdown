The present invention relates to laser beam pointer devices and more particularly to apparatus and method for infrared countermeasures IRCM to missiles launched against vehicles such as airborne helicopters Navy vessels and Army tanks by quickly determining a direction e.g. toward an incoming missile to which to point a modulated IR laser beam and for directing the laser beam in the determined direction.

Advanced Man Portable Air Defense Systems MANPADS present a significant threat to fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. Mid infrared laser based infrared countermeasures IRCM systems could provide the needed protection from MANPADS for many types of aircraft. Unfortunately with the complex pointer tracker turret assembly these systems typically cost more than 1.5 million. This prohibitively high cost precludes use with large numbers of aircraft leaving them unprotected from advanced MANPADS.

Laser beams can be pointed using a number of methods and mechanisms some which allow aligning the laser beam with a sensor determined direction which is useful for IRCM.

There is a need for a low cost laser pointer system that is much less complex than a conventional pointer tracker turret assembly.

The pointer tracker assembly is also the least reliable component in conventional laser pointer or other IRCM systems. Further the low cost method and apparatus of the present invention use the existing or Common Missile Warning Sensor CMWS or other conventional sensors for tracking what the laser beam should point at e.g. incoming missiles eliminating the costly fine track infrared camera.

Some embodiments further include an ability to sense more than one object and simultaneously direct a plurality of laser beams in a plurality of different directions or sequentially direct a single laser beam in the plurality of different directions one at a time.

Another aspect of the invention in some embodiments is a method that includes providing a first fiber bundle having a plurality of light transmitting fibers including a first fiber a second fiber and a third fiber the first fiber bundle having a first end and a second end generating direction control information based on the direction control information directing laser energy into the first fiber at the first end of the first fiber bundle during a first time period forming an output beam of the laser energy from the second end of the first fiber bundle and steering the output beam of the laser energy from the first fiber in a first selected direction of a plurality of directions during the first time period.

Although the following detailed description contains many specifics for the purpose of illustration a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope of the invention. Accordingly the following preferred embodiments of the invention are set forth without any loss of generality to and without imposing limitations upon the claimed invention.

In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The leading digit s of reference numbers appearing in the Figures generally corresponds to the Figure number in which that component is first introduced such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component which appears in multiple Figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.

In some embodiments the one to one relationship is ensured by bundling and or affixing to one another a plurality of fibers and then cleaving the bundle thus ensuring that each fiber end at one cleaved end corresponds exactly to that fiber at the other cleaved end. In some embodiments a folded or looped i.e. looped to some bend radius that will not break the fiber middle point i.e. somewhere between the two ends of the fiber typically but not necessarily in the exact middle of fiber is threaded from each external aperture on the vehicle e.g. a helicopter or other mobile or fixed platform to the location of receiver transmitter see thus providing two fibers a transmit fiber connected to a receive fiber at the loop or fold point from each external aperture to receiver transmitter . Once all the fibers are connected from their respective external apertures to their folded ends at the receiver transmitter the folded ends are bundled to e.g. a square cross section and cleaved to obtain a receive end bundle and a transmit end bundle each bundle having fiber ends in a mirror corresponding configuration i.e. once cut the fibers across any given row that are left to right on the receiver will correspond to those fibers in a right to left order on the same row of the transmitter . In other embodiments a large number of fibers can be wound e.g. around a large circular form to a length at least as long as the longest fiber routing in the vehicle e.g. 2 meters in some embodiments . Once all the fiber loops are wound the fibers at one point along the circular form are gathered into a bundle e.g. one having a square cross section area and are cleaved to obtain a receive end bundle and a transmit end bundle each having fiber ends in a mirror corresponding configuration i.e. once cut the fibers across any given row that are left to right on the receiver will correspond to those fibers in a right to left order on the same row of the transmitter . At some midpoint between the transmit end and the receive end each fiber is separately routed to its respective external aperture on the vehicle and cleaved at that point to form one fiber that goes to the receive end bundle and another fiber that goes to a mirror corresponding point on the transmit end bundle.

Fiber bundles are commonly used in medical endoscopes where in some embodiments 30 000 fibers are bundled to create a flexible imaging cable. Recent developments e.g. at the Naval Research Laboratory have developed low loss mid infrared transmitting fibers e.g. chalcogenide glass fibers and commercial manufacturers have fabricated mid IR fibers into multi element bundles.

In some embodiments of this design the receiver and transmitter apertures are co located and coupled rigidly to a common structure. Thus any flexing in the platform structure will not lead to misalignment between the receiver and the transmitter.

Although in some embodiments the laser would be capable of producing output with very narrow solid angles the divergence of the laser must be increased to fill the solid angle typical of the MWS imaging sensor to ensure that the target identified within an imaging sensor pixel or cell e.g. an MWS cell is illuminated. Because of the increased laser divergence the power of the laser must be increased to provide a sufficient jamming laser signal strength J S ratio. For certain platforms such as low signature helicopters this approach is feasible due to the relatively low radiant intensity needed to provide sufficient laser signal strength J S ratio to cause the missile to optical break lock or other desired effect on the target object. Beam shaping is used in some embodiments to propagate a flat top intensity profile which improves the efficiency and maintains the laser power requirement at a manageable level.

In some embodiments the invention could enable the hardware cost of an IRCM system for low signature helicopters to be reduced to 1 10the cost of current IRCM systems. shows the overall system concept for a low cost distributed aperture beam steering laser pointer IRCM beam steering system . The invention could enable the hardware cost of a laser pointer system for certain platforms e.g. for low signature helicopters to be reduced to about ten percent of the cost of current laser pointer systems. In some embodiments a plurality e.g. four in some embodiments of sensors e.g. solid state cameras or other suitable imager for one or more wavelengths of interest each points in a different direction from the platform e.g. an aircraft and provide direction parameters to laser scanner unit that outputs a laser beam to one or more fibers of a plurality of fiber bundles e.g. four in some embodiments wherein one or more fibers outputs its light through each transmit lens in some embodiments each transmit fiber s far end has its own lens to point its beam in a particular chosen direction with a chosen beam divergence . In some embodiments system includes a plurality of image sensors e.g. cameras having a suitable wavelength sensitivity speed and field of view and a corresponding number of transmit lenses each coupled to a respective fiber bundle . In some embodiments signals are coupled from the image sensors to mid IR laser scanner system which then generates and modulates a laser signal and directs the laser signal to a selected one of the fibers in fiber bundles in order that an output beam is projected from its transmit lens to the desired direction e.g. a selected azimuth and altitude corresponding to the sensed energy which could be UV visible and or IR .

Another potential system cost saving can be obtained from fiber coupling the mid IR laser to the pointer tracker of a conventional laser pointer tracker system. Fiber coupling allows the Mid IR laser to be isolated from the helicopter platform s vibration thereby reducing the engineering required to harden the laser. Isolating the laser from vibration should also reduce the lifecycle costs by improving the reliability. The most significant cost savings however is present where multiple pointer trackers were required to provide adequate protection with a single remotely located laser being coupled into any pointer tracker. Using a single laser for all bundles precludes or complicates the option of pointing laser beams at multiple objects countering multiple threats simultaneously and in some embodiments this level of complexity can add cost to the system. In some embodiments multiple threats or other objects are addressed serially pointed to in a sequential manner using a single laser. In other embodiments multiple lasers are provided in order to simultaneously address multiple threats or other objects.

The most significant losses are in the fiber coupling and the far field profile. The OPSL output is diffraction limited DL in one direction and 4 to 5 times DL four to five times diffraction limited in the orthogonal direction. In order to produce the required output divergence in the far field assuming a 12.4 mm output aperture some embodiments are limited to a beam quality of two to three times DL. Thus there is a power loss in one dimension when coupling into the fiber. The loss due to the far field profile is a result of the non uniform far field profile. If a Gaussian distribution is produced in the far field with a 1 ediameter of 2 mrad then the intensity at the edge of the field is only 23 that of a uniform distribution of the same size. Nonetheless even with these inefficiencies the laser power required to produce a radiant intensity of 1.67 kW steradian is less than 1 W.

The key to understanding this concept is that there is a one to one correspondence between resolution elements in the receiver and fibers in the transmitter as illustrated in . shows a one to one correspondence between a resolvable spot on the detector array in the receiver aperture and a transmitting fiber in the array making up the fiber bundle in the transmitter aperture. Each resolution element in the detector defines a solid angle in the MWS field of regard. If a threat is detected within that resolution element the laser power is directed into a particular fiber that transmits into that same solid angle. One key aspect of this design is that the receiver and transmitter apertures are co located and coupled rigidly to a common structure. Thus any flexing in the platform structure will not lead to misalignment between the receiver and transmitter.

In some embodiments the divergence of the laser is increased to fill a solid angle equivalent to one pixel of the MWS. The power of the laser must be increased as well to provide a sufficient jam signal. Fortunately because the beam can be many times diffraction limited and still fall within this solid angle a more uniform profile can be transmitted into the far field. shows that a 1 W laser generates a far field radiant intensity of 1.67 kW steradian if a one degree beam divergence is chosen. Researchers at AFRL e.g. see the A. P. Ongstad et al. article cited herein have demonstrated output powers of 14 W at 3.5 microns from an OPSL which would correspond to 11 W at 4.5 microns. Fiber coupling losses are assumed to be very small since in some embodiments the beam is coupled into a fiber having a large mode area core e.g. one having a core of about 250 microns diameter in some embodiments fiber.

The top hat profile is created in the far field by generating a uniform intensity at the end of the fiber and then imaging the end of the fiber bundle into the far field. The key is in producing a uniform intensity over the end of a fiber in a way that is not affected by varying the fiber bundle handling or environment. Nominally the OPSL output will not fill all of the fiber modes and the fiber will probably not be long enough to allow sufficient mode mixing. Applying mechanical stress or shaping the fiber non circular cross section perhaps over a subsection will alter the mode coupling properties and can be used to vary the output profile. Shaping the injected beam changing the intensity or phase profile such that it fills all of the fiber modes can also be used to improve the output uniformity. However since the coupling between modes is determined largely by the defects in the fiber and mid IR fiber was developed only recently the best method for generating a uniform intensity will have to be determined empirically.

The fiber bundle experiment shown in and sends out a red laser output beam that is pointed to track or follow a green spot projected from a green laser pointer onto a wall or screen. In some embodiments the red track beam steps from one location to the next due to the spacing beam divergence and pointing direction of the various fibers as the beam is switched from one fiber to the next in response to the continuous motion of the green laser pointer spot. Using visible wavelengths eases issues with diagnostics and makes the operation of the system even more visible apparent to observers . The field of regard in the experiment in some embodiments is 30 degrees horizontal and vertical. The 1 degree divergence of the track beam would be maintained as is present in some embodiments of the invention. Thus the fiber bundle would contain about nine hundred fibers in a nested square array. In other embodiments other widths of field of regard other solid angle divergences for the individual beams and other numbers of fibers can be used to suit the requirements of a particular installation.

The block diagram of a system for the experiment is shown in . The upper half of the system provides a lab version of an imaging sensor and the image processor . The lower half of provides the track laser the mirrors and lenses for injecting the beam into the fiber bundle the fiber bundle itself and the output lens.

Various embodiments of the invention use various wavelengths for the lasers. In some embodiments mid IR wavelengths e.g. between about 2 microns and about 5 microns are used. In some embodiments the distributed aperture approach of the present invention for a low cost pointer tracker has a mid IR fiber bundle that serves to distribute the laser energy to transmit apertures co located with the imaging sensors. The design of the fiber bundle can have a significant impact on the efficiency of the system as a result of fiber coupling losses because the fiber bundle affects the far field intensity distribution. The efficiency with which laser light is coupled to the target determines the size weight and cost of the laser so it is important to consider the fiber bundle design tradeoffs carefully.

In this section the objectives of the fiber bundle design for some embodiments are laid out and the design considerations are described that result in the choice of important design parameters. Methods are also described for generating uniform spatial intensity at the end of the fiber and coupling the laser light into and out of the fiber bundle.

The design parameters for some embodiments of the fiber bundle with typical values for some embodiments are listed in Table 2. These values are not derived from a specific set of requirements rather they are an estimate of what is required from the distributed aperture system to be an effective laser pointer system for some applications.

The characteristics of the light exiting the bundle are determined both by the parameters of the individual fibers and those of the fiber bundle. The properties of the fibers used in some embodiments are given in Table 3 and the wavelength transmission range is shown in .

To obtain a uniform or top hat profile in the far field requires beginning with a fiber that has a uniform intensity profile over the core and transforming that into an Airy pattern intensity distribution in the near field as illustrated in and . Propagation to the far field transforms the beam back into a uniform intensity profile.

To produce a uniform intensity distribution at the output of the fiber requires that the fiber core is large enough to support a large number of transverse modes. The number of modes that a cylindrical fiber can support is given by

If is large the problem follows geometrical theory of beam shaping. If is small then the problem is dominated by diffraction making it impossible to redistribute the laser power. shows the effect of increasing the parameter on the shape of the output intensity profile is normalized intensity and is normalized radius . It can be seen that with 32 the output beam intensity profile is essentially a flat top. This puts a lower limit on the fiber core diameter of D 85 microns. If D 100 m is chosen then the configuration parameter is V 18.8 and the number of modes the fiber can carry is M 178.

The next question is how the laser light may be injected in such a way that it occupies the modes. The most straightforward method is to simply couple the light into the fiber and let coupling between fiber modes transfer light from the initially occupied modes to all of the modes. Unfortunately this method requires long fibers 100 m and the absorption and scattering losses that would result from propagating over larger distances in the fiber cannot be tolerated.

Another method of filling the fiber modes is to degrade the beam parameter product of the laser light upon injecting it into the fiber such that it fills the fiber beam parameter product. The beam parameter product of a mid IR fiber with a 100 m core is 40 mm mrad. Optically pumped semiconductor lasers OPSLs typically have beam parameter products of about 25 mm by 10 mm mrad in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the emitting junction. Thus the beam parameter product must be degraded by about 1.6 times in one direction and by four times in the other. Focusing the laser to a spot size slightly smaller than the fiber core and using an appropriate binary phase plate see N. Davidson R. Ozeri and R. Baron Fabrication of binary phase surface relief optical elements by selective deposition of dielectric layers Rev. Sci. Instru. 70 2 pp. 1245 1247 1999 to expand the divergence on the beam such that it matches the fiber numerical aperture NA will degrade the beam parameter product. The phase plate reduces the spatial coherence of the laser light. For example in some embodiments 10 W laser would lead to a peak intensity of 

It is reasonable to wonder if speckle due to the interference between modes could result in a non uniform intensity distribution at the end of the fiber. If the bandwidth of the laser light satisfies the following relationship

To cover the field of regard of the missile warning sensor the fiber bundle must be composed of a 90 90 matrix of fibers since each fiber will have a 1 field of view and the sensor has a 90 field of regard. With 8 100 fibers that have 100 m cores the fiber bundle will have a cross section of 

The cladding thickness affects both the fiber bundle fill factor and the losses due to light leakage out of the fiber. If a fiber for long distance light transport were being designed the cladding thickness would be made at least 5 times greater than the longest wavelength the fiber would carry to limit losses. As the cladding thickness is decreased the rays striking the cladding at high angles of incidence will leak out through the cladding and be lost. Light in the higher order modes tends to propagate at higher angles so the higher modes will be the first to be lost. Fortunately many embodiments of the invention use fiber lengths less than five meters 5 m so light leakage losses should not be too high. Some embodiments select the cladding thickness of 10 m initially based primarily on the fill factor issue.

The various parameters of the fiber and bundle design have been analyzed in light of a baseline set of requirements and assigned reasonable values. With the values selected it appears that it will be possible to produce a flat top distribution in the far field cover the entire missile warning sensor field of regard meet efficiency goals and cover the field of regard while minimizing areas with low radiant intensity due to cladding and interstitial areas Table 4 summarizes the design parameters for the fiber bundle and describes the effects of scaling the parameter to guide future design tradeoffs.
