This application claims the benefit of provisional application Ser. No. 60 723 491 filed Oct. 3 2005 and provisional application Ser. No. 60 732 979 filed Nov. 2 2005 both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention relates to an intermediate of rosuvastatin having low levels of diastereomeric impurities and a process for the preparation thereof.

Rosuvastatin calcium monocalcium bis 7 4 4 fluorophenyl 6 isopropyl 2 N methyl N methylsulfonylaminopyrimidin 5 yl 3R 5S dihydroxy E 6 heptenoate is an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor developed by Shionogi for the once daily oral treatment of hyperlipidaemia Ann Rep Shionogi 1996 Direct communications Shionogi 8 Feb. 1999 25 Feb. 2000 . Rosuvastatin calcium is a superstatin which can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides more effectively than first generation drugs. Rosuvastatin calcium has the following chemical formula 

Rosuvastatin calcium is marketed under the name CRESTOR for treatment of a mammal such as a human. According to the maker of CRESTOR it is administered in a daily dose of from about 5 mg to about 40 mg. For patients requiring less aggressive LDL C reductions or who have pre disposing factors for myopathy a 5 mg dose is recommended while 10 mg dose is recommended for the average patient 20 mg dose for patients with marked hyper cholesterolemia and aggressive lipid targets 190 mg dL and the 40 mg dose for patients who have not been responsive to lower doses.

Rosuvastatin is an enantiomerically pure compound having two chiral centers at positions 3 and 5 of the molecule. Two of the four diastereoisomers of Rosuvastatin calcium are 3R 5R and 3R 5S derivatives. These diastereoisomers can be detected by reverse phase HPLC.

The synthetic process disclosed in US RE37 314E for rosuvastatin involves reduction of a keto ester of a rosuvastatin at carbon 5 to obtain a diol ester. This reduction at position 5 is a standard typical step in the synthesis of statins. This reduction step however can result in diastereoisomeric impurities.

WO 2005 040134 discloses a process that is reported to reduce the diastereoisomer content of rosuvastatin through lactonization or through conversion of amorphous rosuvastatin to crystalline rosuvastatin and subsequent conversion to the amorphous form.

There is a need in the art for preparation of diastereomerically pure rosuvastatin and its intermediates.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a rosuvastatin intermediate of the following structure 

In another embodiment the present invention provides a process for preparing a rosuvastatin intermediate diol ester having the structure

b adding to said combination a solution of a rosuvastatin keto ester in an organic solvent wherein the rosuvastatin keto ester has the following formula 

In another embodiment the present invention provides a process for isolating a diol ester of rosuvastatin having the following structure 

In another embodiment the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising rosuvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof prepared by converting C Crosuvastatin ester preferably t butyl ester having less than about 0.3 diastereomeric impurities as measured by area percentage HPLC to rosuvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and combining the rosuvastatin with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

In another embodiment the present invention provides use of C Crosuvastatin ester preferably t butyl ester having less than about 0.3 diastereomeric impurities as measured by HPLC in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition.

Diastereomeric impurities in a composition of rosuvastatin may decrease the biological activity of the composition and thus rosuvastatin having low levels of diastereomeric impurities is desirable for formulating pharmaceutical compositions of rosuvastatin. The invention provides a process of preparing rosuvastatin having low levels of diastereomeric impurities through the reduction of an intermediate C Cester of rosuvastatin such as t butyl rosuvastatin ester TBRE with 9 methoxy 9 bora bicyclo 3.3.1 nonane MeO 9 BBN .

Reduction of a keto ester of rosuvastatin with MeO 9 BBN provides a diol ester of rosuvastatin having high diastereomeric purity. The diastereomeric purity of the diol ester can be further increased by crystallizing the diol ester from an organic solvent. The diastereomerically pure diol ester then can be used to prepare rosuvastatin and salts thereof also having low levels of diastereomeric impurities.

As used herein the term normal addition generally refers to adding a reducing agent to a mixture of an ester to be reduced see e.g. US RE37 314E .

As used herein the term reverse addition generally refers to adding a compound that is to be reduced i.e. a keto ester of rosuvastatin to a mixture of a reducing agent see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 189 164 .

As used herein the term diastereomeric impurity refers to the total amount of any diastereomer of rosuvastatin or its intermediates other than the preferred 3R 5S diastereomer and in particular refers to the 3R 5R diastereoisomer of rosuvastatin or its intermediates.

Glidants can be added to improve the flowability of a non compacted solid composition and to improve the accuracy of dosing. Excipients that may function as glidants include colloidal silicon dioxide magnesium trisilicate powdered cellulose starch talc and tribasic calcium phosphate.

When a dosage form such as a tablet is made by the compaction of a powdered composition the composition is subjected to pressure from a punch and dye. Some excipients and active ingredients have a tendency to adhere to the surfaces of the punch and dye which can cause the product to have pitting and other surface irregularities. A lubricant can be added to the composition to reduce adhesion and ease the release of the product from the dye. Lubricants include magnesium stearate calcium stearate glyceryl monostearate glyceryl palmitostearate hydrogenated castor oil hydrogenated vegetable oil mineral oil polyethylene glycol sodium benzoate sodium lauryl sulfate sodium stearyl fumarate stearic acid talc and zinc stearate.

Selection of excipients and the amounts used may be readily determined by the formulation scientist based upon experience and consideration of standard procedures and reference works in the field.

The solid compositions of the invention include powders granulates aggregates and compacted compositions. The dosages include dosages suitable for oral buccal rectal parenteral including subcutaneous intramuscular and intravenous inhalant and ophthalmic administration. Although the most suitable administration in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated the most preferred route of the invention is oral.

The active ingredient and excipients may be formulated into compositions and dosage forms according to methods known in the art.

A composition for tableting or capsule filling may be prepared by wet granulation. In wet granulation some or all of the active ingredients and excipients in powder form are blended and then further mixed in the presence of a liquid typically water that causes the powders to clump into granules. The granulate is screened and or milled dried and then screened and or milled to the desired particle size. The granulate may then be tableted or other excipients may be added prior to tableting such as a glidant and or a lubricant.

A tableting composition may be prepared conventionally by dry blending. For example the blended composition of the actives and excipients may be compacted into a slug or a sheet and then comminuted into compacted granules. The compacted granules may subsequently be compressed into a tablet.

As an alternative to dry granulation a blended composition may be compressed directly into a compacted dosage form using direct compression techniques. Direct compression produces a more uniform tablet without granules. Excipients that are particularly well suited for direct compression tableting include microcrystalline cellulose spray dried lactose dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and colloidal silica. The proper use of these and other excipients in direct compression tableting is known to those in the art with experience and skill in particular formulation challenges of direct compression tableting.

A capsule filling of the invention may comprise any of the aforementioned blends and granulates that were described with reference to tableting however they are not subjected to a final tableting step.

A preferred dosage is from about 5 mg to about 80 mg per day more preferably about 5 mg to about 40 mg per day with 5 mg 10 mg 20 mg 40 mg and 80 mg tablets once a day being a preferred method of administration. These tablets may have the following inactive ingredients microcrystalline cellulose NF lactose monohydrate NF tribasic calcium phosphate NF crospovidone NF magnesium stearate NF hypromellose NF triacetin NF and titanium dioxide USP.
