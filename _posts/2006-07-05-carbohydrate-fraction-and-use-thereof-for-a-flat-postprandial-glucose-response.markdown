The invention relates to a carbohydrate fraction that gives a sustained and lower glucose release after consumption.

Glucose is an important source of energy to the cells in the human body and abundantly present in food ingredients. After consumption of starch or other dietetic available sources of glucose and their subsequent digestion glucose is released in the gastrointestinal tract where it is rapidly and effectively absorbed from the intestinal lumen. This will usually increase glucose concentrations in blood. The change in glucose after consumption of a food is called the postprandial glucose response PPGR which can be measured as the area under the curve AUC which plots the plasma glucose concentration with time. The human body strives to maintain homeostasis of glucose levels in tissue and blood with time in order to allow proper functioning of all cells. One important instrument to achieve glucose homeostasis is the release of insulin by the pancreas when the concentration of specific food components like glucose starts to increase. Under normal circumstances this will increase glucose transport into the cell and the formation of glycogen using glucose and trigger other metabolic changes therewith rapidly causing the blood glucose levels to decrease to normal levels.

A person that does not react properly on released insulin is said to be insulin resistant. Large groups of persons suffer from insulin resistance like many obese persons persons suffering from the so called metabolic syndrome or syndrome X diabetics and many patients in hospitals or nursing homes who developed a temporarily or longer lasting insulin resistance as a cause of their disease. Part of the diabetics also experience an insufficient capacity to increase insulin concentrations in blood after consumption of food called post prandially . Persons that suffer from insulin resistance demonstrate abnormal high postprandial glucose response even after consumption of moderate amounts of food ingredients that comprise glucose. When high postprandial glucose concentrations occur relatively frequently and over longer periods of time they can cause several severe health problems. Known secondary side effects as can be found in diabetics are problems in the cardiovascular system such as hypertension atherosclerosis bad blood supply to peripheral tissues stroke heart attacks etc. as well as problems in the kidney in particular an abnormal glomerular filtration rate and a wide range of neuropathies and retinopathies like cataract. It was also found that mortality of severe disease in hospital patients is associated with the severity of insulin resistance.

The decrease of postprandial glucose response PPGR has been the subject of numerous research efforts. Many types of carbohydrates have been proposed to induce a low PPGR. Also inclusion of dietetic fibre in a nutritional product has been proposed for this purpose for example viscous fibres like gums or pectin. The disadvantage of using such fibres is the increase in viscosity when used in liquid products in amounts that are effective. According to the European FLAIR Concerted Action on Resistant Starch EURESTA resistant starch is defined as the sum of starch and products of starch hydrolysis not absorbed in the small intestine of healthy individuals .

Commercially available ingredients that can be used as a source of resistant starch are mainly considered to be a source of fibre so being non digestible thereby neglecting the value of the remaining digestible part of the ingredient as a principle source of digestible carbohydrates. It is generally avoided to include fibres in Western nutritional food products in amounts larger than 20 40 grams per daily dose as they are believed to cause gastrointestinal discomfort in these doses like bloating flatulence and loss of appetite. Patients in hospitals or nursing homes may also develop constipation or a high faecal mass when too high amounts or the wrong type of fibres are consumed especially in combination with drinking too little. In liquid enteral nutrition for the latter group of patients typically about 1 g fibres is included in a nutritional product per 20 g digestible carbohydrates.

Englyst H. N. et al. 46 Suppl. 2 S33 S50 1992 classify resistant starch RS into three categories for reasons of different digestion resistance Type 1 RS are starches which are physically inaccessible to the digestive enzymes type 2 RS are starches that exist as granules and can comprise predominantly amylose and type 3 RS are retrograded starches. Cross linked and or chemically modified starches are sometimes considered to be type 4 RS but their non food grade status makes them at present undesirable for commercial application in the food industry.

Each of these ingredients can be manufactured differently and their behaviour in vivo depends on the way the ingredient was processed prior to consumption. Typically manufacturers of resistant starch ingredients develop an ingredient having a RS level that is as high as possible and this amount must be constant and independent of the way of processing of the ingredient when it is included in new food products.

It is known that the digestibility of native starch can change during food processing especially when heat is applied to the food carbohydrates. Heat treatment plays an important role in manufacturing of clinical liquid formulae in order to kill micro organisms or spores thereof and thereby make the formulae safe for consumption by persons that suffer from disease or health disorders or persons who are immune compromised and or to prevent spoilage of the formulae during shelf life. A heat treatment may have different effects on the starch properties as does moisture content pressure pH ionic strength during processing and in the nutritional product. Annison G. and Topping D. L. 1994 14 297 320 show a significant increase of the viscosity of a starch containing nutrition when subjected to a specific heat treatment and even gelatinization may occur which is undesirable in liquid clinical nutritional products that are intended to be used for tube or sip feeding. In addition the starches may crystallize and precipitate in production lines or in the product therewith causing problems with homogeneity and blockage of tubing lines. Starch crystals may cause a sandy feeling in the mouth when consumed.

In the art little attention is paid to the fraction of resistant starch ingredients that is actually available in vivo to man. Most commercially available RS ingredients are to a varying degree partially digestible within 20 minutes after consumption. The remainder is undigested by the enzymes that are released within the human gastrointestinal tract and used as fermentable substrate by colonic micro organisms. Therefore such resistant starch ingredients do not behave as sustained release carbohydrates.

For example EP A 1.088.832 discloses a granular starch that is prepared by selected heat moisture treatment and which heat treated starch is made resistant for more than 80 preferably has a molecular weight of 5 20 kDa degree of polymerization DP of 30 123 and a low amylopectin content. The material is appreciated as source of dietary fibre. Food products are described which comprise more than 20 wt of total dietary fibre. EP A 0846704 describes a retrograded starch having more than 55 resistant starch with more than 50 of linear chains of glucans having a DP between 10 35 and a DSC melting peak temperature below 115 C. It is suitable for use as a prebiotic component in particular as a butyrate producing fibre.

A starch having sustained digestion properties is taught in US 2003 0219520. The enzymatically debranched starch comprises at least 90 linear glucans preferably a highly crystalline amylose having 6 65 anhydro glucose units linked by 1 4 D glucoside bonds and a DE 6.0. No change in the material properties is observed during typical food processing conditions when included in an amount of 1 50 wt in a wide range of food products. Upon consumption between 22 and 50 wt is digested in the first twenty minutes and 48 74 wt is digested within two hours after start of the test. Table 2 demonstrates the digestibility profile after a specific heat treatment at high or low moisture results about 31 40 is digested during the first 20 minutes and 65 70 during the first 120 minutes after start of their test. The document is silent about the behaviour of the ingredient when it is subjected to heating at higher temperatures and in particular ultra high heat treatments as can be beneficially used during manufacture of enteral clinical nutrition. It is also silent about the effect of heating in a matrix that comprises proteins and or lipids and or other carbohydrate fractions. These components are known to be able to interact with amylose crystallization and therewith digestibility.

It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a nutritional product that is heat treated and safe with regard to the presence of micro organisms spores and other potentially harmful components that is attractive to the consumer from an organoleptic point of view especially in terms of mouth feel of the product when it is stored for prolonged times and that is extremely effective in providing rapidly glucose to the consumer and maintaining a clinically significant supply of glucose during a prolonged time without resulting in undesirably high concentrations of glucose in the blood even in persons that have become insulin resistant.

It is a further object of the invention to provide such products to persons that suffer from insulin resistance in order to prevent development of disorders which result from prolonged and frequent high levels of glucose in blood such as those diseases that result from advanced glycation products AGE neuropathies retina problems and kidney problems.

It is now found that the combination of specific types of slowly digestible starches and one or more of the monosaccharides galactose mannose and ribose is suitable for providing glucose to the human body in a slow released and sustained way wherein the monosaccharides contribute to the glucose availability through metabolic conversion. Not only does this combination have a positive effect on the glycemic and insulinemic response GI or the total area under the PPGR curve but it also establishes a substantially flat PPGR over longer times. A desirable PPGR is found to be one that shows a rapid but limited initial increase of the concentration of glucose in blood after administration in order to give a quick improvement of energy status and prevent too low levels of glucose for proper functioning and then stabilizes for longer times. This is particularly important for persons suffering from hypoglycemic levels which are defined to be fasting glucose levels below 3.0 mM. The slowly digestible starch provides sustained glucose release between 20 minutes and two hours after consumption whereas the abovementioned non glucose monosaccharides function as an insulin releasing agent to stimulate the uptake of the blood glucose and moreover to decrease the amount of metabolic stress the liver experiences. The prolonged increase of plasma glucose levels is especially important for persons that cannot eat at regular intervals and for example as night time formula for infants.

It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a nutritional composition that is safe for consumption by those persons that may benefit from consuming a rapidly available and sustained release glucose source and that comprises fats proteins and digestible carbohydrates and wherein the digestible carbohydrate fraction comprises galactose mannose and or ribose a sustained release glucose source and a rapidly available glucose source.

Particularly the invention relates to a heat treated nutritional composition comprising lipids proteins and carbohydrates wherein the carbohydrate fraction comprises a one or more monosaccharides selected from galactose ribose and mannose b carbohydrates capable of providing b1 sustained release glucose and optionally b2 rapidly available glucose c optionally fructose d optionally glucose containing disaccharides other than maltose and sucrose and e optionally sugar polyols wherein the heat treated nutritional composition comprises 5 30 wt of group a and wherein group b provides 30 65 wt sustained release glucose and 15 40 wt rapidly available glucose based on the dry weight of the sum of groups a e in the heat treated nutritional composition. The product may be a dry product or preferably a non viscous liquid product.

The invention further relates to a heat treated nutritional composition comprising lipids proteins and carbohydrates wherein the carbohydrate fraction comprises a one or more monosaccharides selected from galactose ribose and mannose b carbohydrates capable of providing b1 sustained release glucose and b2 rapidly available glucose c optionally fructose d glucose containing disaccharides other than maltose and sucrose and e optionally sugar polyols wherein the heat treated nutritional composition comprises 5 30 wt of group a and 5 30 wt of group d and wherein group b provides 5 40 wt b2 rapidly available glucose based on the dry weight of the sum of groups a e in the heat treated nutritional composition.

The invention also pertains to the use of such heat treated nutritional compositions for controlling glucose levels in blood and or tissue in a mammal in need thereof in particular for the prevention and or treatment of diabetics insulin resistance obesity and controlling postprandial glucose response.

In particular the digestible carbohydrate fraction provides 5 65 wt of b1 glucose within 20 120 minutes after start of the digestion process as measured by the method described by Englyst et al 1999 69 448 454. The amount of sustained release glucose source in the product is therefore the weight amount of glucose that becomes available between 20 and 120 minutes in this test. Typically the last precursor for glucose production in the Englyst test is either maltose or sucrose. Obviously glucose supplied by metabolic conversion by the human body via galactose mannose or ribose does not contribute to the availability of glucose according to the Englyst method which stimulates digestion in the GI tract. Gluco oligosaccharides which do not produce glucose according to the Englyst test whether within 20 minute or longer but which are hydrolysed in a rat intestinal hydrolysis test see Mishima et al. 2005 53 7257 7261 are considered to be sustained release glucose sources.

In addition to those digestible carbohydrates according to the Englyst method group b also comprises oligosaccharides having a chain length of 3 to 20 anhydromonose units at least half of which are connected to each other via no n 1 4 bonds e.g. by 1 1 1 3 1 5 and 1 6 bonds. Though these oligosaccharides release glucose in a sustained way in test systems which mimic intestinal digestion system in mammals e.g. by using a mixture of intestinal enzymes which include brush border enzymes the oligosaccharides will typically not produce a raise in plasma glucose levels after consumption thereof in amounts up to 25 grams bolus for an adult human being. Examples of such oligosaccharides are isomalto oligosaccharides and other gluco oligosaccharides obtained by transglucosylation of maltose maltodextrins or other substrates as described in WO04 081022 EP A 1229803 and WO 05 089483. Certain oligosaccharides are also referred to as resistant maltodextrins the digestible part thereof is also covered by the sustained release glucose sources of the invention

The terms rapidly digestible starch RDS slowly digestible starch SDS and non digestible starch NDS are obtained from the classification taught by Englyst H. N. et al. 1992 46 S33 S50. The classification method involves incubation with pancreatic amylase and amyloglucosidase at 37 C. RDS is the starch hydrolysed during the first 20 minutes and SDS is the starch hydrolysed in the following 100 minutes i.e. between 20 120 minutes after the start of incubation. NDS is that fraction of the starch which escapes digestion during the first 120 minutes after start of the digestion test NDS coinciding with the RS part of a resistant starch ingredient throughout the application. The contents of the relevant pages S35 S38 and S39 describing the classification method are hereby incorporated by reference. The total amount of starch TS including resistant starch is determined according to the method as provided by McCleary 85 1103 1111.

The term rapidly available glucose thus refers to the glucose that is available within 20 minutes according to the Englyst method comprising both readily available glucose and glucose that only becomes available after digestion but within 20 minutes such as glucose obtained from RDS. The amounts of rapidly available glucose and sustained release glucose are calculated as the weight amount of available glucose provided by the source relative to the weight of the digestible carbohydrate fraction. The total available glucose includes glucose released from the oligosaccharides having a chain length of 3 to 20 anhydromonose units at least half of which are connected to each other via non 1 4 bonds.

The digestible carbohydrate fraction comprises all carbohydrates that provide glucose according to the Englyst method thus also including e.g. the glucose part of sucrose and free glucose that is available without digestion but also monosaccharides other than glucose that do not contribute according to the Englyst method but which can be taken up by the body metabolically especially galactose ribose mannose fructose including the fructose part of sucrose and also glucose containing disaccharides other than maltose and sucrose as well as sugar alcohols even if they are only partly or slowly digestible. The digestible carbohydrate part can include maltodextrins glucose syrups. Thus where digestible carbohydrate fraction is mentioned it is meant the combination of monosaccharides selected from galactose ribose and mannose carbohydrates capable of providing sustained release glucose and rapidly available glucose according to the Englyst method fructose glucose containing disaccharides other than maltose and sucrose and sugar polyols and also the aforementioned oligosaccharides having a chain length of 3 to 20 anhydromonose units and non 1 4 bonds.

Thus for the purpose of the invention carbohydrates capable of providing sustained release glucose include starch type carbohydrates producing glucose within 20 and 120 minutes according to the Englyst test see above as well as glucose containing oligosaccharides typically non 1 4 linked and excluding maltose and sucrose producing glucose in the rat intestinal hydrolysis test of Mishima see above .

Throughout the application the dry weight is determined as the constant value obtained upon drying with air at 100 C. at atmospheric pressure.

In the literature another distinction between digestible and non digestible carbohydrates can be made on the basis of the method of Lee et al as published in 75 395 416 1992. According to their definition the non digestible carbohydrates comprise resistant starch and optionally non viscous fibres like sufficiently far hydrolysed gums Arabic guar gellan hydrolysed pectin hydrolysed tamarind or konjac small glucans. If insulin hydrolysed forms thereof and or polyfructoses are present the method of Prosky 82 223 226 1999 is applied and added to the numbers obtained from Lee.

40 100 preferably 60 90 more preferably at least 75 of the sustained release glucose is provided by a resistant starch ingredient i.e. a starch containing NDS and SDS.

The resistant starch ingredient comprises amylose which are linear 1 4 glucose polysaccharides having at least 20 units linear oligosaccharides and optionally amylopectin branched polysaccharides . If present the amount of amylopectin should be 0 10 preferably 0 2 and more preferably 0 0.5 wt of the digestible carbohydrates. The amount of amylopectin can be measured according to Yun et al 42 302 305 1990 after defatting of the sample according to Morrison et al 9 20 1983. The resistant starch ingredient comprises 42 70 wt and most preferably 45 60 wt amylose the remainder having less than 20 units.

The resistant starch ingredient comprises predominantly linear glucose polymers having a length of 10 2000 anhydro glucose units. About 35 70 and preferably 40 60 of the number of molecules have a degree of polymerization between 10 and 35. The remainder of the molecules contribute heavily to the mass of the material. Preferably between 40 and 60 of the mass of the ingredient has a degree of polymerization over 200 anhydro glucose moieties.

After heat treatment the resistant starch ingredient comprises 5 80 preferably 5 60 preferably 8 60 more preferably 8 55 most preferably 10 55 NDS. It comprises 5 55 preferably 10 55 more preferably 10 50 more preferably 12 50 most preferably 12 40 SDS and 10 70 more preferably 15 60 and most preferably 20 50 is RDS the total of NDS SDS and RDS being 100 . The resistant starch ingredient therefore contributes to the rapidly available glucose slowly available glucose and indigestible carbohydrate fraction in the composition according the invention.

The total amount of rapidly available glucose sources in the nutritional composition is 5 40 wt more preferably 10 35 wt most preferably at least 20 wt and the sustained release glucose sources are present in an amount of 5 65 wt more preferably 10 60 wt most preferably 15 55 wt of the digestible carbohydrate fraction. Alternatively the total amount of rapidly available glucose sources in the nutritional composition is 15 40 wt more preferably 20 35 wt and the sustained release glucose sources are present in an amount of 30 65 wt more preferably 35 60 wt most preferably 40 55 wt of the digestible carbohydrate fraction. The weight of these glucose sources are only taken into account for the parts that provide the rapidly available and sustained release glucose.

In the final product the amylose molecules may form crystals. If these are formed the average particle size of the amylose crystals should preferably be less than 60 more preferably less than 40 and most preferably 5 20 micrometer. The amount of particles that has a particle size above 20 micron must be less than 50 preferably less than 10 more preferably less than 5 . Such processing conditions are applied and those ingredients selected to ensure that during shelf life particle size of amylose crystals will not change outside the range as indicated.

The degree of polymerization DP of a molecule is determined by dividing its molecular weight by the molecular weight of 162 g mol of the anhydro glucose unit. The digestible carbohydrate fraction of the invention preferably comprises a large fraction of sustained release glucose source. This source is preferably a starch and more preferably a resistant starch ingredient i.e. starch having sustainedly digestible starch and only partial resistant starch properties. Such resistant starch ingredient is preferably present in an amount of 30 65 more preferably 35 60 most preferably 40 50 wt of the digestible carbohydrate fraction based on its contribution to the total amount of rapid and sustained release glucose.

The amount of resistant starch ingredient in the final liquid nutritional composition should be 0.5 10 preferably 0.8 8 more preferably 0.9 6 and most preferably 1 5 w v . This concentration is important to cause that the inclusion of the resistant starch ingredient in a liquid sterilized product results in the sustained release properties according to the invention.

The digestible carbohydrate fraction comprises galactose mannose and or ribose preferably galactose and or ribose most preferably at least galactose. After absorption it can be slowly converted predominantly by liver transferases to glucose. The total amount of the monosaccharides galactose ribose and mannose in the carbohydrate fraction must be 5 30 preferably 10 25 wt more preferably 15 22 wt of the dry weight of the digestible carbohydrate fraction. In the context of the invention galactose and ribose also involve oxidized equivalents hereof commonly referred to as aldaric acids such as ribonic acid ribaric acid arabinaric acid. Equivalent dosages of alternative components can be calculated by using the same molar amount and correcting for the molecular weight of the alternative component.

The digestible carbohydrate fraction may comprise fructose as another monosaccharide different from glucose but only in an amount below 10 wt of the digestible carbohydrate fraction preferably 1 10 wt more preferably less than 6 wt and most preferably less than 4 wt in order to decrease the amount of metabolic stress which the liver must experience and to decrease the degree of Maillardation of the product. The contribution of fructose to the availability of glucose according to the Englyst method is zero. The amount of fructose includes the amount of fructose present in sucrose.

0 60 preferably 10 55 more preferably 20 50 most preferably 25 50 of the rapidly available glucose is provided by a rapidly available glucose source other than the RDS fraction of the RS ingredient.

The digestible carbohydrate fraction can comprise glucose polymers other than the resistant starch ingredient and which glucose polymers do not exhibit a SDS part. These non SDS containing glucose polymers are defined to be those poly and oligosaccharides having glucose as main constituent e.g. more than 90 wt preferably more than 99 wt consist of glucose moieties. They preferably contain less than 10 wt RS. Typically these oligo and polysaccharides have a MW of maximally 1 000 000 and preferably below 3200 and can be obtained by isolation and hydrolysis from plant material like starches from corn potato cereals or tapioca. Many types of maltodextrins are suitable as well as glucose syrups and free glucose and other sources well known in the art of manufacturing enteral clinical nutrition and infant formulae. Maltodextrins having a dextrose equivalent value of 1 47 and preferably 2 40 more preferably 6 39 are preferred ingredients to provide rapid availability of glucose. Optionally the weight ratio of non SDS containing glucose polymer to the sum of the non glucose monosaccharides galactose mannose and ribose is 0.3 4 preferably 0.7 3 and more preferably 1.0 2.5.

The digestible carbohydrate fraction may also comprise free glucose. It has been found that the amount of free glucose and the amount of glucose syrup and glucose polymers including the RDS part of the resistant starch ingredient exclusively contribute to the amount of rapidly available glucose.

It is preferred that the amount of rapidly available glucose is 1.25 10 more preferably 1.5 8 times the weight amount of free galactose when galactose is included in the formula. When free ribose is included the weight amount of rapidly available glucose in particular of free glucose is 0.8 10 and preferably 1 8 times as high as the amount of free ribose. When free fructose is included the ratio of the weight of rapidly available glucose to that of fructose should be in the range 1 0 0.12.

The digestible carbohydrate fraction may comprise 5 30 wt preferably 5 20 wt. more preferably 10 20 wt. most preferably 10 15 wt. of a glucose containing disaccharide other than maltose and sucrose preferably a disaccharide selected from the group of lactose palatinose trehalose leucrose and isomaltose preferably lactose palatinose and trehalose. It is preferred that the digestible carbohydrate fraction comprises a mixture of at least two of these disaccharides and more preferably a mixture of lactose and palatinose except for persons who are extreme lactose intolerant. Maltose and sucrose are excluded from this group of glucose containing disaccharides as they already contribute to the availability in the Englyst method for their glucose part. However the contribution of the glucose containing disaccharides other than maltose and sucrose to the availability of glucose in the Englyst method is zero. Breakdown of palatinose for instance only takes place in the intestines involving the use of isomaltase. The aforementioned amounts of galactose and fructose according to the invention do not comprise the galactose part of lactose and the fructose part of sucrose and palatinose when used.

Also sugar polyols or sugar alcohols like isomalt 6 O D glucopyranosyl D sorbitol or mannitol xylitol and or sorbitol may beneficially be incorporated in the composition of the invention. When included the amount will typically be in the range of 2 14 preferably 4 10 wt of the digestible carbohydrate fraction.

It is preferred that the sum of b1 carbohydrates capable of providing sustained release glucose d glucose containing disaccharides other than maltose and sucrose and if present e sugar polyols is 35 65 wt of the nutritional composition.

The composition preferably comprises the digestible carbohydrate fraction of the invention in an amount of 60 200 preferably 80 160 more preferably 10 140 g l.

Where it is mentioned that the nutritional composition is heat treated it is meant that at least a liquid premix of the starch fraction is heat treated which subsequently can be mixed with the other components of the nutritional composition. However the heat treatment can also be applied to the complete composition in liquid form or to the carbohydrate fraction. In normal practices it appears possible to heat all components of the formula simultaneously and thus not only reducing the amount of micro organisms to a sufficient degree but also to treat the starch in a proper way to increase the amount of slowly digestible glucose moieties. In those cases where free amino acids or heat sensitive components like growth factors immunoglobulins reducing sugars reactive ingredients or vitamins are present the various fractions of the composition can be heat treated differently.

A heat treatment makes it possible to prepare a liquid nutritional composition with low viscosity that can be applied for tube feeding as well as sip feeding and wherein the starches are freely dispersible resulting in favourable organoleptic properties.

Suitable heat treatment procedures include separate heating of fractions of the product in liquid form and aseptic blending of the appropriate amounts of each fraction especially the protein and digestible carbohydrate fractions the latter preferably combined with part of the lipid blend in particular 1 30 preferably 2 10 wt of the lipid blend to be included in the product and optionally a vitamin fraction. Conventional heating practices can be applied preferably a high moist sterilization treatment. Suitable heat treatment procedures also include simultaneous heating of the complete product in case specific heat treatment practices are applied and protein sources are applied that comprise low amounts of sensitive lysine. Such specific heating practices include procedures that apply shorter heating times but still produce sterile products like ultra high temperature treatment procedures like UHT that have been described as such in the art. Such products appear to provide sterile products that have experienced less Maillardation during processing.

Heat treatment procedures preferably involve heating of the composition for 0.1 seconds 6 minutes at a temperature at 100 180 C. They typically comprise one sterilization step and optionally one or more pasteurization or homogenization steps. More preferably the heat treatment step includes heating at a temperature of 105 160 C. even more preferably 115 150 C. and in particular higher than 122 C. Although the preferred heat treatment time is between 0.1 seconds 6 minutes the actual time is dependent on the heat treatment temperature. Typically the product will be heated for 2 6 preferably 3 5.5 minutes at 121 C. 12 36 seconds at 131 C. 1 4 seconds at 141 C. and 0.1 0.4 seconds at 151 C. Conditions at other temperatures can be interpolated and extrapolated from these numbers. The maximum amount of heating is not only determined by the amount of change in properties of the resistant starch but also to the degree of Maillardation that may occur and the decomposition of heat sensitive products.

With standard knowledge regarding the amount of heating that is desired to kill micro organisms to a sufficient degree a decimal reduction of the total number of micro organisms by at least a factor 3 preferably more than a factor 4 can be achieved. The success rate is dependent on the combination of temperature heating time degree of moisture pressure and the presence of additional stressors like radiation or vibration which are known to the person skilled in the art.

The heat treated carbohydrate fraction and or the heat treated nutritional composition may be in the form of a free flowing powder or a concentrate comprising less than 5 wt preferably less than 1 wt of water based on the total weight. This can for instance be achieved by conventional spray drying after heat treatment.

In a preferred embodiment the nutritional composition is in the form of a liquid suitable for tube or sip feeding. It has an osmolality of preferably 300 700 more preferably 330 600 most preferably 340 500 mOsm l.

Preferably the nutritional composition further comprises 10 30 wt based on the total dry weight of the carbohydrate fraction of groups a e in the nutritional composition of nutritional fibres. Such a carbohydrate fibre mixture preferably contains f 40 55 wt of non digestible oligosaccharides having a DP from 3 to 20 g 40 55 wt of non digestible non soluble polysaccharides and h 0 20 wt of non digestible soluble polysaccharides the sum of f g and h being 100 wt .

In a preferred embodiment the fibre mixture contains 42 50 wt of non digestible oligosaccharides in group f 42 50 wt of non digestible non soluble polysaccharides in group g and 1 12 wt of non digestible soluble polysaccharides in group h .

The polysaccharides of group g preferably comprise 30 50 wt. based on the total fibre mixture of resistant starch i.e. the fraction of starch that remains undigested during the first 120 minutes of the Englyst test.

The non digestible oligosaccharides of group f preferably comprise 10 50 wt. based on the total fibre mixture of galacto oligosaccharides especially galacto oligosaccharides.

It is advantageous to include non starch non viscous fibres in the product. Viscous fibres optionally in combination with other food components are known to influence gastric emptying rates and the rate of digestion of foods in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition such fraction may provide a substrate for a healthy microbial flora in the gastrointestinal tract and improve immune function in the target groups contemplated. It is now found that the fibres that preferably are included in the product according the invention should not behave as viscous fibres both not in the product and neither in the gastrointestinal tract. The fibres of the invention are selected in such a way and included in such concentrations that they demonstrate a low viscosity in a nutritional composition. These fibres appear to demonstrate a low viscosity also under in vivo conditions. Fibres that can be used in the invention are trans galacto oligosaccharides GOS and extensively hydrolysed gums hydrolysed mannans hydrolysed arabans hydrolysed xylans hydrolysed beta glucans hydrolysed fructans fructose oligosaccharides FOS insulin and or oligofructoses.

The total amount of non starch and starch fibres including the NDS fraction of the resistant starch ingredient can be in the range of 2 30 preferably 3 18 more preferably 4 14 and most preferably 5 12 g l. The viscosity of the product is low in order to provide acceptable flowing characteristics for sip drinking and for tube feeding.

Other organoleptic properties like taste and smell can be influenced by applying methods known in the art using odorants and taste modifiers as required. Consistency and mouth feel depend on particle size of the ingredients and degree of homogenizing. Apart from the particle size for the sustained glucose source as discussed above also the other ingredients should not comprise large particles. In particular the minerals should not sediment. In order to achieve this only soluble forms of divalent ions like calcium zinc and magnesium were used during manufacture. Such forms are known in the art and include complexes and compounds with organic counter ions. The amount of calcium and phosphorous are also selected to be within the range of 10 70 preferably 20 60 mg 100 ml. The ratio of calcium to phosphorous is in the range 0.8 2 preferably 1.1 1.9 more preferably 1.3 1.8.

The compositions of the invention further comprise a fat or lipid fraction. Such a lipid fraction comprises oleic acid and essential fatty acids like linoleic acid and linolenic acid but could also comprise conjugated linolenic acids and omega 3 long chain fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.

Lipids are contemplated to include triglycerides or triacylglycerides di glycerides or diacylglycerides monoglycerides or monoacylglycerides phospholipids lysophospholipids sphingolipids and ceramides Other components that are soluble in petroleum ether or hexane like cholesterol and other sterols are not included in calculations about the lipid fraction.

Moreover the product can comprise micro ingredients like vitamins trace elements and minerals that are known in the art and carnitine equivalents inositol taurine and other food constituents such as flavours colorants or manufacturing aids.

The carbohydrate fraction and nutritional composition according to the invention are useful in maintaining a low and prolonged glucose response in blood and tissue after consumption and especially useful in cases of diabetics and or insulin resistance. People that suffer from or are extremely susceptible to insulin resistance are e.g. severely or critically ill patients in particular palliative patients like those that suffer from severe cancer or HIV infection. Other groups of patients suffering from difficulties to control their PPGR comprise those persons that were subjected to major surgery or exposed to other traumata malnourished persons in particular those suffering from protein energy malnutrition persons that suffer from obesity the Metabolic Syndrome Syndrome X hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia dyslipidemia hypertriglyceridemia and dysfibrinolysis but also large parts of the group of the elderly in Western societies. In addition the product can be useful for persons that have an increased risk in terms of a hereditary history of developing insulin resistance obesity or diabetics like many Hindustan persons and several Caucasian families for persons that plan irregular feeding pattern like sportsmen during an enduring exercise or persons that desire to maintain attention for longer periods of time like students during studying or examines or during meetings.

It is thus an object of the invention to use the nutritional compositions according to the invention for the prevention and or treatment of diabetics insulin resistance obesity controlling postprandial glucose response metabolic syndrome syndrome X hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia dyslipidemia hypertriglyceridemia dysfibrinolysis and or disorders associated with major surgery or trauma in a mammal by maintaining a substantially stable glucose level or PPGR in the mammal s blood for a period starting after 20 minutes to 4 hours after administration. It is even more preferred to maintain the glucose concentration stable until 3 hours more preferably until 2 hours after administration.

With substantially stable glucose level or PPGR it is understood that the glucose level in blood does not vary more than about 1.6 mM and preferably less than 1.3 more preferably less than 1.0 mM per 20 minutes during the above mentioned period after consumption.

In case of diabetics the glucose blood levels are typically maintained between 4 mM and 15 mM. However in the case of severe diabetics peak postprandial glucose concentrations above 15 mM can still be observed. Under these circumstances the nutritional composition comprising the carbohydrate fraction of the invention should be consumed in more than one eating session and or in combination with administration of an appropriate amount of insulin prior to consumption of the food product. In case of non diabetics it is possible to control the glucose blood level even below 11 mM.

Preferably the glucose levels in plasma can be controlled between 5 and 8 mM in the abovementioned period without the necessity to consume large amounts of fibre with it as this may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and without replacing glucose sources by other carbohydrates which demand an unrealistic high metabolic capacity in the person or by high amounts of lipids which may disturb physiologically acceptable blood lipid or cholesterol profiles.

Moreover the product is effective in decreasing the risk for obtaining and decreasing the aggravation of several diseases which are associated with frequently elevated blood glucose levels which include retinopathies kidney diseases and neuropathies. Also diseases associated with the occurrence of advanced glycation products AGE can be prevented. Effectivity of the product can be determined by measuring the levels of glycated haemoglobin molecules Hb1Ac in blood.

Healthy male Wistar rats n 9 weighing 225 250 g at arrival were kept in a temperature and light controlled room dark period 16 00 h 4 00 h with ad libitum access to food Teklad standard lab chow and tap water unless otherwise stated. Under isoflurane anaesthesia the rats received a permanent intragastric canula in order to allow frequent and stress free intragastric administration of compounds and a permanent canula in the right atrium in order to allow frequent and stress free blood sampling. On the day of the experiment food was removed at 8 30 h. At 13 30 h the rats received a bolus of 2.0 g carbohydrate kg dissolved in water.

Administered volumes approximately 6 ml were corrected for the body weight of each individual rat and the carbohydrates were corrected for digestibility. At 10 minutes before and 5 10 15 20 30 45 and 75 minutes after administration of the bolus blood samples were taken and collected in ice chilled heparinised tubes. In each rat 4 different randomly assigned or carbohydrate sources were tested. At least one week of recovery was allowed between 2 subsequent experiments.

The figures demonstrate that the PPGR after consumption of the resistant starch ingredient according the invention RSI 1 having RDS 40 SDS 35 NDS 25 according to the Englyst method is much better than after consumption of conventionally used maltodextrins both in terms of quick availability of glucose as in a sustained provision of glucose moieties e.g. 45 minutes after consumption of the carbohydrate mix. This PPGR is further improved after blending the ingredient with the other digestible carbohydrate components. Also insulin release was improved.

The glucose release pattern of potato starch and heat treated resistant starch ingredient were tested by applying the method as described by Englyst 1999 as specified in the description. These ingredients appeared to release significantly different amounts of glucose between 0 20 minutes RDS fraction and 20 120 minutes SDS fraction after start of the test. The results are plotted in the figure below.
