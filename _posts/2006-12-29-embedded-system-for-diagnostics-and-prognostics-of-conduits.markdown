This is a division of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 966 397 filed Sep. 28 2001 which claims priory from Provisional Patent Application No. 60 236 432 filed Sep. 28 2000 which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

This invention was made with Government support under SBIR Contract Number N68335 98 C 0036 awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates generally to a set of sensors for enhancing safety reducing failures of systems that carry exclusively or as mixtures electrical optical electromagnetic signals fluids gases or solids by determining and locating the identity of stress factors stressors that cause deterioration and damage affecting the health status and integrity of conduits and conductive paths as well as components thereof including cladding insulating materials conductors and the signals or media they transport. More particularly it relates to a set of sensors constructed with a combination of active and passive discrete sensors and strands of sensitized media used in situ for automated inspection periodically or in real time or during periodic inspection with visual instruments or automated means to pro actively identify measure diagnose and prognose damage and deterioration as well as the causes thereof.

Structures that support transport of diverse electrical and electromagnetic signals fluids gases and solids can be called conduits . This application uses the term conduit for any structure supporting transport that can fail from accumulated damage or deterioration such as a cable cable bundle hydraulic or pneumatic hoses pipes or fuel lines. Conduits and conduit components deteriorate over time and are frequently damaged due to stress factors called Stressors including but not limited to abrasion vibration stresses strains chemicals and heat that exist both without and within conduits. If left undetected and allowed to take its course the damage caused by stressors can cause damage of said components grounding shorting leaks of substances carried in the conduits. The damage can occur in moments or take an extended period of time. Often the failure happens unexpectedly before a system s operator knows of the problem.

In practice conduits are usually encased by an insulating material and sometimes sheathed with one or more layers of cladding to assure continued functionality and safety. In certain situations it is important to know the degree of risk and status of health and integrity of conduits contained conductors and related components that comprise them. Conduits and systems of conduits may carry electrical power fuel other fluids pneumatics optical or electromagnetic signals. Deterioration and damage to cladding and insulation can be and often is a precursor to a failure in a system. Damages to interconnection systems includes but are not limited to chafing due to vibration corrosion due to caustic chemicals incisions due to sharp edges stress and strain due to motion burning oxidation reduction and other chemical reactions as well as chemical and physical degradation due to aging.

We focus now on aircraft wiring as conduits although the following statements have broad application in other uses for conduits of other types in other applications. In older fly by cable aircraft chafed cut electrical harnesses control cables and hydraulic conduits used to control flight surfaces landing gear fuel supplies and engines have been known to cause loss of control of the aircraft and fatal crashes as in the American Airlines DC 10 crash at O Hare Airport on May 25 1979 in the report of the National Transportation Safety Board a non patent document cited as reference 1. In current fly by electric aircraft damaged electrical wiring with exposed conductors are known to result in electrical shorts resulting in numerous instances of fire crashes and fatality. For example damage to or deterioration of electrical conduits has been implicated as root cause of failure in a report by the Canadian Civil Aviation Authority as a probable cause the Swissair flight 111 MD 80 a non patent document cited as reference 2. Deterioration of electrical wiring is cited as a probable cause of the explosion in the center fuel tank of TWA flight 800 Boeing747 in the report of the National Transportation Safety Board a non patent document cited as reference 3. A similar situation exists with fiber optic conduits being used in emerging fly by light aircraft control systems.

Severe chafing can cause exposure or damage to the conduit or that which is causing the chafe. In either case the results can be catastrophic as witnessed by the report of the NTSB investigation of the crash of a V 22 aircraft in 2000 a non patent document cited as reference 4. In this instance the cause of the crash was attributed to chafing by electrical conduits resulting in chafe through of a titanium hydraulic conduit releasing its contents. By law or decision in recognition of sufficient risk conduits are usually required to have reactive safety devices such as electrical circuit breakers temperature and pressure sensors and relief valves as the means to protect against hazards. In many cases visual and intrusive inspections are used to assure functionality and safety. However recent studies of intrusive inspections indicate that the procedures can do more harm than good by disturbing and damaging otherwise healthy materials. A recent investigation and report released in June 2001 by the US Federal Aviation Administration Aging Transport Systems Rulemaking Advisory Committee published in 2000 a non patent document cited as reference 5 found that careless intrusive inspections can be a significant risk of causing damage to aircraft wiring.

Damage to aircraft conduits is known to cause catastrophic failure due to loss of signals to control systems loss of hydraulic fluid and other situations. Even when control systems remain intact toxic fumes and dense toxic smoke from smoldering or fire can make it impossible for a pilot to safely fly the aircraft. Intense heat from burning aromatic polyimide electrical wiring insulation and other combustibles can melt other insulation in seconds leading to collateral damage more shorts and further loss of control. As a result commercial aircraft are now required to have smoke detector alarms. Soon they are expected to incorporate apparatus disclosed in patents by Haun et al U.S. Pat. No. 6 259 996 and Fleege et al U.S. Pat. No. 6 242 993 called arc fault circuit breakers that act to interrupt in real time on detection of arcing electrical faults but it may be too late to avert disaster.

Considering the extreme safety hazards of loss of control toxic fumes toxic smoke fires or fuel tank explosions of aircraft it is not only important to know that deterioration or damage such chafing arcing or cut wires has occurred but also that a situation exists that likely will cause it to happen during flight. It would be very desirable therefore to have an advance warning or corrective action initiated by an in line or in situ passive means for the purpose of detecting evidence of significant causes of deterioration damage and failure of conduits as well as the degree of ongoing deterioration and damage. It would be even more desirable if electricity was not the means of detection of said ongoing deterioration and damage.

A patent disclosure for a set of discrete sensors and strands of sensitized materials for the said purposes was not evidenced during our year 2001 searches of patent databases.

Our search of patent databases discovered over one hundred patents that deal with detection of faults in electrical signals detection of damage and deterioration in electrical conductors and likewise in electrical insulation along with patents of similar nature applied to deterioration and damage of pipelines fiber optic networks and other conduits.

The following discussion presents limitations of prior art or those aspects not covered by prior art that are addressed by the present invention. For brevity only the most significant limitations of each category of prior art are included.

Currently nothing is in wide use that combines detection of stressors detection and diagnosis of damage to a conduit in progress and prognosis of risk of conduit failure and system failure. The disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 4 988 949 by Boenning et al is limited to detecting mechanical damage chafing on electrical cables against grounded structures under constant monitoring. The disclosure of U.S. Pat. No. 6 265 880 by Born et al discloses use of a length of electrical conducting media such as a wire along the outside of a conduit to detect mechanical damage chafing and improves on said Boenning s patent by teaching periodic testing and detecting chafing on conduits other than electrical cables and detecting chafing against a non electrically grounded structure.

Watkins patent U.S. Pat. No. 5 862 030 teaches an electrical safety device comprised of a sensor strip disposed in the insulation of a wire or in the insulation of a sheath enclosing a bundle of electrical conductors where the sensor strip comprises a distributed conductive over temperature sensing portion comprising an electrically conductive polymer having a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity which increases with temperature sufficient to result in a switching temperature. Said Watkins patent also teaches use of electricity with a mechanical damage chafing sensing portion comprised of a strip disposed in the sheath in a mechanical damage sensing pattern which like said Born s patent becomes damaged or open upon mechanical damage of the sheath before the bundle of conductors are damaged. Watkins patent does not teach a means to perform detection of mechanical damage without use of an electrically conductive sensor material.

Currently nothing is in wide use to detect measure and diagnose onset of damage by simultaneous stressors. Currently nothing is in wide use detect and diagnose damage to conduits with mixed conductors such as electrical power electrical signal and optical signal conductors in a single bundle. Use of uncontained electrical signals is often dangerous and hazardous especially when conduits carry flammable or explosive matter yet currently nothing is in wide use that enables detection of chafing or other damage by non electrical means. Currently nothing is in wide use that diagnoses the likely stressor or estimates the likely risk and progress of damage and future damage or predicts the remaining useful life of a conduit. Currently nothing is in wide use that operates in situ on or in the conduit in a timely fashion to warn and possibly pre empt catastrophic damage that would otherwise occur.

Thus there exists a need for a means to detect and identify multiple types of stressors to quickly measure and interpret multiple types of damage including but not limited to mechanical damage chafing all prior to any damage to the internal structure of a conduit or to systems in the vicinity of the conduit. Further there exists a need for a means to provide information of type and amount of damage with identity of stressors and rate of damage to estimate in a timely fashion the risks of future damage. Further there exists a need for a means to mark multiple points of damage to aid in repair and remediation.

Prior art disclose techniques with real time signal processing to detect intermittent arcing to ground series arcs and parallel arcs in electrical wiring due to brief wiring shorts. Fleege et al U.S. Pat. No. 6 242 993 and Haun et al U.S. Pat. No. 6 246 556 use an electrical circuit and signal processing algorithms as part of an arc fault detecting electrical circuit breaker to identify arcing faults but cannot locate the place where the arc fault occur. Baldwin et al U.S. Pat. No. 6 249 230 discloses a ground fault detection system and ground fault detector to identify but not locate the place of ground faults. These patents dealing with arc and ground faults have limitation because they do not assist detection before the problem occurs and does not assist repairmen in locating the place of where the problem occurs in order to correct the situation and any damage caused. The present invention overcomes limitations of the said arc and ground fault circuit breakers for three reasons. First the present invention detects conditions prior to when faults occur. Second the present invention does not require signal processing algorithms signal digitizer or signal processor to accomplish detecting intermittent faults by using sensed evidence of damage to the sensitized strands at the point of the fault. Third the location of the intermittent fault can be determined by the marking or by other means such as reflectometry on a damaged strand capable of supporting electromagnetic waves or measurement of the amount of light contained in the damaged strand of a fluorescent doped fiber compared to previously measured level of light in the fiber before damage.

For short exposed distances some emerging methods and apparatus provide inspection with automated measuring instruments employing means such as digital processing of images made with ionizing radiation ultrasound heat and radar presented at the 2000 Aging Aircraft Symposium in St. Louis Mo. referenced as non patent document 6. Such methods have limitations due to the subjective nature of reading the images distance from the conduit and masking caused by structural members and clamps attached to conduits. Such methods require removing such impediments focusing on and changing proximity to the impediments or other intrusive means and this action can lead to damage where none existed before. More importantly the procedure to detect tiny yet important damage in images other than made by x ray is invasive requiring rotation to obtain 360 degree inspection. When the size of the conductors are smaller than 16 gage such invasive practice is well known to cause damage by twisting and disturbing the conduits especially when the conduits are embrittled with age. The present invention overcomes said limitations by operating at the surface of the conduit providing direct evidence.

It is a limitation when prior art such as Hiller U.S. Pat. No. 5 218 307 and Miskimins U.S. Pat. No. 6 230 109 that require manual intervention when inspecting electrical and conduits of hazardous materials for defects and failures. The present invention overcomes this limitation by being laid on or in the conduit before damage occurs and has built in interface to automated remote inspection techniques such as reflectometry wireless couplings and end to end tests.

The current invention is a means for determining the health status of conduit components conduit sections and systems that utilize conduits. Briefly stated the method is comprised of the steps of determining the requirements for monitoring the system of conduits defining the functions of the distributed computers diagnostic and prognostic software to meet the requirements selecting the parameters to be sensed and monitored selecting the components consisting of electronics hardware software firmware and set of discrete sensors and strips of sensitized media to implement the functions designing and manufacturing the form and fit of the monitoring device comprised of said components applying placing attaching or embedding the monitoring apparatus in a conduit and placing the discrete sensors and strands of sensitized media along the length of said conduit. The purpose of the discrete sensors is to measure characteristic parameters of the conduits and stress causing factors. The said strands of sensitized media each having a first end and a second end being placed such that damage inducing factors such as an a solid object gas liquid powder or electromagnetic waves contacts said media prior to contacting said conduit. The combination of discrete sensors and strands of sensitized media provide a means for determining by a combination of measurement and deductive algorithms whether when and where and to what extent said damage inducing factors have damaged each of said multiplicity of sensitized media. Algorithms of a monitoring application use the said determinations along with other a priori data to infer damage or pending damage to conduit components conduit sections and systems of conduits.

This invention has the objective to enhance the safety performance reliability and longevity of systems that utilize conduits by sensing causes of damage and evidence of deterioration of components. Conduits in this context include but are not limited to electrical conductors optical conductors harnesses assembled from a multiplicity of combinations of electrical or optical conductors pipelines for transporting liquids and gases hydraulic and fuel lines heating cores and tapes aqueducts and sewers. Components of said conduits in this context include but are no means limited to the supports cladding insulation junctions electronics and conductors that embody said conduit and the media transported by the conduit. Causes in this context include but are not limited to chemicals mechanical stress erosion corrosion radiation wetness oxidation reduction electricity contaminants the media transported processes used in manufacturing and installation and actions of persons that install inspect repair and maintain the said conduits.

Therefore one object of the present invention is to combine detection of onset of damage by a wide variety of stressors and perform diagnosis and prognosis of damage to a conduit before damage to the conduit occurs.

Another object is to provide a means to locate places where damage has occurred and coincidentally locate a place on the stressor as well.

Another object is to provide a means to diagnose damage to predict future damage and to prognose risk of conduit failure and system failure.

Another object is to provide a means to sense and locate damage that does not depend on electricity to excite sensor material or read the sensor.

A final object is to provide a means that operates on or in the conduit in a timely fashion to warn of damage in progress and possibly pre empt catastrophic damage that would otherwise occur.

Accordingly besides the objects and advantages described above paragraphs several objects and advantages of the present invention are 

Patent searches in preparation of this application have not found prior art that provides a means for enabling real time automated probabilistic identification of the cause. Said searches also have not found prior art that provides a means for automatically and in real time marking of surface at points damage as a means for assisting in remediation and repair thereof. Said searches have not found prior art that utilize combinations of coated hollow filled doped fibers and otherwise sensitized strands as a means for detecting and identifying stressors or detecting and locating damage to the conduit insulation and by implication the conductor therein.

There is an important and significant advantage in using data from measurements of characteristic parameters of strands of sensitized media and in particular strands that detect damage without the use of electrical excitation or interrogation. Individually the purpose of the sensitized strands constructed in the manner of the present invention detect and provide data on damage and condition s that could lead to damage such as ingress of fluids.

There are important and significant advantages to employing the invention such as the ability to determine that damage to the sensitized media is taking place that infers or current damage to the insulation and eventually damage to the conducting core. In the case of electrical conduits or conduits of dangerous chemicals such damage detected early could mean the difference between life and death. As a minimum the invention has the advantage to implement condition based maintenance which is a procedure of choice in maintaining important systems such as pipelines conduits electrical systems communication systems data systems and other uses of conduits. In any event there is the advantage of having the ability to accurately detect locate and infer the presence of the damaging stressors that will be of use to the inspector or repair person. This will be of particular advantage to inspectors and maintainers when the system of conduits is not easily inspected perhaps hidden inside a wall buried underground in space systems aircraft and undersea. The advantages are not limited to situations involving the conductive core and extend to the insulation material and other protection devices. An example of such an advantage is found in aircraft wiring systems where insulation is made from aromatic polyimide called Kapton which is known to explode and cause fires when the insulation degrades over time to form carbide molecules which release flammable acetylene gas when wet.

It is an advantage that the present invention can be implemented with an integral microcontroller for real time in situ sensitized media and sensor management data processing and communications.

It is an advantage of the present invention that it can be so constructed in other embodiments without a microcontroller and signal generators in a manner that facilitates attachment of the microcontroller or other suitable processor signal generators and ancillary electronics during manual inspections without disassembly of the conduit.

It is an advantage of the present invention that it can be configured within the surface of a conduit or it can be placed on or can be sleeved over the conduit surfaces. The present invention thus enhances and protects the existing insulating and protecting material while providing enhancements to current visual inspection techniques and also to inspection using non visual measurement systems during operations inspections tests and repairs. When embodied in or added to an interconnection system system of conduits or pipeline the invention provides a means for ready and accurate determination of the presence cause location degree of stress and degree of damage by a variety of commercially available fibers measurement devices and instruments.

The present invention has the advantage to provide inspectors with a means to remotely locate and measure stressors and assess damage by stressors in accessible and inaccessible areas.

The present invention has the ability to detect onset of damage to the insulator and its protective coating if any. This is a definite advantage over finding after the fact an electrical fault in the conduit.

It is an advantage of the present invention that safety risks are avoided because the present invention enables use of light sound microwaves pressure and other non electrical means to sense locate and determine causes of damage avoiding the safety risks inherent in using electricity.

Briefly stated the present invention is a means to detect multiple forms of damage to a conduit and perform diagnosis prognosis related to condition and remaining useful life of said conduit thereby reducing the chance of failure of any system that would be damaged or whose function would be impaired by damage to the conduit. Such a system could carry electrical power optical or electromechanical signals fuel or other fluids may be hydraulic or pneumatic or may carry solids such as particles.

The present invention is a means for obtaining data comprised of a combination of a set of discrete sensors and a multiplicity of strands of sensitized media placed on into or woven as a sheath substantially surrounding a conduit and that when attached to sleeved over or embedded into said conduit provides a means whereby to collect data to detect locate and reason the existence cause and degree of stress or damage to the sensitized media themselves and by programs and algorithms in a microcontroller or other computer to sense detect locate and reason risk of damage of the conduit.

Throughout this application the term strands mean elongated forms of substances such as strips fibers tubes filaments of diverse materials and dimensions with excitable strands in this context are those strands that can carry signals. Non excitable strands in this context are strands that are not intended or not conditioned to carry signals and serve another purpose like a marker strand and said strands can be entirely selected of optical electrically opaque media sensitized with coatings claddings and non metallic materials so as to eliminate any possibility of electrification of the strands.

Damage caused by external stressors including but not limited to corrosive chemicals heat structures and maintenance actions is detected by wrapping the conduit with a set of strands of sensitized media such as treated clad or coated hollow or solid fibers. The sensing elements are positioned so that damage caused by a stressor breaks erodes corrodes punctures or breaks one or more of the sensing elements. Measuring the end to end integrity of still measurable sensing elements or performing other tests on them determines whether each has failed thereby indicating that the conduit s integrity will be compromised unless remedial action is taken.

According to one embodiment of the invention a means for detecting damage of a conduit comprises steps of placing adjacent the conduit surface an effective length of a pattern of sensitized media being located so that a stressor cannot damage the conduit without substantially damaging a strand of sensitized media determining and storing characteristics of the installed apparatus performing measurements during operation in a periodic or continuous fashion on the sensitized media analyzing the measurements comparing the measurements against the stored characteristic measurements determining damage by examining the integrity of the sensitized media or other processing deducing the likely identity of the stressors diagnosing the meaning of the damage with respect to the conduit predicting the degree and intensity of the expected damage to the conduit prognosing the remaining useful life of the conduit without remediation updating the algorithms and parameters taking any programmed actions such as if isolating damaged stressors sensitized media and as programmed messaging the status of damage integrity and remaining useful life for awareness by the operators of the system.

In its current status of development the technology of the present invention is being first manufactured for aircraft wiring systems with flight testing in 2002. A major advantage of the present invention is that it has a three tier hierarchy of a central processor linked to local processors called sector managers and processors in the apparatus attached to the conduits. This hierarchy is implemented utilizing advanced artificial intelligence algorithms for pattern recognition machine learning and other techniques to use probability and statistics for highly accurate diagnostics and prognostics. The current implementation incorporates mechanisms and algorithms for artificial intelligence to learn causal factors and learn the effects of damage from experience dealing with past instances of damage and repair.

Referring now to which shows diagrammatically an example of a set of sensors which are strips and strands of sensitized substances each that transport light and positioned on the surface of a conduit so that together do not form an electrical circuit. Items labeled are made up of a substance that is chemically doped to cause emission of measureable amounts of fluorescent light when exposed to ultraviolet rays . Strips labeled are dielectric and block flow of electricity among the set of sensors. Items labeled are coated with a base metal over an optically transparent substance and are electrically conductive but any electrical signal is blocked by items labeled Non electrically conductive optically transparent strips are located end to end with other sensitized strips made up of optically transparent material . Similarly electrically conductive strips made of optically transparent material formed with an electrically conducting material are located end to end with said other sensitized strips and . Note that dielectric strands are placed so as to block forming of an electrical circuit. A point of damage on one of the electrically conductive strips allows white light to escape reducing the overall previous measure of white light . A second point of damage on the surface of a UV sensitized strip allows UV light to enter the sensitized strip causing an increase in the measure of amount of fluorescent light emission .

Each figure is diagrammatic to the extent that the inner insulated core insulation protecting the core and sensitized media and are shown as each having no particular material essentially no thickness no particular separation distance between materials and no particular predefined pattern. However the material thickness of the said sensitized media and pattern can be selected to provide calibration of the degree of ingress of the damage. For example a thicker aluminum or corrodible metallic element will withstand more corrosion than a thinner element of the same width and material. For example a tight pattern of millimeter size elements will reduce chance for not detecting millimeter size damage. and have diagrammatic points for attaching connections from the signal generators to the coupling is not representative of any particular configuration. Each figure is also diagrammatic with respect to other symbols that represent test signals damage and microcontroller . The supporting surfaces have no particular description except as to be not causing cross talk or other confounding situations. The discrete sensors have no particular sensory capability other than being suitable for use with the microcontroller . Similarly the debris or leakage has no particular attribute other than having at least one property useful in locating points of damage . The types of sensitized strands are only representative of those compatible with single ended measurement. Finally the symbol used for a spool is only for illustrative of a means to apply strands on a supporting medium.

In order to achieve the objectives of the above mentioned the present invention is a means for monitoring a system of conduits for the purpose of determining health states that works by processes that are the means to obtain baseline and learn from data the means to learn and fuse data to probabilistically assess causal factors of damage the means to quantify the state of deterioration and damage that has occurred the means to assess the risk that a situation exists that likely will soon cause deterioration or damage to happen and the means to formulate and communicate messages about the health state deterioration damage risks of damage and causal factors.

The set of discrete sensors and strands of material are each naturally sensitive or specifically made to be sensitive to stressors or the damage caused thereby by coating cladding or doping or other means with at least one media substance specific to a class of anticipated stressor or anticipated damage caused by stressors.

In a preferred embodiment the set of sensors is used with at least one electronic processing device of type called a microcontroller or an interface to another suitable processor with ability to digitize process and perform prestored algorithms of calculus and logic interface with the said strands and

Signal generators in this context are electronic pneumatic optical audio or other signals needed to extract data from excitable strands.

Discrete sensors in this context are devices that serve a purpose to provide data on environmental internal physics etc. and may be located at a distance communicating by wired or wireless means to the microcontrollers.

The said multiplicity of heterogeneous sensitized strands heterogeneous discrete sensors and microcontrollers serve as a means for sensing detecting locating measuring and messaging in real time about deterioration and damage to sensitized media conduits and threats thereto.

In accordance with the present invention the strands of sensitized media are sensitized so as to provide a means to detect and differentiate causes of damage to a conduit and components thereof or damage occurring in the conduit due to internal factors.

In accordance with the present invention the set of sensors is constructed as a layer sleeve or tape made a multiplicity of said strands of media coated doped and otherwise sensitized to anticipated conditions within and external to said conduits then adding the constructed apparatus as an applique sheathing weaving or winding to the outer or inner surface of the conduit.

In accordance with the present invention a substrate mesh or surface on which to form overlay or attach the set of sensors is selected of suitable material.

In accordance with the present invention the sensitized media can be made up of piecewise pieces of heterogeneous media placed layered side by side or end to end each piece when stimulated either emitting light waves or exciting light waves of the sensor or releasing light waves from the sensitized media and could be of any size with respect to said supporting surface. Further the individual patterns can be electrically conductive as long as they do not introduce unintended side effects or electrical conductivity end to end for the length of the sensor.

The preferred embodiment involves installing a set of sensors constructed of a multiplicity of selected commercially available discrete sensors and a multiplicity of commercially available sensitized strands coated doped or clad with specific sensor properties affixed in a largely parallel pattern on a suitable insulating substrate such as a fluoropolymer like EFTE EFTE CTFE FEP and PFA or mylar or polyimide. The set of sensors is either directly attached to a conduit woven in an insulated mesh or woven among conductor strands or on an insulating substrate that is subsequently affixed to a conductor or conduit. In service the preferred embodiment is coupled by wire or wirelessly to a remote computer such as a commercially available palm laptop or desktop model.

The said microcontroller or other computer provides the means to collect and process data obtained from the said strands of sensitized media and from said discrete sensors with algorithms to detect and probabilistically determine extent of damage as well as predict future damage and the progression of effects of failures on the system served by the conduit.

The said set of sensors provide the means to sense local configuration usage threat and environmental data. Types of said discrete sensors include but are not limited to devices for measuring humidity and temperature and other evidence such as odors from combustion byproducts. The said set of sensors provide the means to detect deterioration and damage as well as detect factors that would affect the conduit and the service it provides.

The said set of sensors are selected for each application primarily as a means to provide data about deterioration damage or causal factors and secondarily to provide a means to indicate places where deterioration damage or threat of damage exists. In a preferred embodiment the strands would be laid out in a measurable pattern that surrounds the conduit such as those shown in the FIG. and . In a preferred embodiment a pattern of said strands of sensitized media around the conduit should repeat their pattern in a space of less than one centimeter.

The said multiplicity of strands of sensitized media being placed such that damage inducing factors such as an a solid object gas liquid powder or electromagnetic waves contacts said media prior to contacting said conduit provide data for determining by a combination of measurement by signal processing and deductive algorithms whether when and where and to what extent said damage inducing factors have damaged each of said multiplicity of said strands.

Referring now to which shows a diagrammatic views of how damage to one or more sensitized media provides evidence for determining the cause of damage. For illustration the sensitized media in comprise a strand of translucent fiber doped with a substance that fluoresces when exposed to ultraviolet coated with an opaque piezoelectric material a strand of optically transparent fiber coated with base metal e.g. aluminum a strand of optically transparent fiber coated with a noble metal e.g. gold and a strand of silica fiber coated with a fluorescent polyimide buffer . The four media to used throughout are for example only. The five sub diagrams in show how evidence from damage to the sensitized media is readily combined to infer the probable cause of damage. Logic combining the temporal order of damage indicated in a test and type of the conductive elements affected with damage can be used to assess the type degree and speed of ingress of damage. For example discontinuity to one material caused by hydraulic fluid would not affect a metallic surface and damage due to acid corrosion of a metallic surface would not affect a sensitized media made with a noble metal a plastic or a polymer. This evidence can be processed with artificial intelligence algorithms such as a Neural Network Bayesian Belief Network or Boolean Logic truth table to derive the probable causal factors.

Referring now to which shows a pattern of heterogeneous sensitized media laid linearly in parallel fashion as helices with as small a pitch between media as possible formed on the outer or inner surface . The surface could be a sleeve or tube made of suitable dielectric or other material suitable for the purpose of separating the sensitized strands. The said pattern of sensitized media could be on the exterior the interior or formed as a matrix with the inter spatial material to form a sleeve or tube. A plurality of sensitized media can be placed on both upper and lower surfaces. The calculation of distance by the sensor instrument algorithm can be used to discern which side or edge of the ribbonized conduits is being damaged. The pattern of sensitized media can be formed on a sleeve so as to enclose a single conduit or a bundle of conduits. If the sleeve is made of shrinkable material it can be slipped and shrunk over the insulation or itself be made of an insulation. The pattern of sensitized media can be of diverse materials such as optical strands metal strands or organic strands formulated to sense or to act as waveguides or transmission lines. The type of signal is specific to the sensitized media and could be electricity sound light radio frequency or other signal appropriate to the sensitized media. The arrangement of the strands of sensitized media in patterns can be coaxial or at any angle consistent for measurement of the path to damage conduit s . The patterns can be touching one another if they are surface compatible such as non metal media surface touching metal surface media.

Referring now to which shows diagrammatically a pattern of sensitized media formed onto a surface of suitable material such as a dielectric which is placed onto the insulation protecting the core and or the conduit core . The surface could be adhesive or other means such as thermal shrinking could be used as the form of attachment. Points of attachment for the leads from the instrument can be positioned if desired anywhere along the said sensitized media. The pattern of sensitized media can be applied in a helical fashion as shown if omni directional coverage is needed.

Referring now to which shows diagrammatically an alternative pattern of sensitized media laid coaxially along a surface . The pattern can be repeated to encircle the insulation for omni directional coverage. The use of co linear sensitized media has the advantage that it can be slit to fit over the conduit. The discussion about applies to this configuration as well.

Referring now to which shows diagrammatically alternative embodiment number with the microcontroller can be separated from the apparatus yet connected to the arrangement of strands. The microcontroller can be located on a conduit connected to the said conduit serving both conduits and thereby saving costs such weight space and money. shows a sensored conduit built with discrete sensors and with a pattern of sensitized media embedded on the inner surface of a sleeve in accordance with this invention is illustrated as applied to an insulation protecting the core surrounding a conduit core . The pattern of different sensitized media are shown along the length of the insulation in side by side spirals. This embodiment provides initial protection of the plurality of sensitized media so that if ingress of damage due to stressors occurs the various materials are at risk and as discontinuity of any sensitized media occurs the spatial location of the damage can be measured by reflectometry signal strength remaining or other remote means. The cause of the damage can be interpreted by algorithms that take into account possible stressors and the damage inflicted to the sensitized media. A preferred embodiment shows a coupling that contains the microcontroller shown in the offset area inside dashed lines as well as a discrete sensor . The coupling is attached to the individual members of the discrete sensor and to the sensitized media with a suitable attachment point . The method of attachment can be any low impedance connection. The attachment points may be of a form such as detents clamps holes posts or screws or in the alternative the coupling may be welded or otherwise coupled or permanently fastened to the sensitized media. The coupling itself which may be of the so called BNC type have an outer shell and a center holding a plurality of conduits. The outer shell of a coupling is connected to one or more of the conductive elements such as the sensitized media . An attachment point provides a convenient way to connect the discrete sensors to the microcontroller instrument and connections from the test signal generators .

A person familiar with the art of sensoring and using algorithms would know that estimating the speed and depth of damage can be accomplished by an inference algorithm that incorporates spatial parameters of the system of conduits and spatial parameters that describe where the set of discrete sensors and the sensitized strands are located such as placement of sensitized strands atop one another so that when each in turn is damaged the depth of damage is determined. Cross talk caused by separated adjacent conduits will not generally be a problem because measurements will usually be performed serially. Non interfering patterns of discrete sensors and sensitized strands such as one for voltage and one for light waves can be laid touching side by side to avoid even a tiny gap that might lead to having an undetected point of damage. Conflicting conducting patterns such as gold and aluminum which both conduct electricity will need spatial clearance or a suitable spacing material to avoid forming junctions cross talk or other confounding situations. The pattern of conducting elements can be applied singularly or en masse as an applique embossed on a non conducting substrate such as polyimide or a fluoropolymer such as EFTE. Or the pattern of conducting elements can be extruded or embossed directly onto the insulation surface. Whatever the type of pattern helical coaxial wavy etc. that is used all distances to a point of damage are also defined.

A person familiar with using sensors and sensoring methods for locating sites of damage in a branched tree of conduits would understand that in any embodiment one or more additional couplings with or without a microcontroller and discrete sensors can be attached to the pattern of sensitized media at locations spaced apart from the first coupling so that differential measurements can be taken at the couplings. The additional information from such measurements at another point of the branches will accurately resolve any ambiguities caused by a plurality of sensitized media in a branched tree of conduits.

A person familiar with sensoring would understand that in the case of very long conduits perhaps over 1000 meters it may be necessary to add additional processors at distanced points probably at connectors as determined by the range of effectiveness of individual sensors.

While the current invention is described mostly in connection with a presently preferred embodiment thereof those skilled in the art will recognize that any modifications and changes may be made therein without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention which accordingly is intended to be defined solely by the appended claims. For instance in and three distinct sensor elements are shown but there could be any number arranged in any order. Any person familiar with performing tests for conductivity and reflectometry will concur that any number of sensitized media laid in patterns of any non interfering arrangement can be utilized.

All of the embodiments above offer the following advantages over present techniques. The present invention detects many damages other than chafing caused by many other causes than abrasion or incision. It matters not whether the conduit is operating or not operating. The present invention detects damage due to virtually all and every stressor by selecting sensitized strands specific to each damaging factors of each stressor. The present invention can be implemented to operate from manual to fully automatic.

Clearly many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. Which embodiment to employ depends on the application. The choice should be left to system engineers and experts in operating the systems to be protected. It should be therefore understood that within the scope of the inventive concept the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically claimed.

Operation of the invention is accomplished by selecting and procuring or making the set of discrete sensors and strands of sensitized media appropriate to the environment damage causing factors and the conduit assembling the largely parallel arrangement of said strands onto the support media adding the points and connections to the electronics if any adding appropriate sensors if any and authoring algorithms and rules for running in the microcontroller if any installing the set of sensors and strips of sensitized media onto or into the conduit performing tests for operability install the apparatus onto or into the conduit activate with a suitable power source if any .

Generally speaking employing the current invention comprises a sequence of steps. A first step is creating the said set of sensors and strips of sensitized media the said monitoring apparatus and algorithms to periodically monitor at least a portion of the system of conduits at given points in time over a first extended period and for each point in time storing in a digital memory a data couplet containing information concerning the parameters and the point in time using digital processors to identify couplets having normal values within a predetermined range and providing an indication of steady state characteristics if the readings for at least a predetermined number of couples are within a first predetermined range and providing a programmed diagnostic algorithm for assessing risk of damage and extent of deterioration and damage to the monitored conduits and providing a prognostic algorithm for estimating the remaining useful life of the monitored conduits and components and providing a protocol for communicating the information about sensed damage deterioration as well as diagnostic and prognostic information concerning the health status and integrity of the monitored conduits. Then performing a first test sequence on each of the multiplicity of the set of sensitized media for the purpose of forming a baseline of characteristic parameters of each said media for future reference by measuring the characteristics and storing the characteristics in accessible storage media or location for future use. Then from time to time performing the same said test sequence on each of the multiplicity sensitized media determining if said measured characteristics are substantially equal to previously measured characteristics the possible outcomes being a. there is no measurable change to the sensitized portion of the media b. there is measurable change to the sensitized portion of the media c. the media is disrupted i.e. broken eroded cut through or dissolved choosing whether to repeat said step of measuring and said step of determining at another point of said media if the choice is to repeat then repeating said steps of measuring and determining. Analyses using deductive algorithms along with any a priori probability information is used to a process data from said measuring of said set of discrete sensors and said multiplicity of sensitized media into characteristic information and b determine any change of said characteristics from baseline characteristics and c record the information for later use and d choosing whether to measure the position of the change if the choice is to measure then measure the location of the change using either direct calculation based on the response to the applied signal or apply a measuring technique such as reflectometry on a waveform conducting media and record the measured value and temporal information if available and using a calculus estimate the degree of damage for each said sensitized media at each recorded point of damage for each time if temporal information is recorded.

In operation the set of discrete sensors and strands of sensitized media encasing the segments will be affected by stressors operating on them. End to end tests or single ended tests such as measuring light or reflectometry can be used to detect damage to any sensitized media able to carry the waveforms. On detection of said damage algorithms such as trending pattern matching fuzzy logic distance calculation logic inference and data fusion to determine the type location and cause of the damage as well predict future impacts of the damage if damage is allowed to progress into the protective insulation and eventually the conducting core. Next the results of the detection location and determination of cause are used to initiate or request actions that mitigate or remove the stressor or stressors that are the cause of damage as well as corrective actions to bypass repair or otherwise deal with the damage. During said actions the damage to the interconnection system is repaired and damaged and sections of the sensitized media used in the embodiment of the invention are replaced or repaired.

In the course of reducing the invention to practice we acquired and used several commercially solid and hollow coated fiber technologies. We acquired fibers from Polymicro Technologies Fiberguide Industries and Lucent Technologies. There are literally hundreds of different commercial fiber products each with different optical properties. According to a preferred embodiment of the present patent we formed a substrate of a commercially available polyimide film. To the said substrate we attached and glued fibers that were of approximately equal diameter in a largely parallel repeated and measurable alignment. The said fibers were a fiber surface coated with a piezoelectric substance an aluminum coated fiber a gold coated fiber and a silica optical fiber coated with polyimide. We selected the piezoelectric coated fiber for its ability to generate electrical signals during abrasion to indicate evidence of rubbing. We selected the fiber coated with aluminum for the purpose to sense and locate damage of corrosion. We selected the fiber gold plated fiber as a control to differentiate chemical corrosion of aluminum from chafing and cut through laceration. We selected a silica core optical fiber coated with polyimide insulation as a control.

Next the film with the attached fibers was wrapped to surround the surface of a conduit consisting of several insulated electrical wires. We recorded the geometry variables for use in accurately measuring the distance from the end to a point of damage.

In a parallel effort we loaded commercially available software into the remote computer. We used the Matlab. . software to process sampled data and test Boolean equations and Netica. . software for making probabilistic estimates using a probabilistic calculus called a Bayesian Belief Network. Next we connected each fiber surface to the digitizing input of the microcontroller circuit and obtained and recorded characteristic measurements.

We conducted experiments using seeded damage. The experiments were successful in detecting seeded damage. The experiments consisted of salt water for slow corrosion rubbing with and without fine pumice to simulate erosion causing chafing knife cuts causing lacerations and direct flame causing quick oxidation of aluminum and melting of plastics. Data collected by the microcontroller was transmitted to the remote computer. Digitized waveforms from reflectometry were processed with a MatLab. . Time Domain Reflectometer simulator program. When a fiber filled with ink was breached the ink leaked out showing the ability to mark the point of damage. We used the Bayesian Belief Network to determine the most probable cause of damage from sensed data.

We performed tests with a commercially available encapsulated marking substance to mark points of damage caused by lacerations erosion corrosion burning arcing and dissolution. A person familiar with the art of using liquid filled fibers would recognize that when breached by a stressor the liquid filed fiber will leak fluid when a pressure differential occurs and that said pressure differentials are especially common in traversing altitudes of aircraft flight regimes.

However the accuracy of measurement is greatest when the distance between the measuring instrument e.g. a reflectometer is small and the terminating impedance is lowest.
