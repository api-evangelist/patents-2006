The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to an embedded dynamic vibration absorber. More specifically but without limitation the present invention relates to an embedded dynamic vibration absorber that resides within structural and mechanical components.

Vibrations occur during the normal operation of structural and mechanical systems. These vibrations cause components to experience fatigue and reduced service life. Typically to neutralize and or control such effects of vibration dynamic vibration absorbers are externally attached to structural and mechanical systems.

In particular such conventional dynamic vibration absorbers are designed to vibrate out of phase with respect to the vibration of the attached structural or mechanical system. This out of phase vibrational motion of the dynamic vibration absorber produces forces that counteract the vibrations of the attached structural or mechanical system.

Further such conventional dynamic absorbers may contain a viscoelastic material to provide damping. However the use of such conventional dynamic vibration absorbers presents several problems. For example external application of such absorbers generally takes place after construction and installation of the structural or mechanical system of interest entailing significant additional expense and installation time.

In addition external application of conventional dynamic vibration absorbers exposes the absorbers to the rigors of environmental and service conditions which frequently lead to damage and degradation of the dynamic vibration absorber. Moreover conventional dynamic vibration absorbers are generally capable of neutralizing and or controlling vibration in only one or two axes. Thus when utilizing conventional dynamic vibration absorbers many directions of vibration must be analyzed and determined and then several absorbers installed to attempt to counteract the various axes of vibration.

It is a feature of the invention to provide an embedded dynamic vibration absorber that includes an external structural portion and a vibrational absorbing portion. The vibrational absorbing portion is encompassed or surrounded by the external structural portion.

It is a feature of the invention to provide an embedded dynamic vibration absorber that includes a plurality of structural layers and an embedment. The structural layers are adjacent to each other and the embedment is embedded between interior layers of the structural layers. The embedment includes a mass element and a viscoelastic material the viscoelastic material surrounds the mass element.

It is a feature of the invention to provide an embedded dynamic vibration absorber that is free to respond to axial flexural and torsional vibrations. The embedded dynamic vibration absorber also provides extended vibration control.

It is a feature of the invention to provide an embedded dynamic vibration absorber that provides extended coverage and efficient operation.

It is a feature of the invention to provide an embedded dynamic vibration absorber that is protected from the environment and damage.

It is another feature of the present invention to provide a dynamic vibration absorber capable of neutralizing and or minimizing vibration in several axes.

It is a further feature of the present invention to provide a dynamic vibration absorbing structure which may be embedded into structures and or mechanical systems during or after construction thereof and which provide neutralization and or damping of vibrational effects of the structures and or mechanical systems in several axes.

The preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated by way of example below and in . The embedded dynamic vibration absorber includes an external structural portion and a vibrational absorbing portion. The vibrational absorbing portion is encompassed or surrounded by the external structural portion. The external structural portion may be plurality of axial structural layers and the vibrational absorbing portion may be an embedment . As shown in and the axial structural layers are adjacent to each other and the embedment is embedded between interior layers of the axial structural layers . The embedment includes a mass element and a viscoelastic material the mass element is encompassed or surrounded by the viscoelastic material .

As seen in the axial structural layers are adjacent to each other or substantially longitudinally parallel their respective axes substantially parallel . Several of the axial structural layers are interior layers . Interior layers may be defined but without limitation as being within inside or not in direct communication with the exterior or the outside environment.

As seen in the embedment is embedded between interior layers of the axial structural layers . The mass element is substantially completely surrounded by the viscoelastic material .

A viscoelastic material may be defined but without limitation as a material possessing both viscous and elastic behavior or a material that is plastically deformable or having the ability to dissipate vibration by converting kinetic energy to heat. The viscoelastic material may be but without limitation an acrylic polymer an elastomer a polymer an adhesive rubber any polyvinyl chloride alloy compound a vulcanized polyolefinite thermoplastic rubber urethane foams a thermoplastic or combinations of the above.

In operation by floating within the viscoelastic material the mass element vibrates out of phase with the rigid external structural portion or axial structure layers to counteract the vibration thereof. In general the mass element may be any material having a density greater than the density of the material constituting the viscoelastic material . Generally iron or lead is used as is it inexpensive and readily available. The mass element may be but without limitation constructed from metals wood structural plastics advanced composites viscous liquids gels or any material practicable. Examples of advanced composites that may be used include but without limitation graphite epoxy Kevlar Epoxy and glass epoxy. However any viscous liquids or gels capable of being contained within the viscoelastic material may be utilized.

The embedded dynamic vibration absorber may be manufactured but without limitations by using the following method placing the first ply of prepreg on a lay up tool forming the ply to the surface contour of the tool removing any wrinkles using a clean adhesive spreader placing the second ply upon the first ply and then following the above procedure and repeating ply lay down until the layer to contain the dynamic vibration absorber is reached so as to construct a lay up. Then the next steps include applying viscoelastic damping material to the surfaces of the internal portion internal mass portion so as to encompass the mass portion placing the mass on the lay up in the desired location so as to constitute a portion of the embedded mass layer filling out the embedded mass layer with sized pieces of prepreg then finishing the piece by continuing adding plies until the desired thickness is achieved. The absorber is then cured following the process schedule for the prepreg material.
