The present application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09 685 165 filed Oct. 5 2000 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 031 952 entitled Knowledge Filter which claims benefit of 60 158 496 filed Oct. 8 1999 entitled Knowledge Filter both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The present invention relates to a system and apparatus for allowing groups of individuals connected to a computer network such as the Internet to collaboratively build a self organizing knowledge base that uses ratings and commentary provided by a plurality of users to rank sort and deliver the information from the knowledge base which best matches each individual user s personal criteria for value in information.

In the last few years a well known network of interconnected computers called the Internet has made it possible for people to use personal computers linked to central systems to engage in two way information exchange. Existing systems of Internet based information exchange include NewsGroups Listservs threaded discussion forums and Online databases. Local area networks LANS and Intranets also allow people connected to private computer networks to share information among members of an organization. Network based systems differ from traditional media formats in that they allow users to contribute as well as to access information. The most common form of network based knowledge sharing technology is called threaded discussion. The format used by most threaded discussion systems pre dates the World Wide Web and is based on an older Internet protocol called Usenet. A threaded discussion is a forum where one person can post a communication start a thread and others can reply to that post or start a new thread. There are three main problems with threaded discussion 

c Once a large number of postings are added to the system it becomes unwieldy and very difficult to find the useful information among the many unedited posts.

A number of approaches have been used to try to increase the value of information in threaded discussion forums. One method of editing involves deleting older messages. Some such systems allow users to specify the age of messages that appear on their screen. In such systems older messages are lost regardless of their value. Other systems move the older messages to an archive where they can be retrieved only if the user already knows what he or she is searching for so that search terms can be used to locate relevant messages. Another type of system relies on a moderator to edit messages for value before they are posted. Moderated discussion forums or Usenet newsgroups are generally favored over un moderated ones that can quickly become clogged with redundant messages turn into shouting matches or commercial solicitations. Some of the problems with moderated discussion forums are that 

a The editorial process is placed in the hands of one person who may have personal biases that control the content of the system.

There are a number of other knowledge management systems that allow groups of people to share a central body of knowledge. Groupware systems allow individuals to contribute to or to comment on a shared document or database. These systems generally allow an authorized person or persons to accept or reject contributions made by others. Groupware systems tend to be inter active but not democratic. Another field related to the present invention is the field of polling software. Polling software is used to conduct surveys or polls on specific topics. This type of software uses database technology to track opinions and report statistics on topics that are chosen by the administrators of the system. The more sophisticated polling software systems allow users to rate items for more than one criteria.

Another related field is called collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a process that collects information on the tastes or interests of members of a group and makes predictions about what other members of the group will like based on similarities found in the collected data. This is a passive process for the user and is very different from the active process of ratings based filtering described herein.

In order to make use of the vast amount of unedited information available to a computer connected to a network such as the Internet a method of filtering must be found that will allow individuals to ascertain which pieces of information are most reliable useful or meaningful to them. If a large number of individuals are allowed to contribute knowledge and opinions to a central database a method for automatically organizing the data into a logical knowledge structure must be found. Since many people might contribute information to a database that may include a broad range of value or reliability and since many other people interested in the same subject may have experience or knowledge relating to each contribution it would be useful to create a system that would collect opinions ratings and commentary from a plurality of users and would calculate the aggregate ratings for a number of multiple criteria of value and make them available to each individual user. It would also be useful to use the rating scores as a means for sorting filtering and organizing the information in the database in accordance with the rating scores given by the group. Since each individual has a different idea of what sort of rating criteria are important to them it would also be useful to be able to dynamically sort the information in a way that most closely matches each individual s criteria for value in information. In order for a new piece of information contributed to a large database to be seen by enough people to receive ratings a method must also be found to give new postings broad exposure while retaining the system s ability to sort postings according to their group rating data. Additionally it would be useful for an individual seeking information on a subject to be able to know what the main arguments for and against a given opinion are in order to be able to make an informed decision regarding the subject. It would also be useful to provide a means of communication that would allow an individual to communicate with the provider of opinions.

The object of the present invention is to design a self organizing system that is easy to navigate easy to contribute content and opinions to and that automatically presents the information that is most meaningful or useful to an individual user to that users attention without discarding the rest of the information in the database. A further object of the invention is to provide easy to interpret visual symbols and rating data for a number of information contributions in a way that allows them to be simultaneously displayed on a computer screen before they are selected and viewed by a user. Another object of the invention is to provide the framework for such a system that can easily be adopted to a number of subjects that may have varying rating criteria and subject organization parameters.

Such a system would effectively combine a computer network s ability to store and process vast amounts of information with the distinctly human ability to discern meaning and value.

What is needed then is a system that is similar to threaded discussion but that records the reactions and additional experience of the many members of a knowledge sharing community and then uses this additional information associated with each posting to organize the database in a way that allows individual users to sort and retrieve the information from the database that is most reliable and most useful to them and to have access to both sides of controversial issues. The utility of such a system would be further enhanced if it were self organizing searchable and easy to navigate. If properly designed such a system would also facilitate the cross fertilization of ideas across academic and geographical boundaries and allow broader access to reliable information and opinion through the process which could be described as the democratization of knowledge. The present invention addresses such a need.

A method and system for sharing knowledge is disclosed. The method and system comprises receiving information input into a database and organizing items of information in the database. The method and system further includes collecting ratings and comments associated with each item of information and allowing users to access and sort items of information according to selected rating criteria in order to find the most reliable and or valuable information from the database.

In a second aspect the present invention includes a graphic user interface for providing information concerning a subject which is disclosed. The interface comprises a first area that shows the subject and contributor name and a second area that shows the content of the information item. The interface includes a third area that shows ratings related to the subject and a fourth area that allows users to submit ratings for the information item.

Accordingly a knowledge sharing system and interface are provided which allows every member of a knowledge sharing group to benefit from the aggregate knowledge experience and opinions of other members of the group. The system and method allows individual members to easily locate and filter the information from a collectively generated knowledge base that is most consistent with that individual s personal measures of value in information.

The present invention relates to a system and apparatus for allowing groups of individuals connected to a computer network such as the Internet to collaboratively build a self organizing knowledge base that uses ratings and commentary provided by a plurality of users to rank sort and deliver the information from the knowledge base which best matches each individual user s personal criteria for value in information. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment and the generic principles and features described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiment shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.

KnowledgeFilter is a knowledge sharing system which allows every member of a knowledge sharing group to benefit from the aggregate knowledge experience and opinions of other members of the group and allows individual members of the group to easily locate the information from the collectively generated knowledge base that is most consistent with that individual s personal measures of value in information. The system accomplishes these goals by 

2 Allowing members of the group to submit content to the knowledge base once they have navigated to the appropriate topic area.

3 Soliciting and tracking multi criteria ratings and pro con comments on content submissions from other members of the group.

4 Calculating and graphically displaying the aggregate feedback and commentary support level corroboration level of the group regarding each content submission.

5 Allowing users to sort the content submissions under any given topic area according to the aggregate scores for any individual rating criteria or a personally selected combination of criteria causing the most valuable content to rise to the top of a dynamically generated list of content submissions. Custom sorting allows users to assign a weighting factor to each criteria by responding to prompts.

6 Allowing users to sort the content according to the level of comment support as determined by the ratio of positive to negative comments submitted by the knowledge sharing group.

7 Allowing users to read or access the selected content in a graphic display format that also provides 

1 A knowledge base map that is automatically generated as topics and sub topics are added to the knowledge base.

2 A system of tracking rating submissions that prevents any one user from voting on a given content submission more than one time.

3 Ratings associated with individual contributors are tracked allowing content submissions to be sorted by source or contributor ranking.

4 An administrative function that allows a system administrator to edit content submissions and the knowledge base mapping structure.

5 Instant e mail links to the contributors of content or comment submissions to facilitate communication between knowledge base users with interest or knowledge in a specific topic.

6 A feature that initially displays the content submissions under a topic in order of submission date allowing new submissions to be exposed to the group for ratings and comment feedback.

The software can be used to collaboratively generate new knowledge in a specialized field as well as to combine organize access and filter existing bodies of knowledge or opinion. The basic software shell can be easily changed to adapt to any type of knowledge sharing forum.

One embodiment of the software uses a system of HTML based text color coding to allow users to quickly determine how individual contributions to a knowledge base are rated by other users. The hue and saturation of each text link in a sorted list reveals immediate information on such parameters as how consistent individual postings are with other perspectives or facts or how well a method product or idea actually works in the real world.

The server computer also includes a data storage facility so called non volatile memory on a disk drive which is used to contain the database components of the system as well as non volatile components of the software such as a copy of the operational code of the invention.

The server computer also includes within the RAM the operational software code of the system the KnowledgeFilter Server or KFS an HTTP hypertext transport protocol server also known as a Web Server or WS interfacing software called TCP IP transmission control protocol Internet Protocol for communications with remote users through the Internet . Also included within the RAM are temporary data objects created during the operation of the software. These temporary data objects are more fully described below

The server computer also includes interfacing hardware to enable it to communicative over the Internet.

The general operation of the system is as follows. To consult a KnowledgeBase using the system of the invention the remote user at sends a request for a display page on a web site located within the database on the server at . The request is routed through the Internet and is received by the Web Server in the server computer. The Web server interprets the request and passes the request to KnowledgeFilter Server. The KnowledgeFilter Server interprets the request retrieves data from the KnowledgeBase database instantiates required data objects in RAM performs necessary calculations composes a computer file commonly referred to as a web page in the Hypertext Markup Language HTML comprised of static components retrieved from the database and dynamic components derived from calculations on the data objects and then sends the resulting computer file through the interfacing equipment over the Internet back to the remote user s computer at . The remote computer at displays the resulting file through the browser software .

The knowledge base is organized as a hierarchical structured category system illustrated in . It is mapped into a database management software such as mySQL which manages the storage retrieval and editing of the database records.

There is a single table kbtable that lists as records all the categories currently in the knowledge base. The kbtable table includes the following field names for each record with the indicated data types and uses 

Each Category has its own table and the knowledge base can contain additional category tables or sub category tables etc. which can be added administratively or by a user. The Category table name is build from kbcat and the Catld. A category table consists of the following field names for each record with the indicated data types and uses 

Items are stored in an Item Table and the knowledge base can contain additional item tables etc. which can be added administratively or by a user. An Item record in the case of the example embodiment of the invention a recipe is comprised of values of the following fields with the indicated data types and uses 

In the embodiment of the invention described herein the KnowledgeFilter Server is implemented in a programming language called PHP3. During operation of the KnowledgeFilter Server various data objects are instantiated that is created in RAM in response to user actions. Each data object is a segment of code called a class. The following classes are created.

The Cat Class is a category object found in class. Cat.php3. It implements a knowledge base category and hides the database management software implementation from the user s commands. Its main methods are idInit which initializes a given database id and category id Create InsertCat and InsertItem.

The Item Class is an item object found in class.Item.php3. It implements the knowledge entry and hides the details of accessing the database and storing the object data. Its main methods are idinit which initializes item given a database id a category id and an item id and Create.

The Item Class is an iterator object found in class.Iter.php3. It implements an object that iterates through a list of objects either categories or items. Its main methods are CatIter which sets a Category Next which finds the next element and ItemIter which sets an item. The View Class is an object that allows different representations of criteria 1 through 3 plus overall grades and can also display category and items lists. The Log Class is an object used for logging user information.

The following commands are utilized in the operation of the system. The user does not have explicit access to these commands by name but rather the system invokes these commands in context in response to user input through the user interfaces described in the next section.

User Commands invoked by user actions are given in the following Table together with the software module in which the command is encoded and the action or information returned by the command.

Administrative Commands invoked by actions of an administrator are given in the following Table together with the software module in which the command is encoded and the action or information returned by the command.

2 the Navigation Area that shows links to a knowledge base map related to the subject links to search functions and links to a content submission form and a navigation index 

3 the Group Feedback Statistics Area that shows statistics related to the subject of the knowledge base 

4 the Content Window that displays the contents of an Item a recipe in the case of the example embodiment of the invention the Content Window can also be used to display results of knowledge base queries such as a category list or an index page discussed more fully below.

7 a graphic display format area which provides a side by side display of comments supporting or disputing the content submission allowing individuals to make informed decisions and choices of what to believe or what methods to use to accomplish a particular goal 

8 a graphic display format area which provides a display of other comments providing additional information links or opinions on the content submission and

The Knowledge Navigation Console also contains a graphic display format which provides graphic symbols for representing the aggregate rating scores for each criteria and for representing the level of comment support for the content submission.

1 an area in which a user can make sorting selections including sort selections from a standard list a quick sort button which presents items sorted in accordance with a default such as by date of contribution of items and a custom sort button which brings up an auxilliary display in which the user can make detailed selections rating the importance of sort criteria 

3 an area in which search links are located which when clicked bring up a context sensitive search interface shown in in which the user can enter search terms in the input window .

In another embodiment of the invention color coding of the subject descriptions corresponding to information items is used to provide a visual indication to the user of overall rating scores of the information items.

2 The user may select from a set of standard sorting options in response to which the system displays the items in the requested sorted order .

3 The user may select a quick sort which sorts the items based on a default criterion such as by date of submission in response to which the system displays the items in the requested sorted order .

4 The user may select a custom sort . The system responds by presenting a selection interface through which the user select personal preferences indicating the importance of each rating criterion assign relative weights to various rating criteria and submit a custom sorting query in response to which the system calculates a sort order based on a weighted average of the users inputs and displays the items in the requested sorted order causing the most useful content to rise to the top of the list. After any of the sorting options 2 4 described above the user can select an item for immediate viewing in display format .

The user can submit ratings of the displayed item by selecting from a range of predetermined values of rating variables through the rating submission button in the rating submission area . The system responds by adding the ratings to the aggregate values for the item and redisplaying the item . The system constrains the user by tracking and controlling the rating process to prevent the user from submitting multiple ratings of a single information item.

The system also tracks the aggregate ratings of contributors allowing content item submissions to be sorted by contributor rating or ranking within the entire system. The user can also communicate with individual contributors by automated communication links. The user can also make comments by selecting the comment interface and filling in the text area and choosing to tag the comments as positive negative or neutral by means of the radio buttons . The system responds by adding the comments to the record for the item recalculates the aggregate ratings and redisplaying the item with the aggregate ratings comments and level of comments support . From the Knowledge Navigation Console with the category list displayed the user can select to submit a new category through the Create a New Category interface . The system responds by adding the category to the list of categories and displaying the category list with the new category included.

From the Knowledge Navigation Console with the items list for a particular category displayed the user can select to submit a new item through the New Item interface . The system responds by adding the new Item to the knowledge base and displaying the category with the new Item included. Since the default sort of items is by date of submission the newly submitted item will appear at the top of the list of items. The new Item can now be viewed and rated by the same or some different user s enhancing the value of the knowledge base.

Although the present invention has been described in accordance with the embodiments shown one of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize that there could be variations to the embodiments and those variations would be within the spirit and scope of the present invention. Accordingly many modifications may be made by one or ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
