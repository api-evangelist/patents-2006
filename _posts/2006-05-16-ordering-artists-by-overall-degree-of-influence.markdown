A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. The following notice applies to the software and data as described below and in the drawings hereto Copyright 2005 Sony Electronics Incorporated All Rights Reserved.

Clustering and classification tend to be important operations in certain data mining applications. For instance data within a dataset may need to be clustered and or classified in a data system with a purpose of assisting a user in searching and automatically organizing content such as recorded television programs electronic program guide entries and other types of multimedia content.

Generally many clustering and classification algorithms work well when the dataset is numerical i.e. when datum within the dataset are all related by some inherent similarity metric or natural order . Numerical datasets often describe a single attribute or category. Categorical datasets on the other hand describe multiple attributes or categories that are often discrete and therefore lack a natural distance or proximity measure between them.

A graph of nodes and edges is used to represent artist influence between different artists. Each node of the graph represents an artist. An edge between two nodes represents an influence relationship between two artists. The relative influence between artists is computed for the artists represented in the graph. Furthermore the artists are ordered based on the computed influence.

The present invention is described in conjunction with systems clients servers methods and machine readable media of varying scope. In addition to the aspects of the present invention described in this summary further aspects of the invention will become apparent by reference to the drawings and by reading the detailed description that follows.

In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical mechanical electrical functional and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

The category data is grouped into clusters and or classified into folders by the clustering classification module . Details of the clustering and classification performed by module are below. The output of the clustering classification module is an organizational data structure such as a cluster tree or a dendrogram. A cluster tree may be used as an indexed organization of the category data or to select a suitable cluster of the data.

Many clustering applications require identification of a specific layer within a cluster tree that best describes the underlying distribution of patterns within the category data. In one embodiment organizational data structure includes an optimal layer that contains a unique cluster group containing an optimal number of clusters.

A data analysis module may use the folder based classifiers and or classifiers generated by clustering operations for automatic recommendation or selection of content. The data analysis module may automatically recommend or provide content that may be of interest to a user or may be similar or related to content selected by a user. In one embodiment a user identifies multiple folders of category data records that categorize specific content items and the data analysis module assigns category data records for new content items with the appropriate folders based on similarity.

A user interface also shown in is designed to assist the user in searching and automatically organizing content using the data system . Such content may be for example recorded TV programs electronic program guide EPG entries and multimedia content.

Clustering is a process of organizing category data into a plurality of clusters according to some similarity measure among the category data. The module clusters the category data by using one or more clustering processes including seed based hierarchical clustering order invariant clustering and subspace bounded recursive clustering. In one embodiment the clustering classification module merges clusters in a manner independent of the order in which the category data is received.

In one embodiment the group of folders created by the user may act as a classifier such that new category data records are compared against the user created group of folders and automatically sorted into the most appropriate folder. In another embodiment the clustering classification module implements a folder based classifier based on user feedback. The folder based classifier automatically creates a collection of folders and automatically adds and deletes folders to or from the collection. The folder based classifier may also automatically modify the contents of other folders not in the collection.

In one embodiment the clustering classification module may augment the category data prior to or during clustering or classification. One method for augmentation is by imputing attributes of the category data. The augmentation may reduce any scarceness of category data while increasing the overall quality of the category data to aid the clustering and classification processes.

Although shown in as specific separate modules the clustering classification module organizational data structure and the data analysis module may be implemented as different separate modules or may be combined into one or more modules.

In one embodiment data analysis module comprises interest influence module that orders the artists associated with the category data by generating an artist influence graph. One embodiment to order by artist influence is further described in below. In an alternate embodiment interest influence module generate a weighted artist influence graph. One embodiment for generating a weighted artist influence graph is further described in FIGS. and below.

Category data describes the different categories associated with the content. For example category data comprises terms Best Underway Sports GolfCategory Golf Art 0SubCulture Animation Family FamilyGeneration Child Kids Family FamilyGeneration and Child. As illustrated category data comprises fifteen terms describing the program. Some of the terms are related for example Sports GolfCategory Golf are related to sports and Family FamilyGeneration Child Kids are related to family. Furthermore category data includes duplicate terms and possibly undefined terms 0SubCulture . Undefined terms may be only associated with one program because the definition is unknown and therefore not very useful.

Artists comprise the list of artists associated with the program. For example artists comprise artist artist . . . artist. An artist can be but not limited to an actor actress producer director singer musician arranger composer choreographer painter illustrator author etc. and or any person who adds to the creative content of the program. Thus there is the possibility of a large number of artists associated with one program.

In addition there can be a large number of programs available to a customer. For example a week of television programming could have thousands of programs with thousands of individual terms describing the programs. Therefore it is possible for a customer to be presented with thousands or more artists to choose from in the programs offered through an EPG.

However a customer is likely to be interested in only a small subset of available artists. The problem lies when a customer would like to access programs with artists that not in the interested subset because of the potentially large number of additional artists.

Artists that influence another artist are referred to as an influencing artists or influencers. Conversely an artist influenced by another artist referred to as a following artist or follower. An influence means that one artist inspires teaches motivates or otherwise affects another artist. For example the composer Johan Sebastian Bach influenced Wolfgang Mozart. In turn Mozart influenced Ludwig Beethoven. Thus Bach is an influencer of Mozart and Mozart is a follower of Bach. Similarly Mozart is an influencer of Beethoven and Beethoven is a follower of Mozart.

Artist can be followers and influencers. As illustrated in artists A B are both influenced by and influence other artists. Furthermore an artist can be both a follower and influencer of the same artist. As illustrated artists A B have both a influencing and following relationship through directed edge .

In one embodiment graph is a basic artist influence graph indicating the type of influence relationship between the artists. In an alternate embodiment graph is a weighted artist influence graph indicating the type and degree of influence relationship. The degree of relationship represents the strength of influence one artist has on a following artist. The degree of relationship can be represented using visual known in the art such as node size line size color indicators font indicators etc.

At block method builds a basic graph of nodes and edges representing artist influences. The graph nodes represent artists and the graph edges connecting the nodes represent artist influences between the artists. In one embodiment method computes a graph similar to the one illustrated in . In an alternative embodiment the graph is a directed graph with one or more cycles. As stated above an influence means that one artist inspires teaches motivates or otherwise affects another artist. One embodiment of building an artist influences graph is further described in below.

At block method computes artists influences. Computing influences involves processing the basic artist influence graph to generate values of influence. Furthermore influencing artists can have varying amounts of influence on a following artist. For example one influencing artist could have a stronger influence on a particular following artist another influencing artist. One embodiment of computing influences is furthered described in below.

At block method determines the display choice for the artist graph. In one embodiment method orders the lists of artists based on the basic artist influence graph. In another embodiment method generates a weighted artist influence graph based on the relative artist influences computed at block .

If method determines the display choice is to order the artist graph method orders the list of artists based on the influence values at block . One embodiment for ordering the list of artists is further described in below.

However if method determines that the display choice is a weighted artist influence graph method takes the artist influence graph computed above and regenerates a weighted artist graph at block . The weighted artist influence is an artist graph that comprises data indicating of the degree of influence an influencing artist has relative to a following artist. In one embodiment method generates the weighted artists influence graph with artist nodes and influencing edges as in where the nodes are weighted according influence strength. Alternatively method represents the weighted artist influence graph in different ways such as graphically representing the degree of artist influence with visual cues known in the art. One embodiment of displaying the artist influence graph is further described in below.

In a further embodiment not shown method orders the lists of artists as described in block and generates a weighted artist influence graph as described in block .

If the graph does not have a node for the current artist method adds a node to the graph with the artist name at block . In one embodiment method adds the node to the graph by creating a new node setting the node name to be the artist name and inserting the node into the graph. Alternatively method can add nodes representing all the unknown artists to the graph. Execution proceeds to block .

At block method processes the artist influences. One embodiment of processing artist influence is further described in below. At block method processes the artist followers. One embodiment of processing the artist followers as further described in below. The processing beginning at ends at block .

If the influencing artist is the node table method determines if artist node has this influencer at block . If so at block method adds the influencing artist to the current artist node. By adding the influencing artist to the current artist node method builds the influencing part of the graph for current artist. Adding the influencing artist allows for the reverse relationship where the current artist is a follower of the influencing artist. Execution proceeds to block . At block method sets the artist as a follower of the influence. The processing loop ends at block .

If method determines that the artist node does not have this influencing node execution proceeds to the end of the loop at block .

If the follower is not in the follower node table method adds a follower node to the node table at block . Execution proceeds to block .

At block method adds the artist as a follower of the influencing artist. By adding the following artist to the current artist node method builds the follower part of the influence graph for current artist. The processing loop ends at block .

Method further executes an inner processing loop blocks to propagate the artist influences. Propagating the influences derives the relative weighting of an influencing artist has on a following artist. At block method recursively propagates the influences. One embodiment for propagating the influences is further described in below. The inner processing loops ends at block . Furthermore the outer processing loop ends at block .

At block method determines whether the node has been visited by method . If the node has been visited method returns the graph at block . If the node has not been visited method sets the influence share equal to the inverse of one plus the number of influences associated with current artist at block . At block method adds the node to the list of nodes visited by method .

Furthermore method executes a processing loop blocks to further propagate the influences for each influence of the current node. At block method recursively propagates the influences for the current influencing node being processed by the loop by executing blocks of . The processing loop ends at block . Execution proceeds to block . At block method returns the graph generated by method .

Method further executes a processing loop blocks to sort the artists lists for each artist influence artist follower and other similar lists. At block method gets the influences for related artists. In one embodiment related artists are the influencing and following artists for the current artists. Alternatively related artists can be related by the same and or different criteria genre year etc. . Using the related artists method sorts the artist list at block . In one embodiment method sorts the artists by influencing artists then following artists. Alternatively method sorts the artist using the same more less and or different criteria and combinations related to any of the metadata types associated with the artists genre year etc. . At block method returns the sorted lists. The processing loop ends at block .

Method further executes a processing loop blocks to generate the weighted artist influence graph based on the artists in the basic artist influence graph. At block method gets the next artist from the basic artist influence graph and creates a new weighted artist influence graph for that artist. At block method adds the influencing artist to the weighted artist influence graph up to the display depth. The display depth restricts the number of influencing artists to be displayed. The display depth may be large enough to allow display of all of the influencing artists or only some influencing artists. One embodiment for adding influencing artists is further described in below. Likewise method adds following artists to the weighted artist influence graph up to the display depth at block . The display depth for the following artists may or may not be the same as the display depth for the following artists. As with the influencing artist display depth the following artist display depth may be large enough to allow display of all of the following artists or only some following artists. One embodiment for adding following artists is further described at below. At block method generates the weighted artist influence graphs for display on the user interface. The processing loop ends at block .

At block method adds an edge between the current artist node and the influencing artist node. Adding an edge indicates the influencing relationship between the current and influencing artist. In addition the relative size of the influencing node indicates the relative influence the influencing artist has on the current artist. At block method makes the influencing node clickable so as to allow access of information associated with the influencing node. In one embodiment where the weighted artist influence graph is displayed clicking on the influencing node allows a user to access the weighted artist influence graph of the influencing node. Alternatively clicking on the influencing node produces the same and or different actions displays information about the influencing node such as but not limited to influencing artist biography discography etc. . At block method decrements the display depth by one. Method recursively adds additional influencing artists to the weighted artist influence graph up to the display depth at block . Alternatively method adds additional influencing artists using non recursively way known in the art at block . The processing loop ends at block .

At block method adds a link between the current artist node and the following artist node. Adding an edge indicates the following relationship between the current and following artist. In addition the relative size of the following node gives an indication of the relative influence the current artist has on the following artist. At block method makes the following node clickable so as to allow access of information associated with the following node. In one embodiment where the weighted artist influence graph is displayed clicking on the following node allows a user to access the weighted artist influence graph of the following node. Alternatively clicking on the following node produces the same and or different actions displays information about the following node such as but not limited to following artist biography discography etc. .

The embodiments of the invention can also be practiced in distributed computing environments where tasks are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network such as peer to peer network infrastructure.

In practice the methods described herein may constitute one or more programs made up of machine executable instructions. Describing the method with reference to the flowchart in enables one skilled in the art to develop such programs including such instructions to carry out the operations acts represented by logical blocks on suitably configured machines the processor of the machine executing the instructions from machine readable media . The machine executable instructions may be written in a computer programming language or may be embodied in firmware logic or in hardware circuitry. If written in a programming language conforming to a recognized standard such instructions can be executed on a variety of hardware platforms and for interface to a variety of operating systems. In addition the present invention is not described with reference to any particular programming language. It will be appreciated that a variety of programming languages may be used to implement the teachings of the invention as described herein. Furthermore it is common in the art to speak of software in one form or another e.g. program procedure process application module logic . . . as taking an action or causing a result. Such expressions are merely a shorthand way of saying that execution of the software by a machine causes the processor of the machine to perform an action or produce a result. It will be further appreciated that more or fewer processes may be incorporated into the methods illustrated in the flow diagrams without departing from the scope of the invention and that no particular order is implied by the arrangement of blocks shown and described herein.

The web server is typically at least one computer system which operates as a server computer system and is configured to operate with the protocols of the World Wide Web and is coupled to the Internet. Optionally the web server can be part of an ISP which provides access to the Internet for client systems. The web server is shown coupled to the server computer system which itself is coupled to web content which can be considered a form of a media database. It will be appreciated that while two computer systems and are shown in the web server system and the server computer system can be one computer system having different software components providing the web server functionality and the server functionality provided by the server computer system which will be described further below.

Client computer systems and can each with the appropriate web browsing software view HTML pages provided by the web server . The ISP provides Internet connectivity to the client computer system through the modem interface which can be considered part of the client computer system . The client computer system can be a personal computer system a network computer a Web TV system a handheld device or other such computer system. Similarly the ISP provides Internet connectivity for client systems and although as shown in the connections are not the same for these three computer systems. Client computer system is coupled through a modem interface while client computer systems and are part of a LAN. While shows the interfaces and as generically as a modem it will be appreciated that each of these interfaces can be an analog modem ISDN modem cable modem satellite transmission interface or other interfaces for coupling a computer system to other computer systems. Client computer systems and are coupled to a LAN through network interfaces and which can be Ethernet network or other network interfaces. The LAN is also coupled to a gateway computer system which can provide firewall and other Internet related services for the local area network. This gateway computer system is coupled to the ISP to provide Internet connectivity to the client computer systems and . The gateway computer system can be a conventional server computer system. Also the web server system can be a conventional server computer system.

Alternatively as well known a server computer system can be directly coupled to the LAN through a network interface to provide files and other services to the clients without the need to connect to the Internet through the gateway system . Furthermore any combination of client systems may be connected together in a peer to peer network using LAN Internet or a combination as a communications medium. Generally a peer to peer network distributes data across a network of multiple machines for storage and retrieval without the use of a central server or servers. Thus each peer network node may incorporate the functions of both the client and the server described above.

Network computers are another type of computer system that can be used with the embodiments of the present invention. Network computers do not usually include a hard disk or other mass storage and the executable programs are loaded from a network connection into the memory for execution by the processor . A Web TV system which is known in the art is also considered to be a computer system according to the embodiments of the present invention but it may lack some of the features shown in such as certain input or output devices. A typical computer system will usually include at least a processor memory and a bus coupling the memory to the processor.

It will be appreciated that the computer system is one example of many possible computer systems which have different architectures. For example personal computers based on an Intel microprocessor often have multiple buses one of which can be an input output I O bus for the peripherals and one that directly connects the processor and the memory often referred to as a memory bus . The buses are connected together through bridge components that perform any necessary translation due to differing bus protocols.

It will also be appreciated that the computer system is controlled by operating system software which includes a file management system such as a disk operating system which is part of the operating system software. One example of an operating system software with its associated file management system software is the family of operating systems known as Windows from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. and their associated file management systems. The file management system is typically stored in the non volatile storage and causes the processor to execute the various acts required by the operating system to input and output data and to store data in memory including storing files on the non volatile storage .

In the foregoing specification the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be evident that various modifications may be made thereto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims. The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative sense rather than a restrictive sense.
