The present invention is directed to one or more networked gaming systems each having a plurality of games available to the user.

Several categories of networked gaming systems are well known in the prior art. A networked gaming system may be a web based java application like Yahoo Games. Further a networked gaming system may be in the form of a downloadable software application that has a unique graphical user interface and may connect to the Internet via the back end of the software like for example the PartyPoker.com client application. Even further a networked gaming system may be in the form of a networked video game console wherein the several players in a game are connected to a network through their video came console i.e. Xbox . Other categories of networked gaming systems are apparent to those persons having ordinary skill in the art.

A user connected to a networked gaming system may choose to play one or more of the available games. In some networked gaming systems there may be over one hundred different available games making the selection of a specific game very cumbersome. The user may have already decided what game to play before connecting to the networked gaming system. If so the user will have to search through the plurality of available games to locate the particular game the user would like to play. This may become burdensome when there are a large number of games offered by the networked gaming system.

When the user finally locates the game the user would like to play there may be multiple variations of the specific game available for play. For example for the game of poker there may be multiple games Limit Hold em No Limit Hold em Pot Limit Hold em Omaha 7 Card Stud Razz multiple game styles cash game tournament sit and go freeroll and multiple game stakes 0.05 0.10 Limit through No Limit . For the game of poker there may be thousands of available variations available to the user of the networked gaming system.

Even once the user has located the game that the user would like to play and has further located the desired variation of that specific game the user may not be able to play because all available player positions or tables are full for that specific variation of the game. This is a very common concern for users who like to play popular games because any available position seat is filled almost instantly after it becomes vacant. This is a major concern for networked gaming system operators because users may become frustrated and decide not to play on that particular networked gaming system in the future. Having a waiting list is known to those having ordinary skill in the art but a waiting list is not effective because of its inherent deterrent effects. Having to wait for a game may cause a decrease in revenue for the networked gaming system or a reduction in the amount of money that the networked gaming system may earn through advertising.

Attempts have been made to alleviate some of the problems users face when trying to connect to a specific game of a networked gaming system. One downloadable poker client has a feature called QuickSeat that lets players bypass the lobby and choose which limit game type and stakes they would like to play. But the QuickSeat feature fails to adequately solve the problems associated with networked gaming systems having a plurality of games available to the user. First the QuickSeat feature only allows faster seating to Hold em poker tables and does not allow for faster seating to Omaha 7 Card Stud Razz or other games. Second the QuickSeat feature has only three fields by which the user may narrow the game selection process. Third the QuickSeat feature does not automatically buy in to the table i.e. take money out of the user s account and sit at the table with that money . Once a table has been found that meets the three search criteria the user still has to select how much money he would like to take to that table. Fourth the QuickSeat feature cannot save a user s preferences and automatically seat a player at a table that meets various user defined criteria. A player using the QuickSeat feature must re enter his search criteria each time the user logs in to the networked gaming system.

A networked gaming system wherein a game client application connects a player to at least one game server having at least one game table. The game server provides game operations and displays for transmission to the game client application and a display including at least one screen display designating a lobby from which a player can request to be seated at one or more of a plurality of virtual game positions in one of a plurality of multi player or single player games. The present invention may be incorporated into an overlay application with the game server providing game operations and displays for transmission to said overlay application. The displays include at least one lobby screen display accessible by the overlay application without a player having to login to the overlay application. Also a player may configure the networked gaming system so that when the user logs in the player is immediately taken to a game and bought in if necessary. An embodiment of the present invention is disclosed as an overlay messaging program incorporating the above features.

In one embodiment the invention is incorporated into the networked gaming system application such that when a user logs in to networked gaming system the user is immediately taken to his preferred game.

In another embodiment the present invention is incorporated into a separate overlay application on the user s PC independent of the networked gaming system application but closely connected with the networked gaming system s backend. Thus the overlay application may be distinct from the game client application. The overlay application may be capable of sending information to the game server or receiving information from the game server.

In yet another embodiment the present invention is incorporated into a messaging program on the user s PC independent of the networked gaming system application but closely connected with the networked gaming system s backend.

These and other features and advantages are evident from the following description of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.

The description herein describes an embodiment of the present invention namely where the invention is incorporated into an overlay application more specifically a messaging application that is closely connected to the networked gaming system s backend. In an alternate embodiment of the present invention the invention is incorporated into the networked gaming system directly. Persons having ordinary skill in the art recognize that the invention is not limited to those embodiments discussed herein.

There are several ways for a messaging application to become active. In one embodiment at Windows startup the messaging application starts in minimized mode loads into the system tray and tries to connect. This gives the messaging application less exposure but is more user friendly because the user does not always have to login manually. Also the messaging application can be opened manually. The user may click on any shortcut icon or directly on the .exe file and the messaging application loads into the system tray and maximizes. Wherein when any two of said game client applications are designated as client X and client Y when either client X or client Y is installed a corresponding lobby X or lobby Y may open from the overlay application when both clients X and Y are installed a lobby which was last open when the application was running the last time may be opened from the overlay application and when no client is installed a predetermined lobby may be opened from the overlay application. When no client is installed the predetermined lobby may be a news lobby or events lobby. Furthermore wherein at least one game client application is installed on a computer each game client application lobby and any games therein may be opened from each of the at least one game client applications.

Referring to while a messenger icon is present in the Windows system tray right clicking on the icon will open a navigation tree. The navigation tree may include the following choices QuickLinks Launch Favorites Settings Help System Info Version Connect Disconnect Snooze Log in out or Minimize Maximize.

The QuickLinks choice may be a list of links each of which opens in a new browser window. All areas should have different browser targets. The QuickLinks menu may contain links to areas such as My Account My Bonus Offers My Points Cashier Poker Casino Send This Program to a Friend Legal Info About Us or others that would be obvious to those having ordinary skill in the art. The Poker link may contain a subclass of links such as How To Play Poker School Poker Glossary News Events or Tournament Info Schedule. The Casino link may contain a subclass of links such as Games and Rules News Events or others.

The behavior of the Launch feature is in sync with a QuickLaunch bar of the messaging application as seen in . The Launch sub menu is a listing of all brand specific client applications that the user has already installed plus a Get More selection which opens another menu listing all brand specific client applications available and not installed on the user s computer. All installed client selections will launch the according client. In case the client is already open it will be the active window i.e. jumping into the front of the monitor. Clicking on a not installed client will start the download installation procedure for that specific client application.

The Favorites feature allows users to set up a favorite games list and have quick access to these games. This feature will be discussed in depth later.

The Settings feature opens up a separate window which lets the user manage all of his settings. An example of such a setting is Network Status. A network status window which may be integrated into the networked gaming system application may open up and follow the same behavior as the network status window on the networked gaming system application.

The Help feature allows the user to get help or support for the client applications or for the messenger. Also it may provide frequently asked questions FAQs that may help the user with problems.

The System Info feature may opens same information page as on the networked gaming system application connected to the messaging application.

The Version feature may open the same info as on the networked gaming system application connected to the messaging application.

The Connect Disconnect feature may facilitate re connecting if the connection is lost. If the user is disconnected a menu item Connect will be shown. By clicking on it the messaging application will try to connect to the Internet and the networked gaming system application. If the user is connected no selection will be shown. Referring to when the messaging application connects a small callout may popup from the messaging application icon indicating the connection. This callout may appear after the user manually connected to the web or the application established connection automatically. When the messaging application disconnects a callout may popup saying notifying the user of the disconnection. This callout may appear if the messaging application lost connection to the web. In case the user was also logged in the session will also be terminated and only the Disconnected callout will appear not the Logged out callout .

The Snooze feature may indicate if a user is idle. Referring to when the user snoozes the messaging application for X minutes or hours a snooze callout may popup saying Snoozing for X minutes. X will be the value selected by the user. The snooze callout may have the capability to countdown the hours and minutes. This would require including dynamic content into the snooze callout and incorporating a countdown which incorporates minutes and hours. Hitting the snooze option more then once will not add to the snoozing time. For example if the user selects one hour twice the messaging application will still only snooze for one hour. In case the user hits snooze for one hour and after ten minutes fifty min left hits snooze again the period of snoozing goes up to one hour again.

The Log in out feature facilitates logging in or out of the system. Referring to when the messaging application logs in a callout may popup indicating logging in. When the messaging application logs out a callout may popup indicating logging out. This callout will only appear if the user manually logs out or the connection to just the account backend is lost while other internet connections still work.

The messaging application can be maximized i.e. the window can be opened by double clicking on the messaging application icon in the system tray or right clicking on the messaging application icon when in minimized mode and selecting Maximize. When in maximized mode double clicking does not have any effect. If the messaging application is not the active window it will jump to the front of the desktop at double click.

The location of the maximized messaging application window may be a default location where the messaging application will be opened just above the system tray right aligned to the bottom right of the user s primary monitor. Anticipating the fact that the messaging application could place itself above another messenger application already in use the messaging application should be able to look out for other windows in the area Yahoo MSN AOL or Google messengers and place itself directly left of the already existing messenger. The user may drag the messaging application to any location on the visible screen. When the messaging application is minimized and later maximized the gaming messaging application will open at the same location. That location will be remembered by the messaging application so that in future if when user starts up the application it can be opened at that same location again. If the monitor resolution is decreased by user or other applications like the user of a projector the messaging application should support being replaced by Windows to suit the smaller resolution as all Windows applications do. This could involve resizing the window of the messaging application. If the monitor resolution increases the messaging application may stay at the same absolute coordinates as is and not resize.

Horizontal vertical resizing should be possible. Minimizing the window will only be possible down to a minimum width and height. If the messaging application is horizontally increased the HTML pages in the application dynamically extend as well. They may be built for a certain minimum width of the application however they also need to support a smooth user interface when the width of the application is increased.

Furthermore where one of the game client applications and associated game client application lobbies is designated as a poker client and lobby the poker lobby of the overlay messaging application may have substantially the same characteristics as the poker lobby of the client application with a different appearance. If the overlay application is maximized and the poker lobby is extended the poker lobby of the overlay application will refresh independently of a player being logged in or not snoozed or active with respect to the game client application.

Referring to the software interface of the messaging application may include a title bar several drop down menus a footer or QuickLaunch bar one or more sliders a log in section and other sections that would be obvious to persons having ordinary skill in the art.

The title bar may be a standard Windows title bar containing a logo for the application the application name a minimize button and a close button.

One or more drop down menus may be available. The user interface may follow the same standards as normal Windows programs. In one embodiment there may be three drop down menu in the drop down menu bar Messenger Favorites and Help Support .

Under the drop down menu Messenger may be the following sub menus My Account My Balance and Points Cashier Launch Settings Network Status Connect Disconnect Snooze On Off Log In Out Minimize Maximize or other sub menus that would be obvious to those having ordinary skill in the art.

The Launch sub menu behavior is in sync with the QuickLaunch bar or Footer section of the messaging application. This sub menu is a listing of all brand specific client applications that the user has installed already and a Get More selection which opens another menu listing all brand specific client applications available and not installed on the user s computer. All installed client selections will launch the according client. In case the client is already open it will be the active window i.e. jumping into the front of the monitor. Clicking on a not installed client will be starting the download installation procedure for that specific client application.

The Settings sub menu may open up a separate window that lets the user manage all his Settings. This single Settings sub menu may manage all messaging application settings. It may include the following areas. On off sections may be represented by checkboxes.

The Network Status sub menu may be integrated into all brand specific client applications. It follows the same behavior in the messaging application as in other brand specific client applications.

The Connect Disconnect sub menu may have two states Connect and Disconnect. Selecting this sub menu toggles between the Connect state and the Disconnect state. The current state may be represented with a checkmark in front of the sub menu listing.

The Snooze On Off sub menu may have two states Snooze On and Snooze Off. Selecting this sub menu toggles between the Snooze On state and the Snooze Off state. The current state may be represented with a checkmark in front of the sub menu listing.

The Log In Out sub menu may have two states Log In and Log Off. Selecting this sub menu toggles between the Log In state and the Log Off state. The current state may be represented with a checkmark in front of the sub menu listing.

The Minimize Maximize sub menu has only state one state Minimize. Choosing this sub menu will minimize the messaging application to the system tray.

The following is a list of possible sub menus and their actions under the Help Support drop down menu . Doubly indented menus are sub level menus or flyouts.

A standard preferences or Favorites drop down menu will be extended in data depth and functionality. Drop down Favorites may be vertical independent i.e. a user can have multiple favorites from various brand specific client applications. Drop down Favorites may be included on an account level meaning that a user may set personal favorites. For advanced systems the networked gaming system along with the messaging application may suggest Drop down Favorites to the user based on player game history.

The Drop down Favorites feature will cover three types of favorites category favorites direct favorites and AutoSeat favorites. Each of the three types requires different handling in functionality and representation messaging.

Category favorites are those of the type where a further selection by the user is still necessary before being able to access a game. When selecting a category the proper brand specific client application lobby may open up in the messaging program and the according sub category opened. For example if the user selects the category favorite Slots then the Casino lobby opens if not already open and the category slots expands.

Direct favorites are those of the type where a specific game can be directly accessed not simply a category of games and no additional refinement or action has to be done by the user. When clicking on a direct favorite the user will directly be sent to the according game. The buy in window opens and the user can buy in and sit down. All standard logic when accessing a table will be applied e.g. if insufficient funds then user will be prompted to go to cashier . For example if the user selects the direct favorite Poker Cash Games Cash Pot Limit Omaha 0.10 0.25 PL then the user will be automatically taken to a poker cash game pot limit Omaha where the blinds are 0.10 and 0.25. The user chooses the amount of his buy in and sits down and may begin playing.

The overlay application may include a selectable automated seating option or AutoSeat for automatically seating a player at one or more of a plurality of virtual game positions wherein a player is directly seated when the player logs in to the networked gaming system. A networked gaming system may include an automated seating option or AutoSeat feature of said mobile game client application capable of receiving and storing personal preference information including but not limited to a game category a specific game type stakes and an amount of money to be taken from a player s account when seating a player and for seating a player at a table in accordance with said stored personal preference information. AutoSeat favorites are those of the type where the user has selected the AutoSeat option and provided more information and is then automatically seated and bought in when the user chooses this option. For example if a user has the AutoSeat option selected on a No Limit Hold em table having blinds of 1 2 and a user buy in of 200 then once the user signs on he will automatically be taken to a No Limit Hold em table having blinds of 1 2 and the user will be bought in for 200 automatically. The goal of the AutoSeat functionality is to get users seated more quickly on a table.

The automated seating option of the game client application may be further selectable by the networked gaming system whereby personal gaming history including but not limited to a game category a specific game type stakes or an amount of money that a player commonly plays may be recorded by the networked gaming system and a player may be taken directly to a table upon logging into the system in accordance with the recorded personal gaming history of a player. Further based on the personal gaming history of a player some amount of money may be taken from a player s account when seating a player such that the player is seated with said amount of money usable for game play. Also the automated seating option may be manually selected by the user. Currently there are approximately nineteen steps required to open the gaming application and sit at the table with cash. The AutoSeat feature allows for seating at a table using only one step signing on.

Also a game client application may include a selectable automated seating option with the same operations as the automated seating option described above that is incorporated into an overlay application.

The main motivators for the AutoSeat feature are 1 to assist users in getting a table of their choice in a large dynamic and quickly moving data set of tables or games 2 make the seating process more convenient for user 3 use history and stored information to overcome ambiguous situations on the way to getting seated and 4 apply the service to a number of frontends interfaces from which the user might be accessing the networked gaming system.

The AutoSeat feature should be either backend or frontend driven. The best case is a mixture with backend storing the user s preferences and the frontend executing the query through the application programming interface.

Referring to naming conventions may be used to identify the favorites. The following are examples of naming conventions and structures that may be taken for poker and casino games 

The structure of the Favorites may be either in a one level list or as a multiple level subfolders flyout list. shows a favorites list limited to one level and no sub folders are included.

When opening the messaging application the favorites are read from the existing favorites of the user whether through clients or server to provide functionality to have seamless sharing of favorites between various brand specific clients and the messaging program. If no favorites exist the favorites folder may be empty.

Favorites may be added either in the messaging application directly or they may be added in each of the brand specific client applications those additions being automatically updated in the messaging application. If upon attempted addition of a Favorite it is discovered that it already exists as a favorite then the existing one may just be over written.

In the case of adding a Favorite especially an AutoSeat favorite upon choosing Add as Favorite a separate window may open up where the user may select more AutoSeat criteria. In order to ensure that the table seat that the AutoSeat feature selects is to the user s liking more search criteria may be selected in addition to simply selecting the game type and stakes. Some of the possible narrowing criteria may be Game group e.g. Cash Games Jackpot Tables Sit Go and Play for Free Game Type e.g. NL Holdem Limit Holdem . . . Stakes e.g. 5 10 10 20 . . . Seats at Table 2 6 10 Players at table e.g. Number X X or more X or less Waiting Waitlist OK Waitlist not OK Hands per hour e.g. Number X X or more X or less Average pot e.g. Number X X or more X or less or Buy in Min. buy in Normal buy in Full balance .

AutoSeat favorites automatically select a game table for the user open it up buy in and sit the player down. AutoSeat is a direct favorite with additional data and procedures to directly sit down on a table and buy in. The logic of table selection in the AutoSeat feature may be taken and modified from the existing Waitlist functionality. is a flowchart that shows an embodiment of the about nineteen steps it takes a user to sit at a game table to play. First the user begins in a lobby . From there the user selects the game group . The game group query is narrowed by various filters . Alternatively if the user would like to play at a table with a buddy from a buddy list the user may search for buddy . The next step is to enter the table . Then the user sits the player down at the table. Finally a user may begin playing . The approximately nineteen steps may include 1. Select game group e.g. Cash games 2. Select game type e.g. Limit Holdem 3. Select stakes e.g. 5 10 4. Select filter to limit choice of tables 5. Sort table list by specific column 6. Scroll table list 7. Find free table 8. Highlight table 9. Select table 10. Open table 11. Check of logged in 12. Check if seat free 13. Check if enough money points for buy in . Time out for sitting down 15. Check blinds at table 16. Geographic preference to sit 17. How much money to take to table 18. One or more players at table and . Wait for blinds. In contrast to the nineteen step process described herein and depicted in the AutoSeat feature allows for seating at a table using only one step signing on.

Referring to after choosing a Direct or AutoSeat Favorite the process of seating a player follows the sequence Connected Tables available Free tables available Buy in Sit Down .

If the system or Internet connection is down then the standard error popup will be displayed in case a user loses connection.

If currently no tables are available in the selected game type stake combination e.g. No Limit Hold em 5 10 a popup will come up telling the user There are currently no tables available in GAME TYPE STAKE . Please try other GAME TYPE tables. When clicking on the OK button the popup closes and the user will be taken to the GAME TYPE category which includes tables from all stakes. GAME TYPE STAKE combinations are applicable for live games and Sit Go s which use Buy ins .

If currently no tables are available in the selected game group e.g. Cash Games a popup will come up telling the user There are currently no tables available in GAME GROUP 1 . Please try GAME GROUP 2 . with GAME GROUP 1 being the game group he is looking for and GAME GROUP 2 being the other available game group game groups are Cash and Play . When clicking on the OK button the popup closes. The user will stay in his current lobby selection.

Refining criteria can be used to filter for a table of choice. Independent of the game type or stake these filters may have special behaviors if no table is found with the exact criteria.

For the refiner Average Pot Size the criteria may be X or more or X or less. If the selected average pot restriction does not retrieve any tables but tables with other values are available a popup may come up saying We did not find any tables with avg. pot SELECTED VALUE or SELECTED CONDITION LESS OR MORE . However we found similar tables with different avg. pot values. Please repeat your search again after a few seconds or take a look at the other tables we found. Clicking on Try again may trigger another lookup for the exact criteria again. View other tables will just open the according game types lobby and let the user manually go through the tables.

A refiner for Sit and Go tournaments is the buy in amount. If the selected buy in value does not retrieve any tables but tables with other values are available a popup will come up saying We did not find any tables with a BUY IN buy in however we found similar tables with different buy ins. Please repeat your search again after a few seconds or take a look at the other tables we found. Clicking on Try again may trigger another lookup for the exact criteria again. View other tables will just open the according game types lobby and let the user manually go through the tables.

For the refiner Hands per hour the criteria may be Number X X or more or X or less. If the selected hands per hour restriction does not retrieve any tables but tables with other values are available a popup will come up saying We did not find any tables with avg. pot SELECTED VALUE or SELECTED CONDITION LESS OR MORE . However we found similar tables with different hands per hour values. Please repeat your search again after a few seconds or take a look at the other tables we found. Clicking on Try again will trigger another lookup for the exact criteria again. View other tables will just open the according game types lobby and let the user manually go through the tables.

Similar messages to those above may pop up if other search criteria is not met but similar tables are available. Also if the user uses a combination of criteria for auto seating and does not get any tables the system may loosen the above criteria one by one in a pre defined order and check again for availability.

A differentiation in handling a search for free tables will be required for users which are willing to be put on a wait list and users who do not. This preference may be set when adding changing a Favorite. The following table Table 1 lists possible scenarios based on the assumption that the system does not find any free table based on the selections done. As mentioned above STAKE can be understood as stake blinds or buy in depending on game type.

For combinations of above criteria if the user uses a combination of criteria for auto seating and does not get any free tables the system may loosen the above criteria one by one in a pre determined order and check again for availability.

If a free table fitting the exact filter of a user is found the user will be taken to the table. If more then one table fitting the exact filter of a user is found then a random selection may be used to pick the table. After above selection criteria have been run through and a table been found the table will be directly opened. Even if issues arise during sitting down the table should be open to give the user more incentive to proceed towards taking a seat. An immediate check of proper login information or sufficient balance could be done when the user triggers the direct or AutoSeat Favorite but is not chosen as it is deemed to be more important to open the table and with this give the user a graphic incentive to proceed until he sites down.

To buy in for Direct Favorites the user will take over to sit down i.e. buy in manually . For the AutoSeat feature the following seat taking procedure will be triggered.

Step 1 Logged in If the user is not logged in yet he will get the login dialogue for login. After successful login the user will automatically get seated. In case the user has either Auto Login activated and or Remember me the login will be done automatically by the system so the user does not have to.

Step 2 Play Money vs. Real Money user. If the system detects a Play Money user trying to log into a Real Money game the standard handling is being triggered of a popup being displayed to the user.

Step 3 Buy in. There may be three or more different buy in criteria including Minimum buy in Normal buy in Full balance or Fixed Buy in Tournament. If the user does not have enough money in his account to meet the minimum buy in criteria an error message will be triggered as seen in .

After that popup the buy in window will open and the user would be required to go to the Cashier and increase his balance. In case the user selected the Minimum Buy In option and he has the according amount in his account he will get seated properly the minimum buy in deducted from his balance and added to the table and the user may start playing.

For the Normal buy in full balance option if the user does not have the specified buy in amount but at least the minimum buy in a popup will appear with the message You have USER S BALANCE in your account. Please specify how much you want to take to the table. When clicking on OK the user may be taken to the buy in dialogue where he may specify his buy in. After that popup the buy in window will open and the user would be required to go to the Cashier and increase his balance.

For the Fixed buy in tournaments option in the user will be seated if he has sufficient funds in his account. In case he does not a popup may appear You do not have sufficient funds in your account. Please come back with the appropriate number of chips. When clicking on OK the user will get directed to the buy in dialogue where he can go to the cashier.

To sit down the user may have selected a refiner Players per seats which may refine the search based on the number of seated players at a given table taken as a ratio of the total number of seats at the table. Possible criteria for this refiner are Ratio X X or more or X or less. 

With tournaments especially Sit and Go tournaments a concern is that even if a table is listed as available in the time it takes a user to double click on the table listing and buy in the table has already been filled because of the large number of players trying to access that type of game. This may happen multiple times in succession and the user may become frustrated and decide to refrain from playing. The AutoSeat feature will help remedy this problem.

If the Status of a tournament has changed from Registering to any other status e.g. Level 1 or first level of play the system should automatically look after a new Tournament table. To avoid the user losing his seat while the system is seating him the seat should be reserved by the system at the point the free seat is found. Once all five of the above steps have been completed the user will be seated and can start to play.

Referring to a user can add change the position of or remove a favorite in a Favorites Manager interface. The feature can be accessed through the Favorites drop down . When clicking on the according option a dialogue opens up that lets the user arrange his Favorites and remove them . The user can save and close or discard his changes. Referring to when the user clicks on Add Favorites the current section will be added as Favorite in the messaging application. A Favorites Manager may appear to allow the user to select refining search criteria in the case of Direct or AutoSeat favorites. This allows a user to change preferences of each favorite remove favorites or rank favorites .

Referring to below the Drop Down Menus there may be a section for logging into and managing a user s account. The Login Section or My Account section will have the same behavior and style as the My Account sections in the brand specific client applications. In case of a loss of connection the user may be logged out and the My Account section automatically reloads back to the blank login screen. If the messaging application is in active or snooze mode this does not have any effect on the My Account section . One feature Auto login will give the user the ability to automatically log into the messaging application when opening it up. This can be especially useful for heavy users which want to auto start and auto connect to the messaging application at computer startup. The feature can also be disabled in the settings.

Referring to and the various brand specific client applications can be accessed via sliders that are accessible through the messaging application. Clicking on a slider will expand the section with other sections minimizing. The sliders will have the same behavior as in the brand specific client applications. Right clicking on any slider may give the user a menu to add and remove sliders into the messaging application window.

The lobbies of the brand specific client applications may be accessible through the sliders without the user having to login. The lobbies may be accessible independent of whether the client is installed however if a client is installed the according lobby will open per default. If a given game client application is installed the associated game client application lobby may be opened from the overlay application messaging application . The overlay application lobby provides the same game choices as the at least one game client application lobby.

Referring to the Poker lobby slider has the same characteristics as a brand specific client poker lobby with the difference of the dimensions. The same error case handling can be applied as well. If the messaging application is maximized and the poker lobby slider is extended the lobby will refresh. This will happen independent of whether the user is logged in out snoozed or active. In any other case maximized messaging application but poker lobby section not extended messaging application window minimized refresh does not take place. For easier access to the tables of choice in the limited dimensions of the messaging application filters along the poker tree navigation levels are used. The top level filter may contain broad categories such as Cash Games Jackpot Tables Sit Go Tournaments Tournament Events or Play for Free. Second level navigation items match the secondary navigation in the brand specific client poker lobby e.g. the Cash Games top level section may include Hold em Omaha Stud and other games. The third level may contain the stakes as a refiner e.g. All 5 10 10 20 etc.

When changing the filters the selection change is requested immediately a submit command e.g. clicking on submit button or hitting return is not required. Order of filtering is from first to third level descending i.e. the top level selection influences the second level which influences the third level which influences any other levels there may be. If the user changes the top level navigation both second level navigation items and third level will change. Initial selection in the Poker lobby may be Cash Games Limit Hold em 100 200.

Vertical and horizontal scroll bars will enable the user to quickly scroll up and down the table list and also right in case his window is not wide enough to display all columns. Default position of the list window will be top left of the list. The scroll bar will have the same functionality as other standard scrollbars. In case the table list is shorter then the window the scroll bar vanishes.

To live games not tournaments the fields Table Stks Stakes Plrs Sts Players Seat Wtg Waiting H hr Hand hour and AvgPot Average Pot not shown may be displayed in the table list. Full tables may be displayed in a different color preferably grey. There may be a full table filter a button will let the user hide or show full tables. By default the button may be pressed and say Show full tables. In this case full tables are being hidden. If the user depresses the button it will say Hide full tables. Full tables are now being shown. In general all of the same filters as available in the main client should also be possible in the messenger.

If there are no results available in the table list the table list will be empty just showing one entry messaging No tables available. Use the filters to find other games or check back at a later point. If tables exist but are not being shown due to an active full table filter the full table filter button deactivates and the tables will be shown even if full. The button setting is remembered and as soon as the user changes the selection the button jumps back to its settings. All fields columns can sort the table list the same way as currently a poker client lobby does. Sorting will be ascending descending fashion following the same behavior a poker client lobby has.

Referring to by left clicking on a table the table will be highlighted. Double clicking on a table it will open. You can also open through the open button below the table list as seen in . An Open button lets users enter a game after highlighting it. If a user highlighted a table which he is already sitting at the Open button will de activate.

In case he is already on the waitlist the button will be inactive and a small icon will be messaging the fact and he will have the option to unjoin. Referring to the Auto Seat button will save the user from manual selecting and immediately sit him on a free table. The Auto Seat feature will follow the selection process of the Waitlist option.

Navigation selection and access to the table happens in the messaging application lobby. From there the table picks up the process. This implies the fact that a poker table does not need a poker client open to play. After the user double clicked or opened a table the table opens up so the user can watch the table. If the user wants to take a seat buy in and any other features are being taken over by the existing table functionality. As is the present case at this point the blocked country list will be enforced.

Referring to for tournament poker tables the fields ID Date Name Game Buy In and Plr Player will be displayed in the table list. Tournaments which are not accessible anymore to the user may display in grey color. A tournament may also be listed with a grey color if it is either a full tournament or a tournament that has already started and does not offer a late buy in.

A Register button lets the users register for a tournament after highlighting it. If a user highlighted a tourney which he is already registered for the Register button will de activate and a small icon checkmark icon will be messaging the fact in the table list.

Registration will happen after the same process as currently. There may be a Reminder button which triggers the Tournament Reminder feature. The Tournament Reminder is a built in alert count down which does not need any online connection. To anticipate scheduled changes however it monitors the tournament it is attached to and changes reminder times and alerts if the tournament start time changes. This feature may be used in pre login stage. Only when reserving or going to the tournament lobby the user will be required to log in.

Referring to the Casino lobby slider is accessible without the user having to login. For easier access to the games of choice in the limited dimensions of the messenger application filters along the current casino navigation are used. The top level navigation may contain such general categories of games as Slots Roulette Video Poker Blackjack Caribbean Stud Let It Ride etc. The second level navigation may contain the actual games e.g. Sweet Hawaii Cash Cruise Super Fortune Wheel etc. When changing the filters the selection change is requested immediately a submit button is not required. The Default filter values are always the first selection in case the user never changed the selection before. If the user changed a selection before the default value will be the previous selection when the user comes back to that drop down.

If the user gets disconnected navigating the lobby will be unaffected. If he tries to access a game a popup will appear We are sorry but cannot open the table as the Messenger currently is not connected. When clicking on OK the user will get back to the lobby. If disconnected the messaging application will keep trying in the background every 30 seconds to connect again.

If more games are in a category than space allowed in the lobby a vertical scroll bar will enable the user to quickly scroll up and down the lobby. The scroll bar will have the same functionality as other standard scrollbars. In case the table list is shorter then the window the scroll bar deactivates.

Clicking once on a game makes that table highlighted. Double clicking on a game will open it. While this may not be consistent with the client casino application this is done to be consistent with the navigation behavior in the poker lobby of the messenger. You can also open through the open button below the table list.

Right mouse clicking on a game will bring up a context menu where the user may open the game and will see the info on the game. Info on the game will be the same as in the Casino Lobby of the client. Clicking on the Open button the user will enter the game. In case he is already on the game another instance of the game will open.

Navigation selection and access to the games happens in the messenger application lobby. From there the game functionality picks up. If the user wants to buy in play or use any other features are being taken over by the existing game window functionality. This implies the fact that casino games do not need a Casino client open to play.

Other lobbies as would be obvious to persons having ordinary skill in the art may also be accessed through the messenger application. For example a Backgammon lobby slider a racing lobby slider or a skill game chess checkers etc. lobby slider. Referring to the sliders may me managed by right clicking on any slider and choosing the sliders that the user would like visible.

Referring to at the bottom of the messenger application there may be a QuickLaunch bar that will behave similar to a QuickLaunch bar in the client application. The QuickLaunch bar may contain an icon for each installed vertical client a Get More selection and a cashier button . If more icons are included than the width of the unit can accommodate a new line may be opened. If the user clicks on the Cashier button he will directly go to the cashier portion of the client application. Icons are automatically placed into the messenger QuickLaunch bar when a new client is installed or offered by the brand specific client applications. This enables the user to install open or switch between clients.

Not installed icons may be greyed out. Installed icons may be colored. If the user clicks on an icon which is not installed yet he will get a dialogue asking him Do you want to download and install the X client Two buttons Yes and No let him proceed or cancel. If the user clicks on an icon of a client which is not started yet but is installed then the client opens. If the client is already open it just jumps to the foreground. If the user is already signed in on one client the other clients if started or not automatically sign in as well.

Referring to the Get More selection triggers a menu of other games currently offered by the brand specific client but not installed yet. If new vertical clients become available the menu automatically updates and the Get More selection changes color in the footer and blinks. When selecting one of the vertical clients the user goes to the vertical s website for a standard installation process configurable if the user could directly trigger a download installer .

Referring to the News Events slider may have the same behavior as currently on a client. This includes scrolling base HTML and maximum number of messages. This number can be changed independent of the main clients. As the messenger application dimensions can be horizontally and vertically increased in size the base HTML format and style and the scrolling rules have to be reworked to accompany for this. The messenger application will combine messages from specific brands Poker Casino Backgammon etc. and also from independent sources.

News which may be in the form of scrolling text or popup items needs to get fed to the messenger application in real time i.e. whenever a message to one or many users is being scheduled and then pushed by the client to the game servers it needs to be pushed or pulled by the application itself to the messenger. The inclusion process of a message into the messenger application is important for the success of users receiving messages from the clients.

Information may be sent between the overlay application and the game server. This information may be a promotional message from the game server to users of the overlay application. A new channel will be added into a Client Messaging Tool PAM tool to enable a marketing department to address the client applications only messenger application only or both. A user will be shown messages pertaining to the messenger application itself and pertaining to clients the user has installed. For example if a user has Poker and Casino installed he will see all messages scheduled to Poker users and all scheduled to Casino users. As some messages are scheduled on two or more clients the PAM tool needs to remove redundant messages so that users do not see the same twice. This can be caught due to the PAM tool enabling marketing to schedule one message to all verticals at the same time but also needs to be handled in case messages are being scheduled separately which can be done through the introduction of a pattern matching in the Messenger.

Prioritizing messages in the messenger will be done based on the existing prioritization scheme developed in the PAM which will be applied to all brands in case of a user having multiple clients installed. This means that in case of two Poker and Casino messages being scheduled in the same priority level they will be listed with the message higher who was scheduled later.

Changes in the PAM to Search Current Messages and Add Edit interface are to be done in the PAM tool. Referring to a PAM tool is shown. A message ID field allows the PAM tool user to select a predefined message to send to the clients. A message filed allows the PAM tool user to create their own new message. A brand column allows the PAM tool user to select which client applications will receive the message. A recipients field may allow the PAM tool user to change which clients get the message. Other fields may be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art.

Selecting any brand in the brand column will add a message to the client AND the messenger. The messenger will receive the message if the user has the according client installed the user has the according section enabled as slider in his Messenger see above for including excluding sections in the messenger . For example if the user does not have Poker client installed but has the Poker Lobby slider in his Messenger. All messages scheduled to Poker will also be included in the Messenger.

Referring to a desktop alert is a real time alert on the user s desktop triggered by the messenger. Messages will be delivered real time to the user which will extend the scope from scheduled messages to transactional driven actions. To reach that a push model will be used i.e. whenever there is a message for the user available it will be pushed by the system to the clients. Most messages can be delivered to the user s desktop. These messages can be triggered by the PAM tool see above or other delivery mechanisms. Some examples are Bonus offers Money added to user s account News and Promotions Reminders Transactional Messages password changed Player s Club signup etc. Promotional Message promotions etc. or others.

The following table Table 2 lists some of the possible message types where the message is originated from and a short description of the message.

Messages pushed may adhere to above described prioritization system to handle any possible unanticipated message conflicts. Access controls will exist on system side to define the types of messages which will go out to the user s desktop see separate PAM spec .

A message may be delivered to the desktop either a in real time i.e. while the messenger is online and active b at start of the messenger if messages have been scheduled for the user while he was offline c at login to the messenger if personal messages have been scheduled for the user while he was not logged in during this period only anonymous messages could be sent to him or d after snoozing timed out or was manually disabled by the user.

The messages may appear just above the messenger icon in the system tray aligned to the bottom right of the desktop. If other applications use the same space for messages it still will be taken even if there is a small likelihood of two messages popping up at the same time from two different applications. A short alert sound may be triggered when an Alert pops up.

The user can click on the message anytime when viewable on the monitor i.e. when fully displayed or already fading out. When the user clicks on the message the full message at the linked destination pops up. This could be a new browser window opening the specific message in the Message Center in his My Account on partyaccount.com a news or promotion page on partypoker.com or any other website in case of a Bonus Offer the Party wallet window triggered from the PMsgr or the same information on partyaccount.com or in case of Money added to your account the PMsgr getting to the front of the monitor and the My Account section expanding. Further functionality will be handled by the triggered pages or messages.

Further the information sent between an overlay application and the game server may be in the form of a chat or instant message between two or more users of the overlay application. The messaging application may be configured in such a way as to allow users to create and manage personalized buddy lists of other users or friends. This may be similar to well known instant messaging software available i.e AOL Instant Messenger Yahoo Messenger . Users will be able to select a user from their buddy list or a user not in their buddy list and send a unique personal message to the other user. A user may organize his buddy list using categories such as Friends Fish users who are not skilled in the game of poker Good Players etc.

Users may also be able to set personal alerts. For example a user may set an alert that notifies the user visually or with a sound that a specific other user has logged onto the networked gaming system.

A user may be able to see which games another user is playing by selecting that other user in his buddy list. Further a user may invite another user in his buddy list to join him at a specific game. These and other features and benefits of an instant messaging program may be incorporated as would be obvious to persons having ordinary skill in the art.

While the foregoing written description of the invention enables one of ordinary skill to make and use what is considered presently to be the best mode thereof those of ordinary skill will understand and appreciate the existence of variations combinations and equivalents of the specific exemplary embodiment and method herein. The invention should therefore not be limited by the above described embodiment and method but by all embodiments and methods within the scope and spirit of the invention as claimed.
