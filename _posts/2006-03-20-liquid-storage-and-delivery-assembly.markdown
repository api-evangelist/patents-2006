title: Liquid storage and delivery assembly
abstract: A water storage and delivery assembly includes stackable compartments, each compartment having a planar bottom wall, opposed side walls, and opposed end walls, forming a reservoir. Frusto-conically shaped conduits having open large first ends are fixed to peripheries of openings in the bottom walls, and open smaller second ends are disposed below upper edges of the side and end walls. The assembly further includes a bottom-most compartment of the same construction but having no openings in the bottom wall thereof. Water poured into a first conduit is flowable through a plurality of first conduits to the bottom-most compartment while air escapes upwardly through a series of second conduits, the water rising until all the compartments of the assembly are filled. Each compartment is provided with an outlet operable to permit the water to travel from a compartment to an exothermic mass.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

The invention relates to assemblies for storing liquids such as water in a plurality of segregated compartments and for discharging the liquid from the compartments as needed for activation of masses of liquid activated material. More specifically the assembly is adapted to store water for delivery to exothermic masses such as magnesium iron powder for the generation of heat.

Water activated warming devices are known in the art the devices providing an exothermic reaction over a period of time for purposes such as warming the body of a user. In one known embodiment water is added to magnesium iron powder to initiate a rapid exothermic reaction which produces heat along with magnesium hydroxide and gaseous hydrogen.

Typically the exothermic material used is disposed in segmented chambers in stacked arrangement each having therein a material which reacts exothermically with water. The segmentation facilitates controlled useful heat production over an extended period of time.

However the water supply is usually concentrated in one area. Various delivery systems have been developed to distribute the water in proper quantities to each of the stacked segmented chambers holding the exothermic material.

There is a need for a water storage and delivery system which is relatively simple in construction and easily transportable and operable to activate a stack of exothermic chambers either serially or simultaneously by delivering the correct amount of water to each chamber.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide a water or other liquid storage and delivery assembly including a plurality of stacked compartments each holding and able to selectively deliver to an associated exothermic chamber a correct amount of water to energize the material therein.

With the above and other objects in view a feature of the present invention is the provision of a liquid storage and delivery assembly including at least two stackable compartments each being provided with a planar bottom wall opposed side walls opposed end walls and in all but the topmost compartment a planar top wall forming the compartment for retaining liquid. At least two frusto conically shaped conduits are mounted on the bottom walls of the compartments the larger ends of the conduits being fixed to the bottom wall and the smaller ends of the conduits being disposed in a plane removed from the plane of the top of the compartment. The bottom wall of a lowermost one of the compartments is closed and the bottom walls of upper ones of the compartments are provided with openings therein in communication with the larger ends of the conduits mounted in the upper compartments. The top walls of compartments beneath the uppermost compartment are provided with orifices aligned with the smaller ends of conduits immediately therebeneath. Liquid admitted to the uppermost compartment by way of the smaller end of a first conduit therein is flowable through the first conduit of the uppermost compartment and thence to and through lower compartments to overflow the first conduit of the lowermost compartment to fill the lowermost compartment air escaping from the lowermost compartment through the second conduits. The compartments are filled progressively upward until the uppermost compartment is filled. Each of the compartments is provided with an outlet operable to permit liquid to flow from each of the compartments simultaneously or serially.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that an illustrative compartment includes a planar bottom wall opposed side walls opposed end walls and a substantially planar top wall .

First and second frusto conically shaped conduits are fixed at their larger openings to the bottom wall and are provided with smaller openings disposed in a plane slightly removed from the plane of the side wall and end wall upper edges.

Each compartment is provided with an outlet disposed in a wall of the compartment proximate the bottom wall of the compartment. The outlet may be an opening covered with an adhesive strip or the like.

The top wall is provided with apertures aligned with the conduit smaller openings and centrally of the conduit larger openings . The top wall preferably is provided with grooves or ridges on upper and or lower surfaces thereof to facilitate mounting on the compartment wall upper edges and for receiving the bottom wall of a further compartment stacked thereon.

In use the compartments are stacked such that the lowermost compartment is provided with the bottom wall devoid of openings and a top wall having the apertures therein aligned respectively with the conduit smaller openings disposed in the lowermost compartment

An upper compartment rests upon the lowermost compartment bottom edges of the upper compartment resting in or snapping into the grooves and or ridges on the top wall of the lowermost compartment

An uppermost compartment stacks upon the compartment s therebelow one compartment in and three compartments and in and is not provided with a top wall.

In operation a stack of four compartments is generally used in cooperation with a stack of four exothermic chambers not shown .

To prime the compartments the uppermost compartment is open topped exposing the interior of the compartment and the smaller conduit openings therein. Liquid is poured into the first of the openings. The liquid flows through the opening the conduit the larger opening the orifice in the next lower compartment top wall and through the conduits thereunder until the liquid reaches the bottom wall inside the larger end of the lowermost first conduit whereupon the liquid fills the lowermost first conduit and overflows the smaller opening thereof to start filling the lowermost compartment while air displaced by the liquid escapes by way of the second conduit .

The liquid in due course fills the lowermost compartment including the interior of both conduits and begins to fill the next higher disposed container and so on until all the containers in the stack are filled.

The stack may be placed adjacent a similar stack of chambers housing magnesium iron powder or other exothermic material. The outlets may be opened essentially simultaneously to activate four exothermic cells or serially to activate one cell at a time.

There is thus provided a liquid storage and delivery system adapted to selectively deliver to associated exothermic chambers correct amounts of liquid to energize materials therein.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
