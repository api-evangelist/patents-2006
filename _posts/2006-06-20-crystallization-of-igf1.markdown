title: Crystallization of IGF-1
abstract: Crystalline IGF-1 is provided along with a method for production thereof. Crystallizing IGF-1 comprises the steps of mixing an aqueous solution comprising IGF-1 with a reservoir solution comprising a precipitant to form a mixture; and crystallizing the mixture, optionally also recrystallizing and isolating the crystalline IGF-1. In addition, a method for identifying IGF-1 indirect agonists is provided using a detergent as a standard for the level of inhibition of binding of IGFBP-1 or IGFBP-3 to IGF-1 and/or using the coordinates of the binding pockets of IGF-1 to which a candidate indirect agonist binds for structure-based drug design.

This is a divisional application claiming the benefit of the priority of i U.S. non provisional application No. 10 066 009 filed on Feb. 1 2002 which has matured into U.S. Pat. No. 7 084 240 ii U.S. provisional application No. 60 267 977 filed Feb. 9 2001 and iii U.S. provisional application No. 60 287 072 filed Apr. 27 2001 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention is directed to a crystalline form of human insulin like growth factor 1 IGF 1 and more particularly to a crystal of human IGF 1 a method of crystallization thereof and its structure obtained by x ray diffraction. In addition the invention relates to methods of identifying new IGF 1 agonist molecules based on biophysical and biochemical data suggesting that a single detergent molecule that contacts residues known to be important for IGF 1 binding protein IGFBP interactions binds to IGF 1 specifically and blocks binding of IGFBP 1 and IGFBP 3.

There is a large body of literature on the actions and activities of IGFs IGF 1 IGF 2 and IGF variants . Human IGF 1 is a serum protein of 70 amino acids and 7649 daltons with a p1 of 8.4 Rinderknecht and Humbel 73 4379 4381 1976 Rinderknecht and Humbel 253 2769 1978 belonging to a family of somatomedins with insulin like and mitogenic biological activities that modulate the action of growth hormone GH Van Wyk et al. 30 259 1974 Binoux 41 157 1980 Clemmons and Van Wyk 57 161 1981 Baxter 25 49 1986 U.S. Pat. No. 4 988 675 WO 91 03253 WO 93 23071 . IGFs share a high sequence identity with insulin being about 49 identical thereto. Unlike insulin however which is synthesized as a precursor protein containing a 33 amino acid segment known as the C peptide which is excised to yield a covalently linked dimer of the remaining A and B chains IGFs are single polypeptides see .

In the developing embryo the absence of IGF 1 leads to severe growth retardation that continues post natally Baker et al. 75 73 82 1993 Powell Braxton et al. 7 2609 2617 1993 Liu et al. 75 59 72 1993 Liu et al. 12 1452 1462 1998 . While most greater than 75 of serum IGF 1 is produced by the liver in response to growth hormone this liver derived IGF 1 has been shown to be unnecessary for post natal body growth in mice Sjogren et al. 96 7088 7092 1999 . Rather it is the locally produced non hepatic IGF 1 acting in a paracrine autocrine manner which appears to be responsible for most of the post natal growth promoting effects of IGF 1 Schlechter et al. 83 7932 7934 1986 Isaksson et al. 216 1237 1239 1982 . Consistent with its growth promoting effects IGF 1 is a powerful mitogen regulating diverse cellular functions such as cell cycle progression apoptosis and cellular differentiation reviewed in Jones and Clemmons 16 3 34 1995 and in LeRoith 141 1287 1288 2000 .

IGFs have been implicated in a variety of cellular functions and disease processes including cell cycle progression proliferation differentiation and insulin like effects in insulin resistant diabetes. Thus IGF has been suggested as a therapeutic tool in a variety of diseases and injuries. Due to this range of activities IGF 1 has been tested in mammals for such widely disparate uses as wound healing treatment of kidney disorders treatment of diabetes reversal of whole body catabolic states such as AIDS related wasting treatment of heart conditions such as congestive heart failure and treatment of neurological disorders Guler et al. 85 4889 4893 1988 Schalch et al. 77 1563 1568 1993 Froesch et al. 42 66 71 1994 Vlachopapadopoulou et al. 12 3715 3723 1995 Saad et al. 37 Abstract 40 1994 Schoenle et al. 34 675 679 1991 Morrow et al.

The patent literature also abounds with disclosures of various uses of IGF 1 or compounds that increase active concentration of IGF 1 to treat mammals especially human patients for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 714 460 5 273 961 5 466 670 5 126 324 5 187 151 5 202 119 5 374 620 5 106 832 4 988 675 5 106 832 5 068 224 5 093 317 5 569 648 and 4 876 242 WO 92 11865 WO 96 01124 WO 91 03253 WO 93 25219 WO 93 08826 and WO 94 16722.

The IGF system is also composed of membrane bound receptors for IGF 1 IGF 2 and insulin. The Type 1 IGF receptor IGF 1R is closely related to the insulin receptor in structure and shares some of its signaling pathways Jones and Clemmons supra . The IGF 2 receptor is a clearance receptor that appears not to transmit an intracellular signal Jones and Clemmons supra . Since IGF 1 and IGF 2 bind to IGF 1R with a much higher affinity than to the insulin receptor Cascieri et al. 27 3229 3233 1988 it is most likely that most of the effects of IGF 1 and IGF 2 are mediated by IGF 1R Humbel 190 445 462 1990 Ballard et al. Does IGF 1 ever act through the insulin receptor in Baxter et al. Eds. Amsterdam Elsevier 1994 pp. 131 138 .

IGF 1R is an 2 2 heterotetramer of disulfide linked and subunits. dimers are themselves disulfide linked on the cell surface to form a covalent heterotetramer. As in the insulin insulin receptor complex IGF 1 binds to the IGF 1R with a 1 2 stoichiometry De Meyts 37 S135 S148 1994 with a high affinity site Kabout 0.4 nM and a low affinity site Kabout 6 nM Tollefsen and Thompson 263 16267 16273 1988 . The x ray crystal structure of the first three domains of IGF 1R has been determined Garrett et al. 394 395 399 1998 . It contains three distinct domains L1 Cys rich L2 . Mutations that affect IGF 1 binding map to the concave surface of the receptor.

IGF 1R is a key factor in normal cell growth and development Isaksson et al. 8 426 438 1987 Daughaday and Rotwein 10 68 91 1989 . Increasing evidence suggests however that IGF 1R signaling also plays a critical role in growth of tumor cells cell transformation and tumorigenesis Baserga 55 249 252 1995 . Key examples include loss of metastatic phenotype of murine carcinoma cells by treatment with antisense RNA to the IGF 1R Long et al. 55 1006 1009 1995 and the in vitro inhibition of human melanoma cell motility Stracke et al. 264 21544 21549 1989 and of human breast cancer cell growth by the addition of IGF 1R antibodies Rohlik et al. 149 276 281 1987 .

The IGFs are potent breast cancer cell mitogens based on the observation that IGF 1 enhanced breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro Cullen et al. 50 48 53 1990 . Breast cancers express IGF 2 and IGF 1R providing all the required effectors for an autocrine loop based proliferation paradigm Quinn et al. 271 11477 11483 1996 Steller et al. 56 1761 1765 1996 . Because breast cancer is a common malignancy affecting approximately one in every eight women and is a leading cause of death from cancer in North American women LeRoith et al. 122 54 59 1995 new rational therapies are required for intervention. IGF 1 can suppress apoptosis and therefore cells lacking IGF 1Rs or having compromised IGF 1R signaling pathways may give rise to tumor cells that selectively die via apoptosis Long et al. 55 1006 1009 1995 . Furthermore it has recently become evident that alterations in IGF signaling in the context of other disease states such as diabetes may be responsible for exacerbating the complications of retinopathy Smith et al. 276 1706 1709 1997 and nephropathy Horney et al. 274 F1045 F1053 1998 .

IGF 1 in vivo is mostly found in complex with a family of at least six serum proteins known as IGFBPs Jones and Clemmons supra Bach and Rechler 3 38 61 1995 that modulate access of the IGFs to the IGF 1R. They also regulate the concentrations of IGF 1 and IGF 2 in the circulation and at the level of the tissue IGF 1R Clemmons et al. 692 10 21 1993 . The IGFBPs bind IGF 1 and IGF 2 with varying affinities and specificities Jones and Clemmons supra Bach and Rechler supra . For example IGFBP 3 binds IGF 1 and IGF 2 with a similar affinity whereas IGFBP 2 and IGFBP 6 bind IGF 2 with a much higher affinity than they bind IGF 1 Bach and Rechler supra Oh et al. 132 1337 1344 1993 . The major carrier protein is IGFBP 3. Nothing is currently known about the stoichiometry of binding in these complexes of IGF 1 and its IGFBPs due to the heterogeneous size of the complexes caused by glycosylation.

IGF 1 naturally occurs in human body fluids for example blood and human cerebral spinal fluid. Although IGF 1 is produced in many tissues most circulating IGF 1 is believed to be synthesized in the liver. The IGFBPs are believed to modulate the biological activity of IGF 1 Jones and Clemmons supra with IGFBP 1 Lee et al. . 204 4 29 1993 being implicated as the primary binding protein involved in glucose metabolism Baxter Physiological roles of IGF binding proteins in Spencer Ed. Elsevier New York 1991 pp. 371 380 . IGFBP 1 production by the liver is regulated by nutritional status with insulin directly suppressing its production Suikkari et al. 66 266 272 1988 .

The function of IGFBP 1 in vivo is poorly understood. The administration of purified human IGFBP 1 to rats has been shown to cause an acute but small increase in blood glucose Lewitt et al. 129 2254 2256 1991 . The regulation of IGFBP 1 is somewhat better understood. It has been proposed Lewitt and Baxter 79 147 152 1991 that when blood glucose rises and insulin is secreted IGFBP 1 is suppressed allowing a slow increase in free IGF 1 levels that might assist insulin action on glucose transport. Such a scenario places the function of IGFBP 1 as a direct regulator of blood glucose.

In most cases addition of exogenous IGFBP blunts the effects of IGF 1. For example the growth stimulating effect of estradiol on the MCF 7 human breast cancer cells is associated with decreased IGFBP 3 mRNA and protein accumulation while the anti estrogen ICI 182780 causes growth inhibition and increased IGFBP 3 mRNA and protein levels Huynh et al. 271 1016 1021 1996 Oh et al. 6 503 512 1995 . It has also been reported that the in vitro inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation by retinoic acid may involve altered IGFBP secretion by tumor cells or decreased circulating IGF 1 levels in vivo LeRoith et al. 122 54 59 1995 Oh et al. 1995 supra . Contrary to this finding treatment of MCF 7 cells with the anti estrogen tamoxifen decreases IGF 1R signaling in a manner that is unrelated to decreased IGFBP production Lee et al. 152 39 1997 . Additional support for the general anti proliferative effects of the IGFBPs is the striking finding that IGFBP 3 is a target gene of the tumor suppressor p53 Buckbinder et al. 377 646 649 1995 . This suggests that the suppressor activity of p53 is in part mediated by IGFBP 3 production and the consequential blockade of IGF action Buckbinder et al. supra . These results indicate that the IGFBPs can block cell proliferation by modulating paracrine autocrine processes regulated by IGF 1 IGF 2. A corollary to these observations is the finding that prostate specific antigen PSA is an IGFBP 3 protease which upon activation increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to the actions of IGF 1 IGF 2 due to the proteolytic inactivation of IGFBP 3 Cohen et al. 142 407 415 1994 . The IGFBPs complex with IGF 1 IGF 2 and interfere with the access of IGF 1 IGF 2 to IGF 1Rs Clemmons et al. 692 10 21 1993 . IGFBP 1 2 and 3 inhibit cell growth following addition to cells in vitro Lee et al. 152 39 1997 Feyen et al. 266 19469 19474 1991 . Further IGFBP 1 McGuire et al. 84 1336 1341 1992 Figueroa et al. 157 229 236 1993 IGFBP 3 Oh et al. 1995 supra Pratt and Pollak 198 292 297 1994 and IGFBP 2 have all been shown to inhibit IGF 1 or estrogen induced breast cancer cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. These findings support the idea that the IGFBPs are potent antagonists of IGF action. There is also evidence for a direct effect of IGFBP 3 on cells through its own cell surface receptor independent of IGF interactions Oh et al. 268 14964 14971 1993 Valentinis et al. 9 361 367 1995 . Taken together these findings underscore the importance of IGF and IGF 1R as targets for therapeutic use.

IGFs have mitogenic and anti apoptotic influences on normal and transformed prostate epithelial cells Hsing et al. 56 5146 1996 Culig et al. 54 5474 1994 Cohen et al. 26 81 1994 Iwamura et al. 22 243 1993 Cohen et al. . 73 401 1991 Rajah et al. 272 12181 1997 . Most circulating IGF 1 originates in the liver but IGF bioactivity in tissues is related not only to levels of circulating IGFs and IGFBPs but also to local production of IGFs IGFBPs and IGFBP proteases Jones and Clemmons supra . Person to person variability in levels of circulating IGF 1 and IGFBP 3 the major circulating IGFBP Jones and Clemmons supra is considerable Juul et al. . 78 744 1994 Juul et al. . 80 2534 1995 and heterogeneity in serum IGF 1 levels appears to reflect heterogeneity in tissue IGF bioactivity. Markers relating to IGF axis components can be used as a risk marker for prostate cancer as PSA is likewise used WO 99 38011 .

Unlike most other growth factors the IGFs are present in high concentrations in the circulation but only a small fraction of the IGFs is not protein bound. For example it is generally known that in humans or rodents less than 1 of the IGFs in blood is in a free or unbound form Juul et al. 44 515 523 1996 Hizuka et al. 1 51 55 1991 Hasegawa et al. 80 3284 3286 1995 . The overwhelming majority of the IGFs in blood circulate as part of a non covalently associated ternary complex composed of IGF 1 or IGF 2 IGFBP 3 and a large protein termed the acid labile subunit ALS . The ternary complex of an IGF IGFBP 3 and ALS has a molecular weight of approximately 150 000 daltons and it has been suggested that the function of this complex in the circulation may be to serve as a reservoir and buffer for IGF 1 and IGF 2 preventing rapid changes in free IGF 1 or IGF 2.

There has been much work identifying the regions on IGF 1 and IGF 2 that bind to the IGFBPs Bayne et al. 265 15648 15652 1990 Dubaquie and Lowman 38 6386 6396 1999 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 077 276 5 164 370 and 5 470 828 . For example it has been discovered that the N terminal region of IGF 1 and IGF 2 is critical for binding to the IGFBPs U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 077 276 5 164 370 and 5 470 828 . Thus the natural IGF 1 variant designated des 1 3 IGF 1 binds poorly to IGFBPs.

A similar amount of research has been devoted to identifying the regions on IGF 1 and IGF 2 that bind to IGF 1R Bayne et al. supra Oh et al. 1993 supra . It was found that the tyrosine residues in IGF 1 at positions 24 31 and 60 are crucial to the binding of IGF 1 to IGF 1R Bayne et al. supra . Mutant IGF 1 molecules where one or more of these tyrosine residues are substituted showed progressively reduced binding to IGF 1R. Bayne et al. supra also investigated whether such mutants of IGF 1 could bind to IGF 1R and to the IGFBPs. They found that quite different residues on IGF 1 and IGF 2 are used to bind to the IGFBPs from those used to bind to IGF 1R. It is therefore possible to produce IGF variants that show reduced binding to the IGFBPs but because they bind well to IGF 1R show maintained activity in in vitro activity assays.

Also reported was an IGF variant that binds to IGFBPs but not to IGF receptors and therefore shows reduced activity in in vitro activity assays Bar et al. 127 3243 3245 1990 . In this variant designated 1 27 gly 38 70 hIGF 1 residues 28 37 of the C region of human IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 are replaced by a four residue glycine bridge.

Other truncated IGF 1 variants are disclosed. For example in the patent literature WO 96 33216 describes a truncated variant having residues 1 69 of authentic IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 . EP 742 228 discloses two chain IGF 1 superagonists which are derivatives of the naturally occurring single chain IGF 1 having an abbreviated C region. The IGF 1 analogs are of the formula BC A wherein B is the B region of IGF 1 or a functional analog thereof C is the C region of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 or a functional analog thereof n is the number of amino acids in the C region and is from about 6 to about 12 and A is the A region of IGF 1 or a functional analog thereof.

Additionally Cascieri et al. 27 3229 3233 1988 discloses four mutants of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 three of which have reduced affinity to IGF 1R. These mutants are Phe Phe Tyr IGF 1 which is equipotent to human IGF 1 in its affinity to the Types 1 and 2 IGF and insulin receptors Leu IGF 1 and Ser IGF 1 which have a lower affinity than IGF 1 to the human placental IGF 1R the placental insulin receptor and the IGF 1R of rat and mouse cells and desoctapeptide Leu IGF 1 in which the loss of aromaticity at position 24 is combined with the deletion of the carboxyl terminal D region of hIGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 which has lower affinity than Leu IGF 1 for the IGF 1R and higher affinity for the insulin receptor . These four mutants have normal affinities for human serum binding proteins.

Bayne et al. 263 6233 6239 1988 discloses four structural analogs of human IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 a B chain mutant in which the first 16 amino acids of IGF 1 were replaced with the first 17 amino acids of the B chain of insulin Gln Ala IGF 1 Tyr Leu IGF 1 and Gln Ala Tyr Leu IGF 1. These studies identify some of the regions of IGF 1 that are responsible for maintaining high affinity binding with the serum binding protein and the Type 2 IGF receptor.

In another study Bayne et al. 264 11004 11008 1988 discloses three structural analogs of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 1 62 IGF 1 which lacks the carboxyl terminal 8 amino acid D region of IGF 1 1 27 Gly 38 70 IGF 1 in which residues 28 37 of the C region of IGF 1 are replaced by a four residue glycine bridge and 1 27 Gly 38 62 IGF 1 with a C region glycine replacement and a D region deletion Peterkofsky et al. 128 1769 1779 1991 discloses data using the Glymutant of Bayne et al. supra vol. 264 .

Cascieri et al. 264 2199 2202 1989 discloses three IGF 1 analogs in which specific residues in the A region of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 are replaced with the corresponding residues in the A chain of insulin. The analogs are 

 Ile Glu Gln Thr Ser Ile Ser Tyr Gln IGF 1 an A chain mutant in which residue 41 is changed from threonine to isoleucine and residues 42 56 of the A region are replaced 

Clemmons et al. 265 12210 12216 1990 discloses use of IGF 1 analogs that have reduced binding affinity for either IGF 1R or binding proteins to study the ligand specificity of IGFBP 1 and the role of IGFBP 1 in modulating the biological activity of IGF 1.

WO 94 04569 discloses a specific binding molecule other than a natural IGFBP that is capable of binding to IGF 1 and can enhance the biological activity of IGF 1.

Peptides that bind to IGFBP 1 block IGF 1 binding to this binding protein and thereby release free IGF activity from mixtures of IGF 1 and IGFBP 1 have been recently described Lowman et al. 37 8870 8878 1998 WO 98 45427 published Oct. 15 1998 Lowman et al. International Pediatric Nephrology Association Fifth Symposium on Growth and Development in Children with Chronic Renal Failure New York Mar. 13 1999 . Also described is the natural molecule des 1 3 IGF 1 which shows selectively reduced affinity for some of the IGF binding proteins yet a maintained affinity for the IGF receptor U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 077 276 5 164 370 5 470 828 .

Exploitation of the interaction between IGF and IGFBP in screening preventing or treating disease has been limited however because of a lack of specific antagonists. To date only one publication is known to exist that describes the application of an IGF 1 IGF 2 antagonist as a potential therapeutic adjunct in the treatment of cancer Pietrzkowski et al. 52 6447 6451 1992 . In that report a peptide corresponding to the D region of IGF 1 was synthesized for use as an IGF 1 2 antagonist. This peptide exhibited questionable inhibitory activity against IGF 1. The basis for the observed inhibition is unclear as the D region does not play a significant role in IGF 1R binding but rather in IGF 1 binding to the insulin receptor Cooke et al. 30 5484 5491 1991 Bayne et al. supra Vol. 264 Yee et al. 5 73 77 1994 .

WO 00 23469 discloses the portions of IGFBP and IGF peptides that account for IGF IGFBP binding i.e. an isolated IGF binding domain of an IGFBP or modification thereof that binds IGF with at least about the same binding affinity as the full length IGFBP. The patent publication also discloses an IGF antagonist that reduces binding of IGF to an IGF receptor and or binds to a binding domain of IGFBP.

Additionally WO 93 23067 discloses pharmaceutical compositions comprising short peptides that function as IGF 1 receptor antagonists. The peptides used in the pharmaceutical compositions consist of less than 25 amino acids comprise at least a portion of the C or D region from IGF 1 and inhibit IGF 1 induced autophosphorylation of IGF 1 receptors.

Polypeptides including the IGF molecules have a three dimensional structure determined by the primary amino acid sequence and the environment surrounding the polypeptide. This three dimensional structure establishes the activity stability binding affinity binding specificity and other biochemical attributes of the polypeptide. Thus knowledge of the three dimensional structure of a protein can provide much guidance in designing agents that mimic inhibit or improve its biological activity in soluble or membrane bound forms.

The three dimensional structure of a polypeptide may be determined in a number of ways. Many of the most precise methods employ x ray crystallography Van Holde Prentice Hall N.J. 1971 pp. 221 239 . This technique relies on the ability of crystalline lattices to diffract x ray or other forms of radiation. Diffraction experiments suitable for determining the three dimensional structure of macromolecules typically require high quality crystals. Unfortunately such crystals have been unavailable for IGF 1 as well as many other proteins of interest. Crystals have been described for M CSF EP 668 914B1 CD40 ligand WO 97 00895 and a BC2 Fab fragment WO 99 01476 for example.

The crystallization of insulin is an intensively researched field both with respect to work on structural analysis Adams et al. 224 491 1969 and pharmaceutical applications. Examples of insulin crystal suspensions that are used therapeutically include suspensions of rhombohedral zinc insulin crystals that are stable in the presence of 0.8 to 2.5 of zinc based on the weight of insulin at a neutral pH value and exhibit a delayed action and isophane insulin protamine crystals which are used in delayed action products in the form of small rods. A few other crystal modifications of insulin are furthermore known but these have hitherto been of interest only for X ray structure analysis. Thus zinc free orthorhombic and monoclinic crystals have been obtained under acid pH conditions Einstein and Low 15 32 34 1962 . Smaller rhombic dodecahedra which are to be classified in the cubic space group have been obtained at the isoelectric point also in the absence of zinc. Finally a monoclinic crystal form of insulin has been obtained above the isoelectric point in the presence of zinc and in the presence of phenol or phenol derivatives. These crystals grow to a considerable size up to 3 mm within a few days and have sharp edges. Interestingly these crystals have been found only on glass surfaces and not on the free surface of the solution. Crystal suspensions and other crystal forms of insulin preparations and insulin analogs are described for example in such representative patents as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 959 351 5 840 680 5 834 422 6 127 334 5 952 297 5 650 486 5 898 028 5 898 067 5 948 751 5 747 642 5 597 893 5 547 930 5 534 488 5 504 188 5 461 031 and 5 028 587.

Various methods for preparing crystalline proteins and polypeptides are known in the art McPherson et al. Preparation and Analysis of Protein Crystals McPherson Robert E. Krieger Publishing Company Malabar Fla. 1989 Weber Advances in Protein Chemistry 41 1 36 1991 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 672 108 and 4 833 233 . Although there are multiple approaches to crystallizing polypeptides no single set of conditions provides a reasonable expectation of success especially when the crystals must be suitable for x ray diffraction studies. Significant effort is required to obtain crystals of sufficient size and resolution to provide accurate information regarding the structure. For example once a protein of sufficient purity is obtained it must be crystallized to a size and clarity that is useful for x ray diffraction and subsequent structure resolution. Further although the amino acid sequence of a target protein may be known this sequence information does not allow an accurate prediction of the crystal structure of the protein. Nor does the sequence information afford an understanding of the structural conformational and chemical interactions between a ligand such as an IGFBP and its protein target. Thus although crystal structures can provide a wealth of valuable information in the field of drug design and discovery crystals of certain biologically relevant compounds such as IGF 1 are not readily available to those skilled in the art. High quality diffracting crystals of IGF 1 would assist the determination of its three dimensional structure.

Generation of specific IGF 1 antagonists has been restricted at least in part because of difficulties in studying the structure of IGF and IGFBPs. Due to the inability to obtain crystals of IGF 1 suitable for diffraction studies for example an extrapolation of IGF 1 structure based on the crystal structure of porcine insulin was the most important structural road map for IGF 1 available Blundell et al. 75 180 184 1978 . See also Blundell et al. 42 2592 2597 1983 which discloses tertiary structures receptor binding and antigenicity of IGFs. Based on studies of chemically modified and mutated IGF 1 a number of common residues between IGF 1 and insulin have been identified as being part of the IGF 1R insulin receptor contact site in particular the aromatic residues at positions 23 25.

Using NMR and restrained molecular dynamics the solution structure of IGF 1 was recently reported Cooke et al. supra . The resulting minimized structure was shown to better fit the experimental findings on modified IGF 1 as well as the extrapolations made from the structure activity studies of insulin. Further De Wolf et al. 5 2193 2202 1996 discloses the solution structure of a mini IGF 1. Sato et al. 41 433 440 1993 discloses the three dimensional structure of IGF 1 determined by H NMR and distance geometry. Laajoki et al. 275 10009 10015 2000 discloses the solution structure and backbone dynamics of long Arg 3 IGF 1. See also Laajoki et al. 420 97 102 1997 . The small number of NMR models available for IGF 1 are not very well defined as there are large RMSDs between the backbone atoms of the helical segments. The best NMR model is of IGF 2 in which three alpha helices are shown. See Torres et al. 248 385 401 1995 which discloses the solution structure of human IGF 2 and its relationship to receptor and binding protein interactions. In all structures the C and D regions are very poorly defined.

In addition to providing structural information crystalline polypeptides provide other advantages. For example the crystallization process itself further purifies the polypeptide and satisfies one of the classical criteria for homogeneity. In fact crystallization frequently provides unparalleled purification quality removing impurities that are not removed by other purification methods such as HPLC dialysis conventional column chromatography etc. Moreover crystalline polypeptides are often stable at ambient temperatures and free of protease contamination and other degradation associated with solution storage. Crystalline polypeptides may also be useful as pharmaceutical preparations. Finally crystallization techniques in general are largely free of problems such as denaturation associated with other stabilization methods e.g. lyophilization . Thus there exists a significant need for preparing IGF 1 compositions in crystalline form and determining their three dimensional structure. The present invention fulfills this and other needs. Once crystallization has been accomplished crystallographic data provides useful structural information that may assist the design of peptides that may serve as agonists or antagonists. In addition the crystal structure provides information useful to map the receptor binding domain which could then be mimicked by a small non peptide molecule that may serve as an antagonist or agonist. Also findings regarding the detergent s inhibition of the binding of IGFBP to IGF 1 can be used to identify new IGF 1 agonists.

Accordingly the invention is as claimed. IGF 1 has been crystallized and its structure determined using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction MAD at 1.8 angstroms resolution by exploiting the anomalous scattering of a single bromide ion and six of the seven sulfur atoms of IGF 1. The C region of IGF 1 which is ordered in the crystal structure forms a type II beta turn and mediates a crystal packing interaction across a crystallographic dyad. The solution state of IGF 1 was characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation and the results indicate that IGF 1 exists primarily as a monomer at neutral pH with only a slight tendency to dimerize at millimolar concentrations. A molecule of detergent N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine deoxy big CHAPS mediates a crystal packing contact between symmetry related molecules. Biophysical and biochemical data show that the N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine binds to IGF 1 specifically and blocks binding of IGFBP 1 and IGFBP 3.

An electron density map may be used to establish the positions of the individual atoms within the unit cell of the crystal.

Those of skill in the art understand that a set of structural coordinates determined by x ray crystallography is not without standard error. Appendix 1 shows the atomic coordinates of IGF 1.

Phases can then be calculated from this model and combined with the observed amplitudes to give an approximated Fourier synthesis of the structure whose coordinates are unknown. This in turn can be subject to any of the several forms of refinement to provide a final accurate structure of the unknown crystal. See e.g. Lattman E. Use of the Rotation and Translation Functions 115 55 77 1985 Rossman ed. The Molecular Replacement Method . No. 13 Gordon and Breach New York 1972 . Using the structural coordinates of IGF 1 provided by this invention molecular replacement may be used to determine the structural coordinates of a crystalline co complex unknown ligand mutant or homolog or of a different crystalline form of IGF 1. Additionally the claimed crystal and its coordinates may be used to determine the structural coordinates of a chemical entity that associates with IGF 1.

The term chemical entity or compound as used herein means any molecule molecular complex compound peptidomimetic or fragment thereof that is not IGF 1. Preferably it is a molecule with high oral bioavailability such as an organic chemical molecule or a peptide.

The following detailed description of the invention encompasses the crystal structure of IGF 1 methods of making an IGF 1 crystal and methods of using an IGF 1 crystal and its structural coordinates.

The claimed invention provides crystals of IGF 1 as well as the structure of IGF 1 determined therefrom. Specifically the claimed invention provides crystals of IGF 1 having approximately the following dimensions a 31.831 b 71.055 c 65.995 90.000 . It has a symmetry or space group of C222. The ribbon structure thereof is shown in having three helices with the N terminal B region corresponding to residues 3 28 the C region from residues 29 34 a stretch of poorly ordered residues from residues 35 40 and the A region from residues 42 62. The D region residues 63 70 is essentially disordered. show that the detergent used in the crystallization binds into a small hydrophobic cleft at the base of the B helix of the structure. The IGF 1 can form a dimer in the crystal as shown in wherein the two tails are positioned at the dimer interface. The buried surface area is 689 monomer which is 1378 total. The residues important for IGF 1R binding cluster at the dimer interface as shown in .

The characteristics of the claimed IGF 1 crystal are further described in the Example herein and the structural coordinates thereof are provided in Appendix 1.

In various embodiments the claimed invention relates to methods of preparing crystalline forms of IGF 1 by first providing an aqueous solution comprising IGF 1. A reservoir solution comprising a precipitant is then mixed with a volume of the IGF 1 solution and the resultant mixed volume is then crystallized. In a preferred step the crystals are again dissolved and recrystallized. An example of a reagent that can be used for recrystallization is methyl pentanediol which is preferred. The crystals are typically dissolved with this reagent in a small amount to minimize dilution effects of the other reagents and left to regrow for a period of time. In an optional step the crystalline IGF 1 is isolated from the mixed volume. Preferably the IGF 1 is obtained from a prokaryotic cell more preferably a bacterial cell most preferably . Preferably it is secreted into the periplasm and prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 723 310.

The concentration of IGF 1 in the aqueous solution may vary but is preferably about 1 to 50 mg ml more preferably about 5 to 15 mg ml. Similarly precipitants used in the invention may vary and may be selected from any precipitant known in the art. Preferably the precipitant is selected from the group consisting of sodium citrate ammonium sulfate polyethylene glycol sodium cacodylate or a mixture thereof. More preferably the precipitant is polyethylene glycol buffered with sodium citrate or sodium cacodylate. Any concentration of precipitant may be used in the reservoir solution however it is preferred that the concentration be about 20 to 25 if polyethylene glycol and about 1 to 10 M if sodium citrate ammonium sulfate or sodium cacodylate. Preferably the reservoir solution further comprises a detergent. Preferably the detergent is present in an amount of about 10 to 50 mM. Also preferably the detergent is N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine. The pH of the reservoir solution may also be varied preferably between about 4 to 10 most preferably about 6.5.

One skilled in the art will understand that each of these parameters can be varied without undue experimentation and acceptable crystals will still be obtained. In practice once the appropriate precipitating agents buffers or other experimental variables are determined for any given growth method any of these methods or any other methods can be used to grow the claimed crystals. One skilled in the art can determine the variables depending upon one s particular needs.

Various methods of crystallization can be used in the claimed invention including vapor diffusion batch liquid bridge or dialysis crystallization. Vapor diffusion crystallization is preferred. See e.g. McPherson et al. Glick ed. John Wiley Co. 1982 pp. 82 159 Jancarik et al. 24 409 411 1991 .

In vapor diffusion crystallization a small volume i.e. a few milliliters of protein solution is mixed with a solution containing a precipitant. This mixed volume is suspended over a well containing a small amount i.e. about 1 ml of precipitant. Vapor diffusion from the drop to the well will result in crystal formation in the drop.

The dialysis method of crystallization utilizes a semipermeable size exclusion membrane that retains the protein but allows small molecules i.e. buffers and precipitants to diffuse in and out. In dialysis rather than concentrating the protein and the precipitant by evaporation the precipitant is allowed to slowly diffuse through the membrane and reduce the solubility of the protein while keeping the protein concentration fixed.

The batch methods generally involve the slow addition of a precipitant to an aqueous solution of protein until the solution just becomes turbid at this point the container can be sealed and left undisturbed for a period of time until crystallization occurs.

Thus applicants intend that the claimed invention encompass any and all methods of crystallization. One skilled in the art can choose any of such methods and vary the parameters such that the chosen method results in the desired crystals.

The most preferred method of crystallization involves the method wherein the IGF 1 after isolation from the cell and formulation in for example an acetate citrate or succinate buffer as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 681 814 and WO 99 51272 is optionally desalted if necessary to a pH of about 4 5 preferably about 4.5 to form an aqueous solution. Then a droplet of the aqueous solution is mixed with about 24 polyethylene glycol buffered to about pH 6.5 with either about 0.1M sodium citrate or about 0.1M sodium cacodylate and with about 1 l of about 1.4 mM N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine as detergent. This solution is then equilibrated by vapor diffusion crystallization with about 1 mL of about 24 polyethylene glycol buffered to about pH 6.5 with either about 0.1M sodium citrate or about 0.1M sodium cacodylate until crystallization droplets are formed usually about 4 5 days. Then about 2 l of about 100 methyl pentanediol is added to the crystallization droplets so as to dissolve the crystals overnight and thereby form new crystals usually within a week s time.

The crystal structure was determined by combined anomalous scattering from intrinsic sulfur and fortuitous bromide ion as discussed in detail in the Example below.

The crystalline IGF 1 herein can be used for various purposes. For example the crystallization process itself further purifies the IGF 1 to homogeneity. Thus one such purpose is to provide a highly purified IGF 1 that can be used as a standard or control in a diagnostic setting for example as a molecular weight marker or as an ELISA radioassay or radioreceptor assay control. Moreover crystalline IGF 1 is stable at room temperature can be lyophilized readily and is less apt to degrade than less pure compositions.

In another use for the invention herein crystals of IGF 1 of a size and quality to allow performance of x ray diffraction studies enable those of skill in the art to conduct studies relating to the binding properties of IGF 1 as well as the binding properties of IGFBPs IGF 1 receptors and ALS that associate with the IGF 1.

Furthermore structural information derived from a peptide crystal structure can be used for the identification of chemical entities for example small organic and bioorganic molecules such as peptidomimetics and synthetic organic molecules that bind IGF 1 and preferably block or prevent an IGF 1 mediated or associated process or event or that act as IGF 1 agonists. An exemplary approach to such a structure based compound design is described in Pandi Veerapandian ed. Marcell Dekker New York 1997 .

By way of example having determined the three dimensional structure of the IGF 1 the skilled artisan constructs a model of the IGF 1 such as those depicted in . Since every atom of a peptide or polypeptide can be depicted as a sphere of the appropriate van der Waals radius a detailed surface map of the folded IGF 1 can be constructed. The surface that results is known as the van der Waals surface. The solvent accessible surface is the surface that is accessible to a chemical probe a water molecule herein and is constructed by rolling a water molecule of appropriate radius on the outside of the peptide maintaining contact with the van der Waals surface. Those parts of the van der Waals surface that contact the surface of the water molecule define a continuous surface known as the solvent accessible surface. Creighton Thomas E. 2nd. ed. W.H. Freeman and Company 1984 pp 227 229 .

Such chemical entities presenting a solvent accessible surface that mimics the solvent accessible surface of the IGF 1 can be constructed by those skilled in the art. By way of example the skilled artisan can search three dimensional structural databases of compounds to identify those compounds that position appropriate functional groups in similar 3 dimensional structural arrangement then build combinatorial chemistry libraries around such chemical entities to identify those with high affinity.

One approach enabled by this invention is the use of the structural coordinates of IGF 1 to design chemical entities that bind to or associate with IGF 1 and alter the physical properties of the chemical entities in different ways. Thus properties such as for example solubility affinity specificity potency on off rates or other binding characteristics may all be altered and or maximized.

One may design desired chemical entities by probing an IGF 1 crystal with a library of different entities to determine optimal sites for interaction between candidate chemical entities and IGF 1. For example high resolution x ray diffraction data collected from crystals saturated with solvent allows the determination of where each type of solvent molecule adheres. Small molecules that bind tightly to those sites can then be designed and synthesized and tested for the desired activity. Once the desired activity is obtained the molecules can be further altered to maximize desirable properties.

The invention also contemplates computational screening of small molecule databases or designing of chemical entities that can bind in whole or in part to IGF 1. They may also be used to solve the crystal structure of mutants co complexes or the crystalline form of any other molecule homologous to or capable of associating with at least a portion of IGF 1.

One method that may be employed for this purpose is molecular replacement. An unknown crystal structure which may be any unknown structure such as for example another crystal form of IGF 1 an IGF 1 mutant or peptide or a co complex with IGF 1 or any other unknown crystal of a chemical entity that associates with IGF 1 that is of interest may be determined using the structural coordinates as set forth in Appendix 1. Co complexes with IGF 1 may include but are not limited to IGF 1 IGFBP 3 IGF 1 IGFBP 3 ALS IGF 1 receptor IGF 1 peptide or IGF 1 small molecule. This method will provide an accurate structural form for the unknown crystal far more quickly and efficiently than attempting to determine such information without the invention herein.

The information obtained can thus be used to obtain maximally effective inhibitors or agonists of IGF 1. The design of chemical entities that inhibit or agonize IGF 1 generally involves consideration of at least two factors. First the chemical entity must be capable of physically or structurally associating with IGF 1. The association may be any physical structural or chemical association such as for example covalent or noncovalent bonding or van der Waals hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions.

Second the chemical entity must be able to assume a conformation that allows it to associate with IGF 1. Although not all portions of the chemical entity will necessarily participate in the association with IGF 1 those non participating portions may still influence the overall conformation of the molecule. This in turn may have a significant impact on the desirability of the chemical entity. Such conformational requirements include the overall three dimensional structure and orientation of the chemical entity in relation to all or a portion of the binding site.

The potential inhibitory or binding effect of a chemical entity on IGF 1 may be analyzed prior to its actual synthesis and testing by the use of computer modeling techniques. If the theoretical structure of the given chemical entity suggests insufficient interaction and association between it and IGF 1 the need for synthesis and testing of the chemical entity is obviated. However if computer modeling indicates a strong interaction the molecule may then be synthesized and tested for its ability to bind to IGF 1. Thus expensive and time consuming synthesis of inoperative compounds may be avoided.

An inhibitory or other binding compound of IGF 1 may be computationally evaluated and designed by means of a series of steps in which chemical entities or fragments are screened and selected for their ability to associate with the individual binding sites of IGF 1.

Thus one skilled in the art may use one of several methods to screen chemical entities or fragments for their ability to associate with IGF 1. This process may begin by visual inspection of for example the binding site on a computer screen based on the IGF 1 coordinates in Appendix 1. Selected fragments or chemical entities may then be positioned in a variety of orientations or docked within an individual binding pocket of IGF 1. Docking may be accomplished using software such as Quanta and Sybyl followed by energy minimization and molecular dynamics with standard molecular mechanics force fields such as CHARMM and AMBER.

Specialized computer programs may be of use for selecting interesting fragments or chemical entities. These programs include for example GRID available from Oxford University Oxford UK MCSS or CATALYST available from Molecular Simulations Burlington Mass. AUTODOCK available from Scripps Research Institute La Jolla Calif. DOCK available from University of California San Francisco Calif. and XSITE available from University College of London UK.

Once suitable chemical entities or fragments have been selected they can be assembled into an inhibitor or agonist. Assembly may be by visual inspection of the relationship of the fragments to each other on the three dimensional image displayed on a computer screen in relation to the structural coordinates disclosed herein.

Alternatively one may design the desired chemical entities de novo experimentally using either an empty binding site or optionally including a portion of a molecule with desired activity. Thus for example one may use solid phase screening techniques where either IGF 1 or a fragment thereof or candidate chemical entities to be evaluated are attached to a solid phase thereby identifying potential binders for further study.

Basically any molecular modeling techniques may be employed in accordance with the invention these techniques are known or readily available to those skilled in the art. It will be understood that the methods and compositions disclosed herein can be used to identify design or characterize not only entities that will associate or bind to IGF 1 but alternatively to identify design or characterize entities that like IGF 1 will bind to the receptor thereby disrupting the IGF 1 receptor interaction. The claimed invention is intended to encompass these methods and compositions broadly.

Once a compound has been designed or selected by the above methods the efficiency with which that compound may bind to IGF 1 may be tested and modified for the maximum desired characteristic s using computational or experimental evaluation. Various parameters can be maximized depending on the desired result. These include but are not limited to specificity affinity on off rates hydrophobicity solubility and other characteristics readily identifiable by the skilled artisan.

Additionally the invention is useful for the production of small molecule drug candidates. Thus the claimed crystal structures may be also used to obtain information about the crystal structures of complexes of the IGF 1 and small molecule inhibitors. For example if the small molecule inhibitor is co crystallized with IGF 1 then the crystal structure of the complex can be solved by molecular replacement using the known coordinates of IGF 1 for the calculation of phases. Such information is useful for example for determining the nature of the interaction between the IGF 1 and the small molecule inhibitor and thus may suggest modifications that would improve binding characteristics such as affinity specificity and kinetics.

The invention herein is also useful in providing a method of identifying indirect agonists of IGF 1 based on the inhibitory properties of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine with respect to IGFBPs. This method comprises the steps of comparing the ability of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine to inhibit binding of IGFBP 1 or 3 to IGF 1 with the ability of a candidate IGF 1 indirect agonist to inhibit such binding and determining whether the candidate IGF 1 indirect agonist can inhibit such binding at least as well as N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine can so inhibit the binding.

Preferably the comparison is accomplished by competition assay between N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine and the candidate IGF 1 indirect agonist using ICto measure ability to inhibit IGFBP binding. In a more preferred embodiment inhibition of binding is measured by pre incubating N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine or the candidate agonist molecule with IGF 1 expressed on bacteriophage particles and measuring residual binding of IGF 1 to IGFBP 1 or IGFBP 3 in a plate based assay such as an ELISA.

The invention further provides a method of identifying indirect agonists of IGF 1 comprising co crystallizing the candidate agonist with IGF 1 to form a co crystalline structure and determining if the candidate agonist molecule binds to one or both of two patches on IGF 1. The first patch contains the amino acid residues Glu 3 Thr 4 Leu 5 Asp 12 Ala 13 Phe 16 Val 17 Cys 47 Ser 51 Cys 52 Asp 53 Leu 54 and Leu 57 and the second patch contains the amino acid residues Val 11 Gln 15 Phe 23 Phe 25 Asn 26 Val 44 Phe 49 and Arg 55 of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 . For purposes herein binding means that there is at least one contact between each listed amino acid residue of a given patch and the candidate agonist molecule that is less than or equal to 6 angstroms in the co crystalline structure. Such a candidate agonist molecule will have the property of inhibiting binding of IGFBP 1 or IGFBP 3 to IGF 1. The preferred such candidate agonist molecule will inhibit binding of IGFBP 1 or 3 to IGF 1 at least as well as N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine. More preferred is the method wherein inhibition of binding is measured using a competition assay between N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine and the candidate agonist molecule. Most preferred is the method wherein inhibition of binding is measured by pre incubating N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine or the candidate agonist molecule with IGF 1 expressed on bacteriophage particles and measuring residual binding of IGF 1 to IGFBP 1 or IGFBP 3 in a plate based ELISA assay.

The N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine detergent herein can be used as a template to perform design of small molecule drugs that elicit the same effect as the detergent compete with IGF 1 for IGFBP binding and subsequent disruption of the interaction of IGFBP with IGF 1 to free IGF 1 in situ so that it is active and will interact with the receptor. As opposed to the other detergents tested in the Examples below N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine lacks an oxygen atom at position C10. This region of the detergent is in close contact with the side chain atoms of residues Leu 5 Leu 54 and Leu 57 of IGF 1. Molecules with this same type of conformation would work as indirect IGF 1 agonists.

The indirect agonist so identified can be used in a method for treating an agonist disorder wherein an effective amount of the indirect agonist of IGF 1 is administered to a mammal with such a disorder. Hence such agonist may be used therapeutically in a pharmaceutical preparation for example in clinical trials or commercialized for the agonist disorders as defined herein. Thus the formulation of the indirect agonist herein can be used to treat any condition that would benefit from treatment with IGF 1 including for example diabetes chronic and acute renal disorders such as chronic renal insufficiency necrosis etc. obesity hyperinsulinemia GH insufficiency Turner s syndrome short stature undesirable symptoms associated with aging such as increasing lean mass to fat ratios immuno deficiencies including increasing CD4 counts and increasing immune tolerance catabolic states associated with wasting etc. Laron dwarfism insulin resistance and so forth.

For therapeutic use the indirect agonist composition herein may be directly administered to the mammal by any suitable technique including orally parenterally intranasally or intrapulmonarily and can be administered locally or systemically. The specific route of administration will depend e.g. on the medical history of the patient including any perceived or anticipated side or reduced effects using IGF 1 and the disorder to be treated. Examples of parenteral administration include subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous intraarterial and intraperitoneal administration. Most preferably the administration is by continuous infusion using e.g. minipumps such as osmotic pumps or by injection using e.g. intravenous or subcutaneous means . The administration may also be as a single bolus or by slow release depot formulation. Most preferably the direct agonist is administered orally or by infusion or injection at a frequency of preferably one half once twice or three times daily most preferably daily.

The agonist composition to be used in the therapy will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient especially the side effects of treatment with the agonist the site of delivery of the agonist composition the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to clinical practitioners. The effective amount of agonist for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations and must be an amount that treats the disorder in question.

As a general proposition the total pharmaceutically effective amount of agonist administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 1 g kg day up to about 100 mg kg day preferably 10 g kg day up to about 10 mg kg day. If given continuously the agonist is generally administered in doses of about 1 g kg hour up to about 100 g kg hour either by about 14 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions for example using a minipump or a portable infusion pump. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed. The key factor in selecting an appropriate dose is the result obtained as measured by criteria as are deemed appropriate by the practitioner. If the agonist is administered together with insulin the latter is used in lower amounts than if used alone down to amounts which by themselves have little effect on blood glucose i.e. in amounts of between about 0.1 IU kg 24 hour to about 0.5 IU kg 24 hour.

For parenteral administration in one embodiment the agonist is formulated generally by mixing it at the desired degree of purity in a unit dosage injectable form solution suspension or emulsion with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier i.e. one that is non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. For example the formulation preferably does not include oxidizing agents and other compounds that are known to be deleterious to polypeptides.

Generally the formulation is prepared by contacting the agonist uniformly and intimately with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both. Preferably the carrier is a parenteral carrier more preferably a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water saline Ringer s solution and dextrose solution. Non aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein as well as liposomes.

The carrier suitably contains minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate succinate acetic acid and other organic acids or their salts antioxidants such as ascorbic acid low molecular weight less than about ten residues polypeptides e.g. polyarginine or tripeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone glycine amino acids such as glutamic acid aspartic acid or arginine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol counterions such as sodium nonionic surfactants such as polysorbates poloxamers or PEG and or neutral salts e.g. NaCl KCl MgCl CaCl etc.

The agonist is typically formulated individually in such vehicles at a concentration of about 0.1 mg ml to 100 mg ml preferably 1 10 mg ml at a pH of about 4.5 to 8. The final formulation if a liquid is preferably stored at a temperature of about 2 8EC for up to about four weeks. Alternatively the formulation can be lyophilized and provided as a powder for reconstitution with water for injection that is stored as described for the liquid formulation.

The agonist to be used for therapeutic administration must be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes e.g. 0.2 micron membranes . Therapeutic agonist compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port for example an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.

The agonist ordinarily will be stored in unit or multi dose containers for example sealed ampoules or vials as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution.

The invention will be more fully understood by reference to the following examples. They should not however be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. The disclosures of all literature and patent citations mentioned herein are expressly incorporated by reference.

Recombinant human IGF 1 rhIGF 1 was obtained as described in the Examples of U.S. Pat. No. 5 723 310 using a polymer salt combination for phase forming species and formulated as described in the Examples of U.S. Pat. No. 5 681 814 acetate NaCl polysorbate 20 and benzyl alcohol . Specifically the initial isolation of IGF 1 from was achieved using aqueous two phase separation Hart et al. 12 1113 1117 1994 followed by refolding Hart et al. 20 217 232 1994 and subsequent chromatographic purification including large scale reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography Olson et al. 675 101 112 1994 . It was placed in a vial containing 7 ml of 10 mg ml rhIGF 1. Prior to crystallization the IGF 1 was desalted into 0.15 M NaCl and 20 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 and diluted to a final concentration of 10 mg ml. Initially crystallization trials were set up in the presence of 1 mM of an IGF 1 binding peptide. However no peptide was ever observed in the crystal and crystals grown in the absence of the peptide were later shown to be isomorphous to the specimen reported here. A 4 l droplet of the IGF 1 solution was mixed with 5 l of reservoir solution 24 polyethylene glycol 3350 buffered to pH 6.5 with 0.1M sodium cacodylate and 1 l of 14 mM of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine which is obtained in a CRYSTAL SCREEN reagent kit used for crystallization condition screenings and available from Hampton Research Inc. Laguna Nigel Calif. This solution was allowed to equilibrate via vapor diffusion Jancarik et al. supra with 1 ml of reservoir solution. Thus a drop of the mixture was suspended under a plastic cover slip over the reservoir solution. Small crystals with a thin plate like morphology appeared within 4 5 days. At this point 2 l of 100 methyl pentanediol MPD to a final concentration of 20 was added to the crystallization droplet and the crystals dissolved overnight. Within 1 week crystals reappeared and grew to final dimensions of 0.2 mm 0.1 mm 0.05 mm with noticeably sharper edges. These crystals were used for all subsequent analysis.

Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the aforesaid crystallization conditions can be varied. By varying the crystallization conditions other crystal forms of IGF 1 may be obtained. Such variations may be used alone or in combination and include for example varying final protein concentrations between about 5 and 35 mg ml varying the IGF 1 to precipitant ratio varying precipitant concentrations between about 20 and 30 for polyethylene glycol varying pH ranges between about 5.5 and 7.5 varying the concentration or type of detergent varying the temperature between about 5 and 30 C. and crystallizing IGF 1 by batch liquid bridge or dialysis methods using the above conditions or variations thereof. See McPherson et al. 1982 supra.

A single crystal was transferred from the mother liquor to a cryo protectant solution consisting of 25 w v polyethylene glycol 3350 30 MPD 0.2 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 2.8 mM of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine and 1 M NaBr. The diffraction was to 1.8 . After 30 seconds in this solution the crystal was flash cooled by plunging it into liquid nitrogen. The technique of freezing the crystals essentially immortalizes them and produces a much higher quality data set. All subsequent manipulations and x ray data collection were performed at 100 Kelvin.

A 4 wavelength MAD data set was collected at beamline 9 2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory with the order of the data sets as follows Br peak 1 low energy remote 2 Br inflection 3 and high energy remote 4 . The Br peak and inflection points were estimated from fluorescence scans of the crystal and the low energy remote was chosen to be 1.54 angstroms to maximize the small sulfur anomalous signal at this wavelength while minimizing absorption effects. No inverse beam geometry was used. Data reduction was performed using Denzo and Scalepack Otwinowski and Minor 276 307 326 1997 . To determine the most accurate scale and B factors possible data for all four wavelengths were initially scaled together assuming no anomalous signal. The scale and B factors determined from this scaling run were then applied to each of the four data sets.

The crystals belong to space group C222with unit cell dimensions or constants of a 31.83 b 71.06 and c 66.00 . 90.000 . The asymmetric unit of the crystals contained a monomer of IGF 1 bound to a single detergent molecule yielding a Matthew s coefficient of 2.4 Da or 48.1 solvent. The solvent content of the crystals was about 55 .

Initial attempts at determining the structure of IGF 1 by molecular replacement using either the available NMR models of IGF 1 or the crystal structure of insulin were unsuccessful. For this reason the structure was determined de novo by Br multiwavelength anomalous dispersion MAD Dauter et al. 56 232 237 2000 .

The coordinates of the single bound bromide were determined by manual inspection of the anomalous and dispersive difference Patterson maps. The hand ambiguity was resolved by phase refinement using the program SHARP De La Fortelle and Bricogne 276 472 494 1997 from Global Phasing Limited 43 Newton Road Cambridge CB2 2AL ENGLAND followed by examination of anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated using the 2 Bijvoet differences. A cluster of six peaks for one hand of the Br coordinates was consistent with the disulfide structure of insulin PDB entry 1ZNI . These six peaks correspond to the six Cys S atoms in IGF 1 a seventh sulfur Met 59 S was never detected in anomalous difference Fourier maps presumably due to its higher temperature factor 36.7 . At this point the six Cys S positions were included in the phase refinement with the 1 data set used as a reference. Throughout the phase refinement the Br f was refined for the 1 data set f and f were refined for 3 and both were kept fixed for data sets 2 and 4 the f and f values for sulfur were kept fixed at the theoretical values for each wavelength. The small anomalous signal from the sulfur atoms had a modest effect on the phasing statistics but the resulting electron density maps showed improved connectivity especially in the less well ordered regions of IGF 1.

Density modification solvent flattening and histogram mapping was performed using DM Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 50 760 763 1994 Cowtan 4 31 34 38 1994 and the resulting electron density maps were of high quality. Approximately 50 of the structure corresponding to the three helical regions of IGF 1 was built directly into the experimental electron density maps using the programs O Jones et al. 47 110 119 1991 and QUANTA version 97.0 MSI San Diego Calif. . Several rounds of phase combination using Sigmaa Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 supra Read 42 140 149 1986 allowed the remainder of the molecule to be modeled. Atomic positional and restrained B factor refinement utilized the maximum likelihood target function of CNX Br nger et al. 54 905 921 1998 and MSI San Diego Calif. coupled with a mask type bulk solvent correction and anisotropic overall B factor scaling.

The final model contains residues 3 34 and 41 64 of IGF 1 one N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine molecule 1 Br and 50 water molecules. The model was refined against the 3 data set since the data statistics demonstrated this data set to be of higher quality than the others. All data from 20 to 1.8 angstrom resolution were included in the refinement with no application of a sigma cutoff. Secondary structure assignments were made with the program PROMOTIF Jones et al. supra Hutchinson and Thornton 5 212 220 1996 .

While the well ordered positions of IGF 1 were essentially identical using the two sets of phases the more flexible regions of the molecule showed dramatically improved connectivity upon inclusion of the sulfurs in the phasing. Experimental electron density maps showing the turn region of IGF 1 immediately following the first helix residues 19 20 and 21 indicate that using the combined Br and S phases resulted in a much more well connected map than using just the Br phases alone. At this point using the Br S phases about 50 of the molecule could be traced directly into the experimental maps.

After several cycles of model building and phase combination the final model shown in contains residues 3 34 and 41 64 of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 a single bound detergent molecule and 46 water molecules. The R factor to 1.8 is 23.7 and the free R factor is 26.9 with good stereochemistry. The N terminal B region corresponds to residues 3 28 the C region from 29 34 a stretch of poorly ordered residues from 35 40 and the A region from 42 62 of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 . The D region 63 70 is essentially disordered.

The structure of IGF 1 is similar to insulin see with a Root Mean Squared Deviation RMSD of 3 over backbone atoms that are conserved between the two molecules. Most of these deviations occur in the flexible regions and when only the helical regions are considered the RMSD between alpha carbon atoms is about 0.47 . The major difference is the extension of the C region for which there is no counterpart in mature insulin away from the body of the molecule. This loop contains many of the residues that are known to be important for receptor binding.

An extensive alanine scan mutagenesis study on IGF 1 has shown which residues are important for binding to IGFBP 1 and IGFBP 3 Dubaquie and Lowman supra . The residues that bind to IGFBP 3 are similar to those that bind IGFBP 1 although IGFBP 3 is believed to depend more on backbone interactions and is less severely affected by alanine mutations. There is no one dramatic spot where residues important for IGFBP 1 and IGFBP 3 binding are clustered and mutations that impair binding are scattered all over the molecule. There appears to be a slight clustering of sites at the N terminus with many of these sites being intrinsically hydrophobic.

As shown in the detergent molecule binds into a small hydrophobic cleft at the base of the B helix. There are several direct side chain contacts to the detergent from residues 5 7 and 10. Despite the overlap of the detergent binding site with a portion of the IGFBP 1 IGFBP 3 binding epitope the preliminary results suggest without being limited to any one theory that the detergent does not inhibit binding of these proteins to IGF 1. The opposite face of the detergent is making a symmetry contact to the opposite face of IGF 1.

As shown in there is only one large crystal packing contact between symmetry related IGF 1 molecules which results in a symmetric homodimer. The buried surface area is 1378 which is in the range of physiologically relevant protein protein interfaces.

IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 is composed primarily of three helical segments corresponding to the B helix IGF 1 residues 7 18 and two A helices IGF 1 residues 4347 and 54 58 of insulin. The hydrophobic core is essentially identical to that described for the NMR structures of IGF 1 including the three disulfide linkages between Cys 6 and Cys 48 Cys 18 and Cys 61 and Cys 47 and Cys 52 as noted in the references above. Residues 3 through 6 do not form any regular secondary structure and hence the structure described herein can be classified as being most similar to the T form of insulin Derewenda et al. 338 594 596 1989 . Indeed when IGF 1 and the T form of insulin are superimposed on the C positions of their respective helical segments IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 residues 8 19 4249 and 54 61 insulin SEQ ID NO 3 residues B9 B20 A1 A8 and A13 A20 the RMSD is only 0.47 angstroms. As in insulin residues 18 21 at the end of the B helix form a type II turn which redirects the backbone from the B helix into an extended region. Residues 24 27 form a type VIII turn to accommodate the C region which extends away from the core of IGF 1 and interacts with a symmetry related molecule. Residues 30 33 form a well defined type II beta turn prominently displaying Tyr 31 at the i 1 position. Residues 35 40 have not been modeled as the electron density in this region is weak and disconnected. Only the first two residues of the D region residues 63 and 64 are ordered in the structure.

The C region of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 mediates a two fold symmetric crystal packing interaction across the a axis of the unit cell. This interaction buries 689 of solvent accessible surface area from each molecule of IGF 1 or 1378 total and is the largest interface in the crystal. A total of 28 intermolecular contacts of distance 3.6 or less are formed via this interface with the next most extensive crystal packing interaction forming only nine contacts. The core of the interface is dominated by Tyr24 and Pro28 from each monomer which bury 39 and 57 of solvent accessible surface area respectively. The aromatic ring of Tyr 31 which lies at the tip of the loop at the furthest point from the core of IGF 1 packs against the phenolic rings of Phe 23 and Phe 25 of the symmetry related molecule. In addition to these hydrophobic interactions two main chain hydrogen bonds Tyr 31 N Phe 23 O and Ser 34 N Asp 20 O of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 are present in the dimer interface. Residues from the D region 62 64 are also partially sequestered by this dimer formation. Because of these interactions most of the C region in the crystal is well ordered providing the first high resolution view of the conformation of this biologically important loop.

Although 72 detergent compounds including the similar 3 3 cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio 1 propane sulphonate CHAPS and 3 3 cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio 2 hydroxypropanesulfonic acid CHAPSO detergents were screened in crystallization trials only N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine yielded crystals. A single molecule of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine interacts with residues forming a small hydrophobic cleft on one surface of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 Leu 5 Phe 16 Val 17 Leu 54 and Leu 57 . The preference for N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine is explained without being limited to any one theory by the absence of an oxygen atom at position C10 in the detergent molecule. This region of the detergent is in close contact with the side chain atoms of residues Leu 5 Leu 54 and Leu 57 in IGF 1. The opposite face of the detergent mediates a symmetry contact with residues Val 11 Leu 14 and Gln 15 of a symmetry related IGF 1 molecule. Intriguingly this face of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine also contacts the edge of the dimer interface with close contacts to Phe 23 and Phe 25 of the same IGF 1 molecule as well as Tyr 31 and Gly 32 of the dimeric partner . A more detailed analysis indicates that the detergent binds to two patches of binding pockets of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 . One patch has the amino acid residues Glu 3 Thr4 Leu 5 Asp 12 Ala 13 Phe 16 Val 17 Cys 47 Ser 51 Cys 52 Asp 53 Leu 54 and Leu 57 and the second patch has the amino acid residues Val 11 Gln 15 Phe 23 Phe 25 Asn 26 Val 44 Phe 49 and Arg 55. Binding is defined by having at least one contact between each listed amino acid residue and the candidate agonist molecule that is less than or equal to 6 angstroms.

The C region in the IGF 1 crystal structure extends out from the core of the molecule with residues 30 33 forming a canonical type II beta turn and the remainder of the C region forming a crystallographic dimer with a symmetry related molecule. Tyr 31 has been implicated as being a critical determinant for IGF 1R binding Bayne et al. Vol. 264 supra Bayne et al. Vol. 265 supra Cascieri et al. supra and its location at the tip of this extension places it in an ideal location to interact with a receptor molecule. While this region of IGF 1 is not well defined by NMR data the conformation of the C region in the crystal is likely to reflect a prevalent solution conformation. There is evidence of a reverse turn at the tip of the loop and a hinge bending at the loop termini of IGF 2 SEQ ID NO 2 Torres et al. supra . Thus while crystal packing forces undoubtedly help stabilize the orientation of this loop its conformation appears to be consistent with the solution structure of the closely related IGF 2.

The size of the interface formed by the crystallographic dimer is well within the range of buried surface area in known biological complexes Janin and Chothia 264 16027 16030 1990 . In addition this interaction partially excludes from solvent several of the residues known to be important for binding to the IGF 1R including Phe 23 69 buried Tyr 24 64 buried Phe 25 29 buried and Tyr 31 38 buried of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1. Other groups have also reported homodimeric interactions of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 and IGF 2 SEQ ID NO 2 . Laajoki et al. 2000 supra report that at a concentration of 1 mM an engineered form of IGF 1 Long Arg IGF 1 partitions into about 20 dimer 80 monomer a ratio that is in good agreement with the estimate of 3.6 mM K. In their NMR study of IGF 2 Torres et al. supra reported that the amide protons of residues in the C region were slowly exchanging with solvent suggesting that IGF 2 forms a homodimer in solution. However despite the significant amount of surface area that is buried upon dimer formation in the crystal the affinity of IGF 1 for itself is very weak. In addition the known binding stoichiometry of one IGF 1 molecule per receptor dimer De Meyts supra makes it difficult to rationalize the biological significance of IGF 1 dimerization. In conclusion the IGF 1 dimer in this crystal form results from the high concentration of IGF 1 in the crystallization experiment and does not represent a physiologically relevant form of the molecule. The very low quality of NMR spectroscopic data obtained for IGF 1 at near neutral pH has been attributed to a combination of self association and internal mobility that leads to a large variation in resonance line width Cooke et al. supra . As a result NOESY spectra acquired on IGF 1 contain many broad overlapped peaks and few sharp well resolved correlations. NOESY spectra collected for IGF 1 in the presence of an excess of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine have a similar appearance. Thus detergent binding is not sufficient to eliminate the aggregation or inherent flexibility of IGF 1 and does not facilitate characterization of the solution conformation of the protein. Likewise detergent binding does not alter the aggregation state of IGF 1 as assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation experiments in the presence of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine. This is in contrast to observations in the crystalline state where addition of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine leads to a well packed crystallographic dimer and crystals that diffract to high resolution. Jansson et al. 273 24701 24707 1998 noted that the lack of NMR assignments in the region immediately surrounding Cys 6 of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 which includes Leu 5 and Gly 7 was indicative of the Cys 6 Cys 48 disulfide undergoing intermediate exchange between a cis and trans configuration. The fact that the detergent binds to one face of the B helix immediately opposite this disulfide suggests without being limited to any one theory that it may serve to stabilize this region of the molecule by more complete packing of the hydrophobic cleft. Indeed in the crystal structure herein the Cys 6 Cys 48 is clearly in the trans conformation and there is no evidence of multiple conformations.

The crystal structure of IGF 1 has been determined using anomalous scattering from the intrinsic sulfur atoms and a Br ion bound at a fortuitous halide binding site. The structure is very similar to insulin with the only major difference being the C region which protrudes from the body of the protein and mediates a homodimeric interaction. The amount of buried surface area is consistent with the fact that at neutral pH IGF 1 undergoes self association in a concentration dependent manner. In addition several residues that are important for receptor binding are found at this dimer interface suggesting without being limited to any one theory that effects on receptor binding by mutation of these residues may be a result of disruption of the dimer rather than direct contact with the receptor surface.

NMR derived diffusion measurements were used to estimate the Kfor the interaction between IGF 1 and N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine. Samples were prepared in 50 mM phosphate buffer in D0 pH 6.5 uncorrected meter reading and contained 1.0 mM N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine 0.5 mM IGF 1 0.5 mM N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine 0.25 mM IGF 1 0.25 mM N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine 0.125 mM IGF 1 or N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine only 1.0 0.5 or 0.25 mM . All spectra were acquired at 40 C. on a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer Bruker Analytik GmbH equipped with a 5 mm triple axis gradient triple resonance probe. Diffusion measurements were made with a bipolar pulse pair method with 5 ms 2 ms and 25 or 40 ms for N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine alone or N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine IGF 1 respectively Wu et al. 115 260 264 1995 . Spectra were collected with 128 to 1024 transients as the z gradient strength was increased from 0.009 to 0.45 T min 18 equal increments measurements were made at least twice on each sample. Spectra were processed and peak heights extracted with the program FELIX v98.0 MSI San Diego . Diffusion constants proportion of bound detergent and resulting Kwere extracted as described by Fejzo et al. 6 755 769 1999 . Spectra were also collected on samples containing 1.0 mM 3 3 cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio 1 propane sulphonate a zwitterionic detergent used for membrane solubilization and 1.0 mM 3 3 cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio 1 propane sulphonate 0.5 mM IGF 1. Two dimensional NOESY spectra Jeener et al. 71 4546 4553 1979 were collected on a 0.5 mM sample of IGF 1 in the presence or absence of 1.0 mM N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine with a mixing time of 100 ms.

The self association of IGF 1 was determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis. The experiments were conducted at 20 C. in an OPTIMA XL A XL 1 analytical ultracentrifuge Beckman Coulter Inc. . The samples were prepared in 0.1 M citrate buffer pH 6.5 75 mM NaCl with a loading concentration from 1 mM to 0.01 mM. The concentration gradients were measured at rotor speeds of 25000 and 30000 rpm at 280 nm or 285 nm using a scanning absorption optical system. The attainment of an equilibrium state was verified by comparing successive scans after approximately 16 hours. The partial specific volume of IGF 1 was calculated from its amino acid composition. The data were fit as a single ideal species or the ideal dimer self association models using a non linear least squares fitting program NONLIN Johnson et al. 36 578 588 1981 . The association constants were determined from the best fit values of the model returned by non linear least squares regression.

The affinity of IGF 1 for 3 3 cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio 1 propane sulphonate and N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine was ascertained using solution NMR methods. The chemical shift changes observed during a titration of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine into a 0.5 mM IGF 1 solution suggested that the affinity was submillimolar and not easily measurable from such data. Instead diffusion measurements were made on samples at varying IGF 1 concentrations containing 2 molar equivalents of detergent and also on several samples of detergent alone the detergent concentration was always less than the critical micelle concentration of 1.4 mM for N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine and 14 mM for 3 3 cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio 1 propane sulphonate . The decrease in diffusion constant of the detergent in the presence of the protein can be used to estimate the proportion of detergent bound to the protein Fejzo et al. supra . Since the total concentration of detergent and protein is known a value of the dissociation constant can be determined. At the three protein concentrations studied 0.5 mM 0.25 mM and 0.125 mM Kvalues of 220 440 and 430 M were obtained respectively. This technique has routinely been applied to small molecules several hundred Daltons molecular weight or less binding to large proteins. In this particular case the ligand is relatively large 862 Da and the protein is relatively small 7648 Da hence the differential decrease in diffusion constant on binding is small. This increases the uncertainty with which the dissociation constant can be measured. Given this the data described above suggest that the Kfor the interaction between N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine and IGF 1 is 300 150 M. A similar analysis of the 3 3 cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio 1 propane sulphonate diffusion data suggests that that Kin this case is greater than 3 mM.

To examine the binding epitope of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine on IGF 1 the detergent was preincubated with IGF 1 expressed on bacteriophage particles and the level of residual binding to IGFBP 1 and IGFBP 3 was measured in a plate based assay ELISA . As a control soluble IGFBP 1 was also tested. As shown in N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine inhibited IGF 1 on phage from binding to IGFBP 1 and IGFBP 3 with ICvalues of 480 170 M and 275 152 M respectively. These numbers must be interpreted conservatively however since the critical micelle concentration of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine 1.4 mM presents an upper limit on the curve in . In contrast to the effect of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine the closely related detergent 3 3 cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio 1 propane sulphonate did not show any inhibition of binding at any of the concentrations tested up to 1 mM. Despite the limitations of the experiment the ICvalues obtained for N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine are in good agreement with the NMR based estimate of a Kof 300 M for the N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine IGF 1 interaction.

The sedimentation equilibrium data show that IGF 1 undergoes self association in solution. The average molecular weight increased with increasing protein concentration from 0.01 mM to 1 mM. The average molecular weight at the highest concentration studied 1 mM is about 37 higher than the monomer molecular weight 10.4 KDa at 1 mM versus 7.6 KDa monomer molecular weight . At concentrations below 0.05 mM no self association was observed and IGF 1 exists only as a monomer in solution at neutral pH. If it is assumed that the higher molecular weight species are IGF 1 dimers the sedimentation data can be fit as a monomer dimer model with a Kof 3.6 1.0 mM .

Several studies have identified residues in IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 that are important for IGFBP binding Clemmons et al. 131 890 895 1992 Dubaquie and Lowman supra Jansson et al. supra Oh et al. 1993 supra Lowman et al. 1998 supra and Dubaquie et al. 142 165 173 2001 . Dubaquie and Lowman supra identified two distinct patches on IGF 1 that interact with IGFBP 1 and IGFBP 3. Patch 1 consists of Glu 7 Leu 10 Val 11 Leu 14 Phe 25 Ile 43 and Val 44 while patch 2 consists of Glu 3 Thr 4 Leu 5 Phe 16 Val 17 and Leu 54. In the crystal structure of IGF 1 these two patches are involved in detergent mediated crystal packing contacts. Specifically Patch 1 of the crystal structure of IGF 1 consists of amino acid residues Glu 3 Thr 4 Leu 5 Asp 12 Ala 13 Phe 16 Val 17 Cys 47 Ser 51 Cys 52 Asp 53 Leu 54 and Leu 57 and Patch 2 of the crystal structure of IGF 1 consists of amino acid residues Val 11 Gln 15 Phe 23 Phe 25 Asn 26 Val 44 Phe 49 and Arg 55 wherein binding occurs if there is at least one contact between each listed amino acid residue and the candidate agonist molecule that is less than or equal to 6 angstroms. 

The overlap of the detergent binding site with the IGFBP interaction surfaces is entirely consistent with the observation herein that N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine blocks IGFBP 1 and IGFBP 3 binding. In contrast N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine does not inhibit IGF 1R mediated signaling in a cell based receptor activation assay. These results are consistent with prior studies that demonstrated different binding epitopes on IGF 1 for receptor and IGFBP interactions Bayne et al. supra Vol. 264 Bayne et al. supra Vol. 265 Cascieri et al. supra . The identification of N N bis 3 D gluconamidopropyl deoxycholamine as an inhibitor of IGFBP interactions allows the ability to develop small molecule drugs or peptidomimetics that disrupt the IGF 1 IGFBP complex in vivo thereby releasing receptor active IGF 1 from the systemic inactive pool. Such drugs include orally bioavailable therapy for metabolic disease such as diabetes.

Recently Zeslawski et al. 20 3638 3644 2001 published the crystal structure of IGF 1 in complex with the N terminal domain of IGFBP 5. The structure of that complex is entirely consistent with the model of detergent inhibition of IGFBP binding presented herein and also disclosed by Vajdos et al. 40 11022 11029 2001 . The NMR determination of a complex of IGF 1 bound to a phage derived IGF 1 antagonist peptide designated IGF F1 1 RNCFESVAALRRCMYG SEQ ID NO 4 in comparison with other IGF 1 crystal structures shows that without limitation to any one theory a portion of the A chain helix III is mobile in solution and adopts slightly different conformations when bound to different ligands detergent peptide binding protein .

The complex between peptide IGF F1 1 and IGF 1 was determined from NMR spectroscopy data collected at 600 and 800 MHz. IGF 1 uniformly labeled with C and N was prepared using the scheme outlined by Reilly and Fairbrother 4 459 462 1994 and purified according to the protocol in Vajdos et al. supra. A slight molar excess of unlabeled IGF F1 1 was mixed with a 1.5 mM solution of C N IGF 1 and H C and N NMR resonances assigned from double and triple resonance NMR experiments as described by Cavanagh et al. in Academic Press New York 1996 . Distance restraints within IGF 1 were identified from C edited NOESY HSQC spectra and N edited NOESY HSQC spectra Cavanagh et al. supra .

Intermolecular restraints between IGF 1 and the peptide were obtained from an 1 filtered 2 edited C HSQC NOESY spectrum Lee et al. 350 87 90 1994 . Intrapeptide distance restraints were obtained from a 2 D C filtered NOESY spectrum. In addition dihedral angle restraints were obtained from an HNHA spectrum Cavanagh et al. supra and 1 restraints were derived from HNHB and short mixing time TOCSY spectra Clore et al. 1 13 22 1991 . Additional restraints were obtained from an analysis of the H N C C and CO chemical shifts using the program TALOS Cornilescu et al. 13 289 302 1999 .

In total 899 distance restraints 779 intra IGF 1 33 intra peptide 87 intermolecular 16 hydrogen bond restraints in helix 1 and 138 dihedral angle restraints 71 44 23 1 were used to generate an ensemble of structures using a torsion angle dynamics protocol with the computer program CNX Accelrys Inc. San Diego . The structure of IGF 1 SEQ ID NO 1 was well defined for the B region residues 2 25 and the A region residues 41 63 with a mean RMSD from the mean structure for backbone heavy atoms of 0.32 0.06 . The C region 26 40 and the D region 62 70 were not well defined by the available data. The 20 structures of lowest restraint violation energy had good backbone stereochemistry 80 of residues in the most favored region of space with none in disallowed regions and contained few violations of the experimental restraints mean maximum distance restraint violation 0.09 0.02 . IGF F1 1 adopts a conformation very similar to that determined for the peptide by itself in solution. The conformation of IGF 1 contains three helices residues 7 18 43 49 and 54 60 and is similar to that seen at lower resolution in previous NMR studies of uncomplexed IGF 1 see e.g. Cooke et al. supra Sato et al. supra and Laajoki et al. supra .
