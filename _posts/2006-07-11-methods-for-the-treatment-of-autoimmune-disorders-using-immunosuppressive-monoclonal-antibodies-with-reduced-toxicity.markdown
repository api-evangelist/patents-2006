title: Methods for the treatment of autoimmune disorders using immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies with reduced toxicity
abstract: The present invention provides methods of treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of T cell-mediated immunological diseases, particularly autoimmune diseases, through the use of anti-CD3 antibodies. In particular, the methods of the invention provide for administration of antibodies that specifically bind the epsilon subunit within the human CD3 complex. Such antibodies modulate the T cell receptor/alloantigen interaction and, thus, regulate the T cell mediated cytotoxicity associated with autoimmune disorders. Additionally, the invention provides for modification of the anti-CD3 antibodies such that they exhibit reduced or eliminated effector function and T cell activation as compared to non-modified anti-CD3 antibodies.

The present invention provides methods of treating preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of T cell mediated immunological diseases particularly autoimmune diseases through the use of anti CD3 antibodies. In particular the methods of the invention provide for administration of antibodies that specifically bind the epsilon subunit within the human CD3 complex. Such antibodies modulate the T cell receptor alloantigen interaction and thus regulate the T cell mediated cytotoxicity associated with autoimmune disorders. Additionally the invention provides for modification of the anti CD3 antibodies such that they exhibit reduced or eliminated effector function and T cell activation as compared to non modified anti CD3 antibodies.

Autoimmune diseases are caused when the body s immune system which normally defends the body against bacteria viruses and other infective agents attacks self tissue cells and organs. The mobilization of the immune system against such self targets is termed autoimmunity. Although some autoimmunity is present in every individual rigid control systems suppress the self recognizing cells of the immune system to an extent that the autoimmunity is normally asymptomatic. Disease states arise when there is some interruption in the control system allowing the autoimmune cells to escape suppression or when there is some change in a target tissue such that it is no longer recognized as self. The mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood but have been theorized to be the result of aberrant immune stimulation in genetically predisposed individuals.

Autoimmune diseases can be organ specific or systemic and are provoked by differing pathogenic mechanisms. Organ specific autoimmunization is characterized by tolerance and suppression within the T cell compartment aberrant expression of major histocompatibility complex MHC antigens antigenic mimicry and allelic variations in MHC genes. Systemic autoimmune diseases involve polyclonal B cell activation and abnormalities of immunoregulatory T cells T cell receptors and MHC genes. Examples of organ specific autoimmune diseases are diabetes cutaneous psoriasis ulcerative colitis hyperthyroidism autoimmune adrenal insufficiency hemolytic anemia multiple sclerosis and rheumatic carditis. Representative systemic autoimmune diseases are systemic lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis Sjogren s syndrome polymyositis dermatomyositis and scleroderma.

Also while not an autoimmune disorder organ transplant recipients often experience similar symptoms and require therapies similar to autoimmune patients. Immune system attacks on the transplanted organs can lead to organ failure or more serious systemic complications i.e. bone marrow transplant recipients and graft vs. host disease GVHD .

There is a clear need for improved strategies to treat autoimmune disorders and or modulate immune response. Currently immune system disorders are treated with immunosuppressive agents such as cortisone aspirin derivatives hydroxychloroquine methotrexate azathioprine cyclophsophamide and various biologics such as anti TNF antibodies or combinations thereof. The treatments are varyingly successful depending on the individual patient and disorder. However a dilemma in the use of such general immunosuppressive therapies arises in that the greater the immune suppression and thus the potential for successful treatment of the autoimmune disorder the more at risk the patient becomes for developing opportunistic infections. Further due to the compromised nature of the patient s immune system even a minor infection can rapidly become of serious concern.

One of the most common autoimmune diseases is type 1 diabetes also known as juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. It affects 15 million people in the United States with an estimated additional 12 million people who are currently asymptomatic and thus are unaware that they have this disease. Diabetes is caused by an autoimmune response in which the insulin producing cells of the pancreas also known as islet cells are gradually destroyed. The early stage of the disease termed insulitis is characterized by infiltration of leukocytes into the pancreas and is associated with both pancreatic inflammation and the release of anti cell cytotoxic antibodies. As the disease progresses the injured tissue may also attract lymphocytes causing yet further damage to the cells. Also subsequent general activation of lymphocytes for example in response to viral infection food allergy chemical or stress may result in yet more islet cells being destroyed. Early stages of the disease are often overlooked or misdiagnosed as clinical symptoms of diabetes typically manifest only after about 80 of the cells have been destroyed. Once symptoms occur the type 1 diabetic is normally insulin dependent for life. The dysregulation of blood glucose levels associated with diabetes can lead to blindness kidney failure nerve damage and is a major contributing factor in the etiology of stroke coronary heart disease and other blood vessel disorders.

Destruction of cells in diabetes or of the target cells of other autoimmune disorders is believed largely mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs also known as CD8 T cells that specifically recognize antigenic target cell derived peptides. CTLs as well as other types of T cells recognize these antigenic peptides through their specific T cell receptor TcR . Unlike antibodies which recognize soluble whole foreign proteins as antigen the TcR instead interacts with small peptidic antigens presented only in complex with major histocompatibility complex MHC proteins.

Most cells of the body express MHC molecules of various classes on their surface and depending on the class of MHC expressed will present either soluble antigens those dispersed within the lymph and or circulatory systems or fragments of their cytoplasmic proteins. MHC molecules called human leukocyte antigens or HLA in humans and TcRs are extremely polymorphic each clonal variation recognizing and binding to a single peptidic sequence or set of similar peptidic analogs. Apart from cells specific to the immune system i.e. B cells and T cells cells of the body express multiple variants of the MHC molecule each variant binding to a different peptide sequence. In contrast during maturation B and T cells lose the ability to express multiple variants of MHC and TcR respectively. Mature T cells therefore will express only one of the possible variants of the TcR and will thus recognize bind a single MHC antigen complex.

Binding of a TcR to a MHC antigen complex releases an intracellular signal cascade within the T cell termed activation which results in clonal proliferation of the T cell and class specific T cell responses. For example in CTLs the response to activation also includes the release of cytotoxic enzymes that result in apoptosis destruction of the target cell.

The finding that autoimmune diseases are at least partially caused by aberrant T cell action has lead to the investigation of therapies that either eliminate problematic T cell clones those expressing TcRs against self antigens or selectively reduce undesired T cell activity activation. T cell activation due to TcR binding is however an unexpectedly complex phenomenon due to the participation of a variety of cell surface molecules expressed on the responding T cell population Billadeau et al. 2002 J. Clin. Invest. 109 161 168 Weiss 1990 J. Clin. Invest. 86 1015 1022 Leo et al. 1987 PNAS 84 1374 1378 Weiss et al. 1984 PNAS 81 4169 4173 Hoffman et al. 1985 J. Immunol. 135 5 8 .

Targeted therapies directed against general T cell activation were problematic in that the TcR is composed of a disulfide linked heterodimer containing two clonally distributed integral membrane glycoprotein chains and or and . Most of the research in modulation of T cell activation was done in connection with improving immune suppression in organ transplant recipients. One of the first clinically successful methods of selectively reducing T cell activation was the use of monoclonal antibodies. U.S. Pat. No. 4 658 019 describes a novel hybridoma designated OKT3 ATCC Accession No. CRL 8001 which is capable of producing a murine monoclonal antibody against an antigen found on essentially all normal human peripheral T cells. Binding of OKT3 to T cells in vivo produces pronounced reversible immunosuppression. OKT3 was found to recognize an epitope on the subunit within the human CD3 complex Salmeron et al. 1991 J. Immunol. 147 3047 3052 Transy et al. 1989 Eur. J. Immunol. 19 947 950 see also U.S. Pat. No. 4 658 019 . The CD3 complex also known as T3 is comprised of low molecular weight invariant proteins which non covalently associate with the TcR Samelson et al. 1985 Cell 43 223 231 . The CD3 structures are thought to represent accessory molecules that may be the transducing elements of activation signals initiated upon binding of the TcR to its ligand.

OKT3 possesses potent T cell activating and suppressive properties Landgren 1982 Van Seventer 1987 Weiss 1986 . Fc receptor mediated cross linking of TcR bound anti CD3 mAb results in T cell activation marker expression and proliferation Weiss et al. 1986 Ann. Rev. Immunol. 4 593 . Similarly in vivo administration of OKT3 results in both T cell activation and suppression of immune responses Ellenhom et al. 1992 Transplantation Chatenoud 1990 Transplantation 49 697 . Repeated daily administration of OKT3 results in profound immunosuppression and provides effective treatment of rejection following renal transplantation Thistlethwaite 1984 Transplantation 38 695 .

The use of therapeutic mAbs including for example OKT3 is limited by problems of first dose side effects ranging from mild flu like symptoms to severe toxicity. The first dose side effects are believed to be caused by cytokine production stimulated by T cell activation. It has been shown that the activating properties of mAbs result from TcR cross linking mediated by the mAb bound to T cells via its F ab portion and to Fc R bearing cells via its Fc portion Palacios et al. 1985 Eur. J. Immunol. 15 645 651 Ceuppens et al. 1985 J. Immunol. 134 1498 1502 Kan et al. 1986 Cell Immunol. 98 181 185 . For example the use of OKT3 was found to trigger activation of mAb bound T cells and Fc R bearing cells prior to achieving immune suppression resulting in a massive systemic release of cytokines Abramowicz 1989 Transplantation 47 P606 Chatenoud 1989 . Reported side effects of OKT3 therapy include flu like symptoms respiratory distress neurological symptoms and acute tubular necrosis that may follow the first and sometimes the second injection of the mAb Abramowicz 1989 Chatenoud 1989 Toussaint 1989 Transplantation 48 524 Thistlethwaite 1988 Am. J. Kid. Dis. 11 112 Goldman 1990 Transplantation 50 148 .

Data obtained using experimental models in chimpanzees and mice have suggested that preventing or neutralizing the cellular activation induced by anti CD3 mAbs reduces the toxicity of these agents Parleviet 1990 Transplantation 50 889 Rao 1991 Transplantion 52 691 Alegre Eur.

In addition previous results reported in mice using F ab fragments of 145 2C11 a hamster anti mouse CD3 have suggested that in the absence of Fc R binding and cellular activation anti CD3 mAbs retain at least some immunosuppressive properties in vivo Hirsch Transplant Proc. 1991 23 270 Hirsch J.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 491 916 U.S. Pat. application Pub. No. 2005 0064514 and U.S. Pat. application Pub. No. 2005 0037000 describe the modification of the Fc regions of immunoglobulins such that the variant molecules exhibit enhanced or reduced binding to various Fc receptors when compared to immunoglobulins with wild type Fc domains. In particular the patents applications describe modifications to the Fc regions of IgG antibodies such that the affinity for the Fc R is selectively enhanced or reduced. By tailoring the affinity for activating or suppressive Fc receptors the specific immune response elicited by the therapeutic mAb may be more selectively controlled. For example mutations in the CHportion of a humanized OKT3 IgG4 have been identified P234A and L235A that significantly reduced binding of the mAb to human and murine Fc RI and II and lead to a markedly reduced activating phenotype in vitro Alegre et al. 1992 8International Congress of Immunology 23 28 Alegre et al. 1994 Transplantation 57 1537 1543 Xu et al. 2000 Cell Immunol. 200 16 26 . Importantly this variant mAb retained the capacity to induce TcR modulation and immunosupression Xu et al. 2000 .

To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes e.g. gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence . The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences i.e. identity number of identical overlapping positions total number of positions 100 . In one embodiment the two sequences are the same length.

The determination of percent identity between two sequences can also be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. A preferred non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87 2264 2268 modified as in Karlin and Altschul 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90 5873 5877 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. 1990 J. Mol. Biol. 215 403. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST nucleotide program parameters set e.g. for score 100 wordlength 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program parameters set e.g. to score 50 wordlength 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the present invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. 1997 Nucleic Acids Res. 25 3389 3402. Alternatively PSI BLAST can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules Id. . When utilizing BLAST Gapped BLAST and PSI Blast programs the default parameters of the respective programs e.g. of XBLAST and NBLAST can be used see e.g. the NCBI website . Another preferred non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller 1988 CABIOS 4 11 17 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Such an algorithm is incorporated in the ALIGN program version 2.0 which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences a PAM120 weight residue table a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.

The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity typically only exact matches are counted.

The present invention provides for monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD3 complex associated with the human TcR and methods of administration and or use thereof for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. In particular embodiments the antibody binds to the epsilon subunit of the CD3 complex. The methods of the invention may be used with any anti CD3 antibody presented herein or known in the art e.g. OKT3 ChAglyCD3 TRX4 HUM291 visilizumab Nuvion UCHT1 Leu4 500A2 CLB T3 3 BMA030 BH11 T2 30 AG3 BC3 SP34 RIV 9 UCHT1 64.1 M291 and YTH 12.5 and variations or derivatives thereof. In one embodiment of the invention the antibody is OKT3 preferably humanized versions of OKT3 or an antibody that competes for binding with OKT3. In another embodiment the antibody is humanized OKT3 which has been modified at one or more amino acid residues as described herein to exhibit reduced T cell activation and or FcR binding when compared to a non modified humanized OKT3 antibody.

Anti CD3 mAbs are potent immunosuppressive agents directed against an invariant protein complex associated with the human TCR Van Wauwe 1980 J. Immunol. 124 2708 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . The CD3 complexes are believed to be accessory structures that transduce the activation signals initiated upon binding of the TcR to its ligand. Binding of the anti CD3 antibody OKT3 to the TcR mediates TcR blockade and inhibits alloantigen recognition and cell mediated cytotoxicity Landegren et al. 1982 J. Exp. Med. 155 1579 van Seventer et al. 1987 J. Immunol. 139 2545 Weiss et al. 1986 Ann. Rev. Immunol. 4 593 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . However the administration of some immune cell directed mAbs including OKT3 may induce T cell activation including the systematic release of several cytokines including IL 2 IL 6 TNF and IFN Abramowicz 1989 Chatenoud 1989 . This production of cytokines has been correlated with the adverse side effects frequently observed after the first injection of mAbs Van Wauwe 1980 Chatenoud 1989 Thistlethwaite 1988 and may augment the production of anti isotopic and anti idiotypic antibodies occurring in some patents after one or two weeks of treatment. This immune response can neutralize the specific mAb as well as other antibodies of the same class isotype and preclude subsequent treatments Thistlethwaite 1988 .

Several pieces of evidence strongly suggest that these side effects are a consequence of the cross linking between T lymphocytes and Fc receptor FcR bearing cells through the Fc portion of mAbs including for example OKT3 resulting in activation of both cell types Debets 1990 J. Immunol. 144 1304 Krutman 1990 J. Immunol. 145 1337 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety 1 anti CD3 mAbs did not stimulate T cell proliferation in vitro unless the Ab was immobilized to plastic or bound to FcR antigen presenting cells included in the culture van Lier 1989 Immunol. 68 45 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety 2 the cross linking of OKT3 through FcRs I and II enhanced proliferation in response to IL 2 in vitro van Lier 1987 J. Immunol. 139 2873 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety 3 proliferation of murine T cells induced by 145 2C11 a hamster mAb directed against the murine CD3 complex could be blocked by the anti FcR Ab 2.4G2 4 the injection into mice of F ab fragments of 145 2C11 induced significant immunosuppression without triggering full T cell activation Hirsch 1990 and was less toxic in mice than the whole mAb Alegre 1990 and 5 the administration of an OKT3 IgA switch variant that displayed a reduced FcR mediated T cell activation as compared with OKT3 IgG2a resulted in fewer side effects in chimpanzees in vivo Parleviet 1990 .

Administration of anti CD3 antibodies has also been associated with transient retrovirus activation specifically activation of dormant Epstein Barr Virus EBV infection. Anti CD3 antibody treatment has also been found to be lytic to activated T cells and apoptotic to some T cell populations. The reasons for these effects are unclear but they may be dose related and are probably the result of the modulation of the TcR complex resulting in suboptimal signaling.

Thus improvement of anti CD3 mAb therapy can be obtained by molecularly modifying the antibody to reduce its affinity for FcRs. The mutated Ab obtained could lead to lower cellular activation and reduced toxicity in vivo but retain the original immunosuppressive properties of the antibody.

The use of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is limited by problems of first dose side effects. First dose side effects range from mild flu like symptoms to severe toxicity can be mild to severe and include symptoms such as high fever chills rigors headache tremor nausea vomiting diarrhea abdominal pain malaise muscle joint aches and pains and generalized weakness. The first dose side effects are believed to be caused by lymphokine production and cytokine release stimulated by the Fc region of a MAb binding to and activating an Fc R on an Fc R containing cell.

The FcR recognizes immunoglobulins of one or more isotypes through a recognition domain on the a chain of the Fc receptor. Fc receptors are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin subtypes. For example Fc receptors for IgG are referred to as Fc R. Different accessory cells bear Fc receptors for antibodies of different isotype and the isotype of the antibody determines which accessory cells will be engaged in a given response reviewed by Ravetch J. V. et al. 1991 9 457 92 Gerber J. S. et al. 2001 3 131 139 Billadeau D. D. et al. 20022 109 161 1681 Ravetch J. V. et al. 2000290 84 89 Ravetch J. V. et al. 2001 19 275 90 Ravetch J. V. 199478 4 553 60 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . The different Fc receptors the cells that express them and their isotype specificity is summarized in Table 1 adapted from 4ed. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd Garland Publishing New York which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

The invention thus encompasses CD3 binding molecules that reduce or eliminate at least one symptom associated with first dose side effects and or minimize toxicity associated with administration of an antibody of the invention by reducing or eliminating binding of the Fc to one or more Fc R. Such CD3 binding proteins comprise a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications relative to a wild type Fc region wherein said Fc region may be derived from any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD IgA and IgY class e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgAand IgA or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The modification decreases or eliminates binding of the Fc to one or more Fc Rs relative to a comparable wild type Fc region. The modification is typically an amino acid substitution. However the modification can be an amino acid insertion and or deletion. Typically the modification occurs in the CH2 and or hinge region. Alternatively binding of Fc to one or more Fc Rs can be reduced or eliminated by altering or eliminating one or more glycosyl groups on one in more Fc regions. Fc glycosylation can be altered or eliminated by methods well know in the art. For example Fc glycosylation can be altered by producing the Fc in a cell that is deficient in fucosylation e.g. fuc6 null cells or eliminated by deglycosylation enzymes or an amino acid modification that alters or eliminates a glycosylation site e.g. the N X S T glycosylation site at positions 297 299 in the CH2 domain . Fc R binding can be measured using standard methods known in the art and exemplified herein. The antibodies of the invention are thus particularly useful because they have reduced or no in vivo toxicity caused by lymphokine production or cytokine release. The affinities and binding properties of the molecules of the invention for an FcR are initially determined using in vitro assays biochemical or immunological based assays known in the art for determining Fc FcR interactions i.e. specific binding of an Fc region to an FcR including but not limited to ELISA assay surface plasmon resonance assay immunoprecipitation assays See Section 5.4 . Preferably the binding properties of the molecules of the invention are also characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more Fc R mediator effector cell functions See Section 5.4 . In most preferred embodiments the molecules of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models such as those described and disclosed herein as those in in vitro based assays However the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo.

Each member of this family is an integral membrane glycoprotein possessing extracellular domains related to a C2 set of immunoglobulin related domains a single membrane spanning domain and an intracytoplasmic domain of variable length. There are three known Fc Rs designated Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 which exhibit extensive homology but are encoded by distinct genes. Both activating and inhibitory signals are transduced through the Fc Rs following ligation. These diametrically opposing functions result from structural differences among the different receptor isoforms. In general the binding of a complimentary Fc domain to Fc RI Fc RIIA and Fc RIIIA results in activation of downstream substrates e.g. PIK and leading to the release of proinflammatory mediators. In contrast the binding of a complimentary Fc domain to Fc RIIB results in phosphorylation of Fc RIIB and association with the SH2 domain of the inosital polyphosphate 5 phosphatase SHIP . SHIP hydrolyzes phosphoinositol messengers released as a consequence of Fc RI mediated tyrosine kinase activation consequently preventing the influx of intracellular Ca. Thus crosslinking of Fc RIIB dampens the activating response to Fc R ligation and inhibits cellular responsiveness.

Methods of measuring lymphokine production and cytokine release are known and routine in the art and encompassed herein. For example cytokine release may be measured by measuring secretion of cytokines including but not limited to TNF GM CSF IFN . See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 491 916 Isaacs et al. 2001 Rheumatology 40 724 738 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Lymphokine production may be measured by measuring secretion of lymphokines including but not limited to Interleukin 2 IL 2 Interleukin 4 IL 4 Interleukin 6 IL 6 Interleukin 12 IL 12 Interleukin 16 IL 16 PDGF TGF TGF TNF TNF GCSF GM CSF MCSF IFN IFN TFN IGF I IGF II.

As used herein the term Fc region is used to define a C terminal region of an IgG heavy chain. Although the boundaries may vary slightly the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is defined to stretch from Cys226 to the carboxy terminus. The Fc region of an IgG comprises two constant domains CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region also referred to as C 2 domain usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. The CH2 domain is unique in that it is not closely paired with another domain. Rather two N linked branched carbohydrate chains are interposed between the two CH2 domains of an intact native IgG.

In preferred embodiments the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region may be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD IgA and IgY class e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgAand IgA or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule and wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region which variant Fc region does not bind any Fc R as determined by standard assays known in the art and disclosed herein relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild type Fc region. In a specific embodiment the one or more amino acid modifications which abolish binding to all Fc Rs comprise a substitution at position 233 with phenylalanine or a substitution at position 238 with arginine or a substitution at position 265 with alanine or a substitution at position 265 with glutamic acid or a substitution at position 270 with alanine or a substitution at position 270 with asparagine or a substitution at position 297 with alanine or a substitution at position 297 with glutamine or a substitution at position 298 with phenylalanine or a substitution at position 298 with asparagine or a substitution at position 299 with any amino acid other than serine or threonine or a substitution at position 265 with alanine and at position 297 with alanine or a substitution at position 265 with alanine and at position 297 with glutamine or a substitution at position 265 with glutamic acid and at position 297 with alanine or a substitution at position 265 with glutamic acid and at position 297 with glutamine or a substitution at position 234 with alanine and at position 235 with alanine or a substitution at position 234 with alanine and at position 235 with glutamic acid. In another embodiment the one or more amino acid modifications which abolish binding to all Fc Rs comprise combinations of the modifications listed herein or combinations of the modifications listed herein with any that may confer null binding to CD32A CD32B and CD16A as determined by the methods disclosed herein or known to one skilled in the art.

To prolong the serum circulation of antibodies e.g. monoclonal antibodies single chain antibodies and Fab fragments in vivo for example inert polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol PEG can be attached to the antibodies with or without a multifluctional linker either through site specific conjugation of the PEG to the or C terminus of the antibodies or via epsilon amino groups present on lysine residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation can be closely monitored by SDS PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody PEG conjugates by size exclusion or by ion exchange chromatography. PEG derivatized antibodies can be tested for binding activity as well as for in vivo efficacy using methods well known to those of skill in the art for example by immunoassays described herein.

An antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof that immunospecifically binds to a CD3 polypeptide can be conjugated to a second antibody to form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that immunospecifically bind to a CD3 polypeptide may be attached to solid supports which are particularly useful for the purification of CD3 immune cells such as T cells.

The present invention is directed to therapies which involve administering CD3 binding molecules particularly anti CD3 antibodies to a subject preferably a human subject for preventing treating or ameliorating an autoimmune disorder or one or more symptoms thereof. In particular the present invention is directed to therapies which involve administering CD3 binding molecules particularly anti CD3 antibodies more particularly humanized forms of OKT3 that have Fc domains that do not bind to Fc receptors to a subject preferably a human subject for preventing treating or ameliorating one or more symptoms of diabetes.

Examples of autoimmune disorders that may be treated by administering the molecules of the present invention include but are not limited to alopecia areata ankylosing spondylitis antiphospholipid syndrome autoimmune Addison s disease autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis autoimmune thrombocytopenia Behcet s disease bullous pemphigoid cardiomyopathy celiac sprue dermatitis chronic fatigue immune dysftnction syndrome CFIDS chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Churg Strauss syndrome cicatrical pemphigoid CREST syndrome cold agglutinin disease Crohn s disease discoid lupus essential mixed cryoglobulinemia fibromyalgia fibromyositis glomerulonephritis Graves disease Guillain Barre Hashimoto s thyroiditis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura ITP irritable bowel disease IBD IgA neuropathy juvenile arthritis lichen planus lupus erthematosus Meniere s disease mixed connective tissue disease multiple sclerosis type 1 or immune mediated diabetes mellitus myasthenia gravis pemphigus vulgaris pernicious anemia polyarteritis nodosa polychrondritis polyglandular syndromes polymyalgia rheumatica polymyositis and dermatomyositis primary agammaglobulinemia primary biliary cirrhosis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis Raynauld s phenomenon Reiter s syndrome Rheumatoid arthritis sarcoidosis scleroderma Sj gren s syndrome stiff man syndrome systemic lupus erythematosus lupus erythematosus takayasu arteritis temporal arteristis giant cell arteritis ulcerative colitis uveitis vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis vitiligo and Wegener s granulomatosis. Some autoimmune disorders are also associated with an inflammatory condition. Thus there is overlap between what is considered an autoimmune disorder and an inflammatory disorder. Therefore some autoimmune disorders may also be characterized as inflammatory disorders. Examples of inflammatory disorders which can be prevented treated or managed in accordance with the methods of the invention include but are not limited to asthma encephilitis inflammatory bowel disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD allergic disorders pulmonary fibrosis undifferentitated spondyloarthropathy undifferentiated arthropathy arthritis inflammatory osteolysis and chronic inflammation resulting from chronic viral or bacteria infections. Examples of the types of psoriasis which can be treated in accordance with the compositions and methods of the invention include but are not limited to plaque psoriasis pustular psoriasis erythrodermic psoriasis guttate psoriasis and inverse psoriasis.

Type 1 diabetes or immune mediated diabetes mellitus is caused by an autoiimmune response in which the insulin producing cells of the pancreas are gradually destroyed. Destruction of the cells is believed largely mediated by CTLs CD8 T cells . The early stage of the disease termed insulitis is characterized by infiltration of leukocytes into the pancreas and is associated with both pancreatic inflammation and the release of anti cell cytotoxic antibodies. Early stages of the disease are often overlooked or misdiagnosed as clinical symptoms of diabetes typically manifest only after about 80 of the cells have been destroyed. Even with immunosuppressive therapy cell populations do not recover to a significant extent therefore once clinical symptoms occur the type 1 diabetic is normally insulin dependent for life. Insulin is currently the only standard therapy for treating symptoms of type 1 diabetes. Although immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate and cyclosporin showed early clinical promise in the treatment of type I diabetes e.g. maintenance of cell function as with all general immunosuppressants their prolonged use was associated with a number of severe side effects.

Use of the invention in the context of diabetes therefore encompasses methods to sustain protect the levels and functionality of cells which exist at the time of treatment. In a specific embodiment anti CD3 antibody therapy is not used for the treatment of acute diabetes but rather to prevent progression of the disease in recently diagnosed individuals including children diagnosed with juvenille diabetes See Herold et al. 2005 Diabetes 54 1763 1769 . In a specific embodiment anti CD3 therapy is used only in patients that have residual cell function as compared to an individual in the same population i.e age sex race and general health and determined by methods described herein or known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In another embodiment anti CD3 antibody therapy is used to maintain transplanted cell function in pancreatic transplant recipients.

 cell function prior to during and after therapy may be assessed by methods described herein or by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial DCCT research group has established the monitoring of percentage glycoslyated hemoglobin HA1 and HA1c as the standard for evaluation of blood glucose control DCCT 1993 N. Engl. J. Med. 329 977 986 . Alternatively characterization of daily insulin needs C peptide levels response hypoglycemic episodes and or FPIR may be used as markers of cell function or to establish a therapeutic index See Keymeulen et al. 2005 N. Engl. J. Med. 352 2598 2608 Herold et al. 2005 Diabetes 54 1763 1769 U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2004 0038867 A1 and Greenbaum et al. 2001 Diabetes 50 470 476 respectively . For example FPIR is calculated as the sum of insulin values at 1 and 3 minutes post IGTT which are performed according to Islet Cell Antibody Register User s Study protocols see e.g. Bingley et al. 1996 Diabetes 45 1720 1728 and McCulloch et al. 1993 Diabetes Care 16 911 915 each of said references being hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory hyperproliferative skin disease that affects approximately 1 2 of the general population with men and women affected in equal numbers. Nevitt G. J. et al. 1996 British J. of Dermatology 135 533 537 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Approximately 150 000 new cases of psoriasis and approximately 400 deaths from psoriasis are reported each year Stern R. S. 1995 Dermatol. Clin. 13 717 722 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . The most common type of psoriasis is chronic plaque syndrome. The condition is chronic for many sufferers and consists of periods of remission and relapse during the course of the disease Ashcroft D. M. et al. 2000 J. of Clin. Pharm. And Therap. 25 1 10 .

Psoriasis is characterized by indurated erythematous scaling plaques most commonly located on the scalp or the extensor aspects of the elbows and knees but may occur at any skin site. Present treatment options currently available for psoriasis include topical agents phototherapy and systemic agents. Topical treatments are first line therapy for patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. Systemic treatment is generally prescribed for severe cases of psoriasis where topical therapy is either impractical or ineffective. Phototherapy can be administered either alone or in combination with either topical or systemic agents. Unfortunately each of these treatment options is associated with severe side effects. Most of the topical agents available for the treatment of psoriasis are associated with skin irritation toxicity and possible carcinogenicity Ashcroft D. M. et al. 2000 J. of Clin. Pharm. and Therap. 25 1 10 . Phototherapy either broadband UVB or long wave UVA is associated with short term risks such as vesiculation nausea erythema headache and skin pain as well as long term risks of actinic keratoses premature ageing of the skin irregular pigmentation and squamous cell carcinoma which is reported in a quarter of patients Stern R. S. 1994 Cancer 73 2759 2764 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Systemic agents are also associated with adverse side effects and most are unavailable to pregnant patients. In particular methotrexate which is considered to be the gold standard for treatment of severe psoriasis carries a risk of hepatotoxicity with long term use. In addition it is recommended that patients have a liner biopsy performed at or near the start of each treatment and after each cumulative dose of 1.0 1.5 mg MTX Roenigk H. H. et al. 1988 J. of the Am. Acad. Of Dermatology which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

When patients are provided with information regarding the possible adverse effects of the currently available therapies for psoriasis many often choose to live with the condition rather than undergo treatment Greaves M. W. 1995 New England J. of Medicine 332 581 588 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Thus there remains a need for better methods of treating psoriasis than currently available therapies.

Use of the invention in the context of psoriasis therefore encompasses methods to treat the acute phases of the disease as well as to prevent recurrence of symptoms of psoriasis. The response to anti CD3 therapy in the context of psoriasis may be assessed by methods described herein or by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Common methods used to monitor the sysmtoms of psoraisis include but are not limited to the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index PASI Physician Global Assessment PGA and NPF Psoriasis Score NPF PS See Ashcroft et al. 1999 Br. J. Dermatol. 141 185 191 van der Kerkhof et al. 1997 Br. J.

Rheumatoid arthritis RA is an autoimmune disorder where the body s immune system improperly identifies the synovial membranes that secrete the lubricating fluid in the joints as foreign. Inflammation results and the cartilage and tissues in and around the joints are damaged or destroyed. In severe cases this inflammation extends to other joint tissues and surrounding cartilage where it may erode or destroy bone and cartilage and lead to joint deformities. The body replaces damaged tissue with scar tissue causing the normal spaces within the joints to become narrow and the bones to fuse together. Rheumatoid arthritis creates stiffness swelling fatigue anemia weight loss fever and often crippling pain. Some common symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis include joint stiffness upon awakening that lasts an hour or longer swelling in a specific finger or wrist joints swelling in the soft tissue around the joints and swelling on both sides of the joint. Swelling can occur with or without pain and can worsen progressively or remain the same for years before progressing. Besides rheumatoid arthritis other types of arthritis associated with autoimmune inflammation include the following psoriatic arthritis Reiter s syndrome and ankylosing spondylitis arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs in joints on both sides of the body such as both hands wrists or knees . This symmetry helps distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from other types of arthritis. In addition to affecting the joints rheumatoid arthritis may occasionally affect the skin eyes lungs heart blood or nerves.

Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1 of the world s population and is potentially disabling. There are approximately 2.9 million incidences of rheumatoid arthritis in the United States. Two to three times more women are affected than men. The typical age that rheumatoid arthritis occurs is between 25 and 50. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis affects 71 000 young Americans aged eighteen and under affecting six times as many girls as boys.

Currently available therapy for arthritis focuses on reducing inflammation of the joints with anti inflammatory or immunosuppressive medications. The first line of treatment of any arthritis is usually anti inflammatories such as aspirin ibuprofen and Cox 2 inhibitors such as celecoxib and rofecoxib. Second line drugs include gold methotrexate and steroids. Although these are well established treatments for arthritis very few patients remit on these lines of treatment alone. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis have led to the use of methotrexate in combination with antibodies to cytokines or recombinant soluble receptors. However only about 50 of the patients treated with a combination of methotrexate and anti TNF agents such as recombinant soluble receptors for TNF show clinically significant improvement. Many patients remain refractory despite treatment. Difficult treatment issues still remain for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Many current treatments have a high incidence of side effects or cannot completely prevent disease progression.

Use of the invention in the context of RA therefore excompasses methods to treat the acute phases of the disease as well as to prevent recurrence of symptoms of RA. The response to the therapeutic methods of the invention in the context of RA may be assessed by methods described herein or by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example many but not all people with rheumatoid arthritis have rheumatoid factor antibody in their blood however the presence of rheumatoid factor is not in itself definitive for a positive diagnosis of RA as other conditions are know which cause the rheumatoid factor to be produced. Therefore the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis is most commonly based on a combination of factors including but not limited to the specific location and symmetry of painful joints the presence of joint stiffness in the morning the presence of bumps and nodules under the skin rheumatoid nodules results of X ray tests that suggest rheumatoid arthritis.

Tissue transplantation between genetically nonidentical individuals results in immunological rejection of the tissue through T cell dependent mechanisms. To prevent allograft rejection immunosuppression is achieved with agents that generally interfere with T cell function by modulating TcR signal transduction see e.g. Borel J. F. 1989 Pharmacol. Rev. 42 260 372 Morris P. J. 1991 Curr. Opin. Immunol. 3 748 751 Sigal et al. 1992 Ann. Rev. Immunol. 10 519 560 and L Azou et al. 1999 Arch. Toxicol. 73 337 345 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Further since the effect of the immunosuppressive agents is short lasting transplant recipients normally require life long treatment of immunosuppressive agents to prevent transplant rejection. Transplant recipients receiving long term immunosuppressive treatment have a high risk of developing infections and tumors. For example patients receiving immunotherapy are at higher risk of developing lymphomas skin tumors and brain tumors see e.g. Fellstrom et al. 1993 Immunol. Rev. 134 83 98 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . As an alternative to the general immunosuppressive agents currently used for the prevention of allograft rejection monoclonal antibodies including OKT3 have been successfully used to specifically block receptors involved in T cell stimulation activation.

Use of the invention in the context of tissue transplantation therefore excompasses methods to treat the acute phases of the rejection as well as to prevent recurrence of symptoms of rejection. The response to the therapeutic methods of the invention in the context of tissue may be assessed by methods described herein or by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art however no general methods other than detecting an increasing frequency of CTL that recognize donor antigens described infra presently exist to monitor whether a transplant is being rejected by a recipient. Although the function of some transplants may be directly monitored i.e. kidney or liver often the first overt sign of rejection is a complete physiologic failure of the tissue at which point the tissue is normally beyond rescue.

Patients with autoimmune disorders generally have an increasing frequency of CTL that recognize autoantigens. In the context of tissue transplantation the patients will exhibit an increasing frequency of CTL that recognize donor specific antigens. Such autoreactive or donor reactive CTL may be detected in peripheral blood or target tissues. For example in the diabetic patient autoreactive CTL may be detected in pancreatic islet cell tissues in the psoriatic patient autoreactive CTL may be detected in epidermal or dermal tissues in the arthritic patient autoreactive CTL may be detected in synovial cell tissues and in the organ transplant recipient donor reactive CTL may be detected in the transplant graft. Since the generation of autoreactive or donor reactive CTL is thought to precede the development of auto donor antibodies and other indicia of the clinical symptoms of immune disorders detection of specific CTL may in some cases enable more sensitive and specific diagnosis of the disorder.

The assays can also be used to quantify both the absolute number and the proportion of autoreactive CTL present in a sample such as a peripheral blood sample in both pre clinical subjects and patients that have received therapy. In some embodiments both the severity and course of the autoimmune or allograft disorder may be predicted and followed using such assays. For example the human MHC class I molecule HLA A 0201 can be used in combination with the a diabetic autoantigen for example IA 2 to detect autoreactive CTL present in a peripheral blood sample of a pre diabetic subject or diabetic patient currently undergoing therapy using the methods of the invention.

The compounds of the invention can also be used in vivo in combination with for example imaging techniques or other in vivo detection methods for detecting CTLs labeled by binding with compounds or formulations of the invention.

Antigen specific CTLs can be detected using a wide variety of assays including immunospot e.g. ELISPOT assays MHC class I tetramer assays or other assays as described herein or as known to a person skilled in the art.

The time period over which any biomarker of disorder progression or therapeutic effectiveness may be evaluated may be the time period of a single dose or an extended treatment time period e.g. hours days weeks or months.

The compositions and methods of the invention are particularly useful for the prevention treatment or amelioration of T cell mediated diseases such as autoimmune disorders characterized by increased T cell infiltration of lymphocytes into affected tissues or autoimmune disorders characterized by increased T cell activation and or abnormal antigen presentation and or recognition. The compositions and methods are also useful for the prevention treatment or amelioration of inflammatory disorders characterized by increased T cell activation and or abnormal antigen presentation. In specific embodiments the invention provides methods of treating preventing managing or ameliorating the symptoms of an autoimmune disease particularly Type I Diabetes ulcerative colitis psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis lupus particularly cutaneous psoriatic arthritis inflammatory bowel disease IBD ulcerative colitis multiple sclerosis effects from organ transplantation and graft vs. host disease GVHD . Preferably the treatment regimens described herein are administered to patients in early stages of the autoimmune disease exhibiting mild tissue damage resulting from the autoimmune reaction and requiring minimal medical intervention e.g. low doses of standard therapy to manage the disease. The treatment regimens describe herein maintain high level functioning and prevent slow or reduce additional tissue damage. Thus the methods of the invention may reduce the need for additional therapy to treat manage or ameliorate the disease or disorder.

In a preferred embodiment pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more CD3 binding molecules e.g. one or more anti CD3 antibodies are administered one or more times to prevent or reduce a decrease or slow or reduce a decrease in cell function associated with Type 1 diabetes in a subject. In yet another embodiment one or more pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more CD3 binding molecules e.g. one or more anti CD3 antibodies are administered one or ore times to prevent decrease in cell function associated with diabetes in a subject that has had an allograft comprising pancreatic islet cell tissue. In accordance with these embodiments changes in a subject s cell function may be assessed by characterization of daily insulin requirements HA1c levels C peptide function levels or frequency of hypoglycemic episodes as discussed in Section 5.2.1.

The present invention provides compositions comprising one or more anti CD3 antibody and one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents other than anti CD3 antibodies and methods for preventing treating or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder in a subject comprising administering to said subject one or more of said compositions. Therapeutic or prophylactic agents include but are not limited to peptides polypeptides fusion proteins nucleic acid molecules small molecules mimetic agents synthetic drugs inorganic molecules and organic molecules. Any agent which is known to be useful or which has been used or is currently being used for the prevention treatment or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder can be used in combination with an anti CD3 antibody in accordance with the invention described herein. Examples of such agents include but are not limited to antibody fragments GLP 1 analogs or derivatives GLP 1 agaonists e.g. exendin 4 exentatide amylin analogs or dericatives insulin dermatological agents for rashes and swellings e.g. phototherapy i.e. ultraviolet B radiation photochemotherapy e.g. PUVA and topical agents such as emollients salicylic acid coal tar topical steroids topical corticosteroids topical vitamin D3 analogs e.g. calcipotriene tazarotene and topical retinoids anti inflammatory agents e.g. corticosteroids e.g. prednisone and hydrocortisone glucocorticoids steroids non steriodal anti inflammatory drugs e.g. aspirin ibuprofen diclofenac and COX 2 inhibitors beta agonists anticholinergic agents and methyl xanthines immunomodulatory agents e.g. small organic molecules a T cell receptor modulators cytokine receptor modulators T cell depleting agents cytokine antagonists monokine antagonists lymphocyte inhibitors or anti cancer agents gold injections sulphasalazine penicillamine anti angiogenic agents e.g. angiostatin TNF antagonists e.g. anti TNF antibodies and endostatin dapsone psoralens e.g. methoxalen and trioxsalen anti malarial agents e.g. hydroxychloroquine anti viral agents and antibiotics e.g. erythomycin and penicillin . Any immunomodulatory agent well known to one of skill in the art may also be used in the methods and compositions of the invention. Immunomodulatory agents can affect one or more or all aspects of the immune response in a subject. Aspects of the immune response include but are not limited to the inflammatory response the complement cascade leukocyte and lymphocyte differentiation proliferation and or effector function monocyte and or basophil counts and the cellular communication among cells of the immune system. In certain embodiments of the invention an immunomodulatory agent modulates one aspect of the immune response. In other embodiments an immunomodulatory agent modulates more than one aspect of the immune response. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the administration of an immunomodulatory agent to a subject inhibits or reduces one or more aspects of the subject s immune response capabilities. In a specific embodiment of the invention the immunomodulatory agent inhibits or suppresses the immune response in a subject. In accordance with the invention an immunomodulatory agent is not an anti CD3 antibody. In certain embodiments an immunomodulatory agent is not an anti inflammatory agent. In other embodiments an immunomodulatory agent is not a CD3 binding molecule. In yet other embodiments an immunomodulatory agent is not OKT3 or a derivative thereof.

An immunomodulatory agent may be selected to interfere with the interactions between the T helper subsets TH1 or TH2 and B cells to inhibit neutralizing antibody formation. An immunomodulatory agent may be selected to inhibit the interaction between TH1 cells and CTLs to reduce the occurrence of CTL mediated killing. An immunomodulatory agent may be selected to alter e.g. inhibit or suppress the proliferation differentiation activity and or function of the CD4 and or CD8 T cells. For example antibodies specific for T cells can be used as immunomodulatory agents to deplete or alter the proliferation differentiation activity and or function of CD4 and or CD8 T cells.

In a preferred embodiment proteins polypeptides or peptides including antibodies that are utilized as prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory agents are derived from the same species as the recipient of the proteins polypeptides or peptides so as to reduce the likelihood of an immune response to those proteins polypeptides or peptides. In another preferred embodiment when the subject is a human the proteins polypeptides or peptides that are utilized as immunomodulatory agents are human or humanized.

In accordance with the invention one or more prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory agents are administered to a subject with an inflammatory or autoimmune disease prior to subsequent to or concomitantly with the therapeutic and or prophylactic agents of the invention. Preferably one or more prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory agents are administered to a subject with an inflammatory or autoimmune disease to reduce or inhibit one or more symptoms of the disease or aspects of the immune response as necessary. Any technique well known to one skilled in the art can be used to measure one or more aspects of the immune response in a particular subject and thereby determine when it is necessary to administer an immunomodulatory agent to said subject. In a preferred embodiment an absolute lymphocyte count of approximately 500 cells mm preferably 600 cells mm more 700 cells mm and most preferably 800 cells mmis maintained in a subject. In another preferred embodiment a subject with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder is not administered an immunomodulatory agent if their absolute lymphocyte count is 500 cells mmor less 550 cells mmor less 600 cells mmor less 650 cells mmor less 700 cells mmor less 750 cells mmor less or 800 cells mmor less.

In a preferred embodiment one or more prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory agents are administered to a subject with an inflammatory or autoimmune disease so as to transiently reduce or inhibit one or more aspects of the disease or of the immune response. Such a transient inhibition or reduction of one or more aspects of the disease or of the immune system can last for hours days weeks or months. Preferably the transient inhibition or reduction in one or more aspects of the disease or of the immune response last for a few hours e.g. 2 hours 4 hours 6 hours 8 hours 12 hours 14 hours 16 hours 18 hours 24 hours 36 hours or 48 hours a few days e.g. 3 days 4 days 5 days 6 days 7 days or 14 days or a few weeks e.g. 3 weeks 4 weeks 5 weeks or 6 weeks . The transient reduction or inhibition of one or more aspects of the disease or of the immune response enhances the prophylactic and or therapeutic capabilities of an anti CD3 antibody.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding proteins polypeptides or peptides with prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory activity or proteins polypeptides or peptides with prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory activity can be administered to a subject with an inflammatory or autoimmune disease in accordance with the methods of the invention. Further nucleic acid molecules encoding derivatives analogs fragments or variants of proteins polypeptides or peptides with prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory activity or derivatives analogs fragments or variants of proteins polypeptides or peptides with prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory activity can be administered to a subject with an inflammatory or autoimmune disease in accordance with the methods of the invention. Preferably such derivatives analogs variants and fragments retain the prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory activity of the full length wild type protein polypeptide or peptide.

Proteins polypeptides or peptides that can be used as prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory agents can be produced by any technique well known in the art or described herein. See e.g. Chapter 16 Ausubel et al. eds. 1999 Short Protocols in Molecular Biology Fourth Edition John Wiley Sons NY hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety which describes methods of producing proteins polypeptides or peptides and which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Antibodies which can be used as prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory agents can be produced by e.g. methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 245 527 and in Harlow and Lane Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1988 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Preferably agents that are commercially available and known to function as prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory agents are used in the compositions and methods of the invention. The prophylactic therapeutic or immunomodulatory activity of an agent can be determined in vitro and or in vivo by any technique well known to one skilled in the art including e.g. by CTL assays proliferation assays and immunoassays e.g. ELISAs for the expression of particular proteins such as co stimulatory molecules and cytokines.

The combination of one or more anti CD3 antibodies and one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents other than anti CD3 antibodies produces a better prophylactic or therapeutic effect in a subject than either treatment alone. In certain embodiments the combination of an anti CD3 antibody and a prophylactic or therapeutic agent other than an anti CD3 antibody achieves a 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 98 better prophylactic or therapeutic effect in a subject with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder than either treatment alone. In particular embodiments the combination of one or more anti CD3 antibodies and a prophylactic or therapeutic agent other than an anti CD3 antibody achieves a 20 preferably a 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 98 greater reduction in the inflammation of a particular organ tissue or joint in a subject with an inflammatory disorder or an autoimmune disorder which is associated with inflammation than either treatment alone. In other embodiments the combination of one or more anti CD3 antibodies and one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents other than anti CD3 antibodies has an a more than additive effect or synergistic effect in a subject with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder.

The combination therapies of the invention enable lower dosages of anti CD3 antibodies and or less frequent administration of anti CD3 antibodies preferably humanized OKT3 to a subject with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder to achieve a prophylactic or therapeutic effect. The combination therapies of the invention enable lower dosages of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents utilized in conjunction with anti CD3 antibodies for the prevention or treatment of an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder and or less frequent administration of such prophylactic or therapeutic agents to a subject with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder to achieve a prophylactic or therapeutic effect. The combination therapies of the invention reduce or avoid unwanted or adverse side effects associated with the administration of current single agent therapies and or existing combination therapies for autoimmune or inflammatory disorders which in turn improves patient compliance with the treatment protocol.

The prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies of the present invention can be administered concomitantly concurrently or sequentially. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies of the present invention can also be cyclically administered. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first prophylactic or therapeutic agent for a period of time followed by the administration of a second prophylactic or therapeutic agent for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration i.e. the cycle in order to reduce the development of resistance to one of the agents to avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the agents and or to improve the efficacy of the treatment.

See e.g. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 4ed. Lea Febiger Philadelphia Pa. 1985 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. For non sprayable topical dosage forms viscous to semi solid or solid forms comprising a carrier or one or more excipients compatible with topical application and having a dynamic viscosity preferably greater than water are typically employed. Suitable formulations include without limitation solutions suspensions emulsions creams ointments powders liniments salves and the like which are if desired sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents e.g. preservatives stabilizers wetting agents buffers or salts for influencing various properties such as for example osmotic pressure. Other suitable topical dosage forms include sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active ingredient preferably in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier is packaged in a mixture with a pressurized volatile e.g. a gaseous propellant such as freon or in a squeeze bottle.

In addition to the formulations described previously the compositions of the invention may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly or by intramuscular injection. Thus for example the compositions may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil or ion exchange resins or as sparingly soluble derivatives for example as a sparingly soluble salt.

The compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric phosphoric acetic oxalic tartaric acids etc. and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium ferric hydroxides isopropylamine triethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine etc.

Where the composition is administered by injection an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.

In particular the invention provides that one or more anti CD3 antibodies or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of the agent. In one embodiment one or more of the anti CD3 antibodies or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted e.g. with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably one or more of the anti CD3 antibodies or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg more preferably at least 10 mg at least 15 mg at least 25 mg at least 35 mg at least 45 mg at least 50 mg at least 75 mg or at least 100 mg.

Preferably the liquid form of the administered composition is supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 0.25 mg ml more preferably at least 0.5 mg ml at least 1 mg ml at least 2.5 mg ml at least 5 mg ml at least 8 mg ml at least 10 mg ml at least 15 mg kg at least 25 mg ml at least 50 mg ml at least 75 mg ml or at least 100 mg ml. The liquid form should be stored at between 2 C. and 8 C. in its original container.

In a preferred embodiment the invention provides that the composition of the invention is packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of anti CD3 antibody.

The compositions may if desired be presented in a pack or dispenser device that may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil such as a blister pack.

Generally the ingredients of the compositions of the invention are derived from a subject that is the same species origin or species reactivity as recipient of such compositions. Thus in a preferred embodiment human or humanized antibodies are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.

The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in the treatment prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with an inflammatory disease or autoimmune disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the condition and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

For antibodies proteins polypeptides peptides and fusion proteins encompassed by the invention the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.0001 mg kg to 100 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Preferably the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.0001 mg kg and 20 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 10 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 5 mg kg 0.0001 and 2 mg kg 0.0001 and 1 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 0.75 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 0.5 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg to 0.25 mg kg 0.0001 to 0.15 mg kg 0.0001 to 0.10 mg kg 0.001 to 0.5 mg kg 0.01 to 0.25 mg kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Generally human antibodies have a longer half life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the antibodies by modifications such as for example lipidation.

CD3 binding molecules may be characterized in a variety of ways. In particular CD3 binding molecules may be assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to a CD3 polypeptide. Such an assay may be performed in solution e.g. Houghten 1992 Bio Techniques 13 412 421 on beads Lam 1991 Nature 354 82 84 on chips Fodor 1993 Nature 364 555 556 on bacteria U.S. Pat. No. 5 223 409 on spores U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 698 5 403 484 and 5 223 409 on plasmids Cull et al. 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 1865 1869 or on phage Scott and Smith 1990 Science 249 386 390 Devlin 1990 Science 249 404 406 Cwirla et al. 1990 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 6378 6382 and Felici 1991 J. Mol. Biol. 222 301 310 each of these references is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference . CD3 binding molecules that have been identified to immunospecifically bind to a CD3 polypeptide can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for a CD3 polypeptide.

CD3 binding molecules may be assayed for immunospecific binding to a CD3 polypeptide and cross reactivity with other polypeptides by any method known in the art. Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding and cross reactivity include but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below but are not intended by way of limitation .

Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer 1 NP 40 or Triton X 100 1 sodium deoxycholate 0.1 SDS 0.15 M NaCl 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2 1 Trasylol supplemented with protein phosphatase and or protease inhibitors e.g. EDTA PMSF aprotinin sodium vanadate adding the CD3 binding molecule of interest to the cell lysate incubating for a period of time e.g. 1 to 4 hours at 40 C. adding protein A and or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate incubating for about an hour or more at 40 C. washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS sample buffer. The ability of the CD3 binding molecule of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by e.g. western blot analysis. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the binding of the CD3 binding molecule to a CD3 polypeptide and decrease the background e.g. pre clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads . For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.16.1 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel e.g. 8 20 SDS PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose PVDF or nylon blocking the membrane in blocking solution e.g. PBS with 3 BSA or non fat milk washing the membrane in washing buffer e.g. PBS Tween 20 blocking the membrane with CD3 binding molecule of interest e.g. an antibody of interest diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in washing buffer blocking the membrane with an antibody which recognizes the CD3 binding molecule conjugated to an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase or radioactive molecule e.g. P or I diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in wash buffer and detecting the presence of the CD3 polypeptide. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.8.1 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

ELISAs comprise preparing CD3 polypeptide coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the CD3 polypeptide adding the CD3 binding molecule of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase to the well and incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the CD3 polypeptide. In ELISAs the CD3 binding molecule of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound instead an antibody which recognizes the CD3 binding molecule of interest conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further instead of coating the well with the CD3 polypeptide the CD3 binding molecule may be coated to the well. In this case an antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the CD3 polypeptide to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 11.2.1 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The binding affinity of a CD3 binding molecule to a CD3 polypeptide and the off rate of an CD3 binding molecule CD3 polypeptide interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled CD3 polypeptide e.g. H or I with the CD3 binding molecule of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled CD3 polypeptide and the detection of the CD3 binding molecule bound to the labeled CD3 polypeptide. The affinity of a CD3 binding molecule for a CD3 polypeptide and the binding off rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second CD3 binding molecule can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case a CD3 polypeptide is incubated with a CD3 binding molecule conjugated to a labeled compound e.g. H or I in the presence of increasing amounts of a second unlabeled CD3 binding molecule.

In a preferred embodiment BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of CD3 binding molecules to a CD3 polypeptide. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of a CD3 polypeptide from chips with immobilized CD3 binding molecules on their surface.

An example of one such model is the murine adoptive transfer model in which aeroallergen provocation of TH1 or TH2 recipient mice results in TH effector cell migration to the airways and is associated with an intense neutrophilic TH1 and eosinophilic TH2 lung mucosal inflammatory response Cohn et al. 1997 J. Exp. Med. 1861737 1747 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

Animal models for autoimmune disorders can also be used to assess the efficacy of anti CD3 antibodies or pharmaceutical compositions of invention. Animal models for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes thyroid autoimmunity sytemic lupus eruthematosus and glomerulonephritis have been developed Bluestone et al. 2004 PNAS 101 14622 14626 Flanders et al. 1999 Autoimmunity 29 235 246 Krogh et al. 1999 Biochimie 81 511 515 Foster 1999 Semin. Nephrol. 19 12 24 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

The efficacy of anti CD3 antibodies or pharmaceutical compositions of invention can also be tested in such autoimmune disorder models as an experimental allergic encephalomyelitis EAE model. EAE is an experimental autoimmune disease of the central nervous system CNS Zamvil et al 1990 Ann. Rev Immunol. 8 579 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and is a disease model for the human autoimmune condition multiple sclerosis MS . EAE is an example of a cell mediated autoimmune disorder that is mediated via T cells. EAE is readily induced in mammalian species by immunizations of myelin basic protein MBP purified from the CNS or an encephalitogenic proteolipid PLP . SJL J mice are a susceptible strain of mice H 2u and upon induction of EAE these mice develop an acute paralytic disease and an acute cellular infiltrate is identifiable within the CNS. EAE spontaneously develops in MBP1 17 peptide specific T cell receptor TCR transgenic mice TgMBP of a RAG 1 deficient background Lafaille et al. 1994 Cell 78 399 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

Further any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate anti CD3 antibodies or the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein for autoimmune and or inflammatory diseases.

The toxicity and or efficacy of anti CD3 antibodies or pharmaceutical compositions of invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD ED. Anti CD3 antibodies that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While anti CD3 antibodies that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and thereby reduce side effects.

The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of anti CD3 antibodies for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC i.e. the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography.

Efficacy in preventing or treating an autoimmune disorder may be demonstrated e.g. by detecting the ability of a anti CD3 antibodies or composition of the invention to reduce one or more symptoms of the autoimmune disorder to reduce mean absolute lymphocyte counts to decrease T cell activation to decrease T cell proliferation to reduce cytokine production or to modulate one or more particular cytokine profiles. Efficacy in treating diabetes may be demonstrated e.g. by detecting the ability of a anti CD3 antibodies or composition of the invention to reduce one or more symptoms of dibetes to preserve the C peptide response to MMTT to reduce the level HA1 or HA1c to reduce the daily requirement for insulin or to decrease T cell activation in pancreatic islet tissue. Efficacy in preventing or treating an inflammatory disorder may be demonstrated e.g. by detecting the ability of a an anti CD3 antibody to reduce one or more symptoms of the inflammatory disorder to decrease T cell activation to decrease T cell proliferation to modulate one or more cytokine profiles to reduce cytokine production to reduce inflammation of a joint organ or tissue or to improve quality of life.

Changes in inflammatory disease activity may be assessed through tender and swollen joint counts patient and physician global scores for pain and disease activity and the ESR CRP. Progression of structural joint damage may be assessed by quantitative scoring of X rays of hands wrists and feet Sharp method . Changes in functional status in humans with inflammatory disorders may be evaluated using the Health Assessment Questionnaire HAQ and quality of life changes are assessed with the SF 36.

The effect of one or more doses of one or more the ability of a anti CD3 antibodies or composition of the invention to reduce one or more symptoms of an autoimmune or donor specific immune disorder on peripheral blood lymphocyte counts can be monitored assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. Peripheral blood lymphocytes counts in a mammal can be determined by e.g. obtaining a sample of peripheral blood from said mammal separating the lymphocytes from other components of peripheral blood such as plasma using e.g. Ficoll Hypaque Pharmacia gradient centrifugation and counting the lymphocytes using trypan blue. Peripheral blood T cell counts in mammal can be determined by e.g. separating the lymphocytes from other components of peripheral blood such as plasma using e.g. a use of Ficoll Hypaque Pharmacia gradient centrifugation labeling the T cells with an antibody directed to a T cell antigen such as CD2 CD3 CD4 and CD8 which is conjugated to FITC or phycoerythrin and measuring the number of T cells by FACS. Further the effect on a particular subset of T cells e.g. CD2 CD4 CD8 CD4RO CD8RO CD4RA or CD8RA cells can be determined using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art such as FACS.

The percentage of CD3 polypeptides expressed by peripheral blood lymphocytes bound by anti CD3 antibodies prior or after or both prior to and after the administration of one or more doses of anti CD3 antibodies can be assessed using standard techniques known to one of skill in the art. The percentage of CD3 polypeptides expressed by peripheral blood T cells bound by anti CD3 antibodies can be determined by e.g. obtaining a sample of peripheral blood from a mammal separating the lymphocytes from other components of peripheral blood such as plasma using e.g. Ficoll Hypaque Pharmacia gradient centrifugation and labeling the T cells with an anti CD3 binding molecule antibody other than that of the invention conjugated to FITC and an antibody directed to a T cell antigen such as CD3 CD4 or CD8 which is conjugated to phycoerythrin and determining the number of T cells labeled with anti CD3 binding molecule antibody relative to the number of T cells labeled with an antibody directed to a T cell antigen using FACS.

Antibodies that immunospecifically bind to an CD3 polypeptide can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies in particular by chemical synthesis or preferably by recombinant expression techniques.

Polyclonal antibodies that immunospecifically bind to an antigen can be produced by various procedures well known in the art. For example a human antigen can be administered to various host animals including but not limited to rabbits mice rats etc. to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the human antigen. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and include but are not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and corynebacterium parvum. Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.

Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma recombinant and phage display technologies or a combination thereof. For example monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught for example in Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and T cell Hybridomas 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties . The term monoclonal antibody as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term monoclonal antibody refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone including any eukaryotic prokaryotic or phage clone and not the method by which it is produced.

Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. Briefly mice can be immunized with a CD3 antigen and once an immune response is detected e.g. antibodies specific for a CD3 antigen preferably CD3 antigen are detected in the mouse serum the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells for example cells from cell line SP20 available from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention. Ascites fluid which generally contains high levels of antibodies can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.

Accordingly the present invention provides methods of generating antibodies by culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein preferably the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with a CD3 antigen with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind to a CD3 antigen preferably CD3 antigen .

Antibody fragments which recognize specific CD3 antigens preferably CD3 antigen may be generated by any technique known to those of skill in the art. For example Fab and F ab 2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules using enzymes such as papain to produce Fab fragments or pepsin to produce F ab 2 fragments . F ab 2 fragments contain the variable region the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain. Further the antibodies of the present invention can also be generated using various phage display methods known in the art.

In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular DNA sequences encoding VH and VL domains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries e.g. human or murine cDNA libraries of affected tissues . The DNA encoding the VH and VL domains are recombined together with an scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector. The vector is electroporated in and the is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 and the VH and VL domains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to a particular antigen can be selected or identified with antigen e.g. using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al. 1995 J. Immunol. Methods 182 41 50 Ames et al. 1995 J. Immunol. Methods 184 177 186 Kettleborough et al. 1994 Eur. J.

As described in the above references after phage selection the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies including human antibodies or any other desired antigen binding fragment and expressed in any desired host including mammalian cells insect cells plant cells yeast and bacteria e.g. as described below. Techniques to recombinantly produce Fab Fab and F ab 2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication No. WO 92 22324 Mullinax et al. 1992 BioTechniques 12 6 864 869 Sawai et al. 1995 AJRI 34 26 34 and Better et al. 1988 Science 240 1041 1043 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

To generate whole antibodies PCR primers including VH or VL nucleotide sequences a restriction site and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site can be used to amplify the VH or VL sequences in scFv clones. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art the PCR amplified VH domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a VH constant region e.g. the human gamma 4 constant region and the PCR amplified VL domains can be cloned into vectors expressing a VL constant region e.g. human kappa or lamba constant regions. Preferably the vectors for expressing the VH or VL domains comprise an EF 1 promoter a secretion signal a cloning site for the variable domain constant domains and a selection marker such as neomycin. The VH and VL domains may also cloned into one vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full length antibodies e.g. IgG using techniques known to those of skill in the art.

For some uses including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays it may be preferable to use human or chimeric antibodies. Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human subjects. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 444 887 and 4 716 111 and International Publication Nos. WO 98 46645 WO 98 50433 WO 98 24893 WO 98 16654 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 and WO 91 10741 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively the human variable region constant region and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular homozygous deletion of the Jregion prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then be bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar 1995 Int. Rev. Immunol. 13 65 93 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies see e.g. PCT publication Nos.

Freemont Calif. and Genpharm San Jose Calif. can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.

A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison 1985 Science 229 1202 Oi et al. 1986 BioTechniques 4 214 Gillies et al. 1989 J. Immunol. Methods 125 191 202 and U.S. Pat.

A humanized antibody is an antibody or its variant or fragment thereof which is capable of binding to a predetermined antigen and which comprises a framework region having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and a CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non human immuoglobulin. A humanized antibody comprises substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains Fab Fab F ab Fabc Fv in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin i.e. donor antibody and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. Preferably a humanized antibody also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Ordinarily the antibody will contain both the light chain as well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. The antibody also may include the CH1 hinge CH2 CH3 and CH4 regions of the heavy chain. The humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins including IgM IgG IgD IgA and IgE and any isotype including IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. Usually the constant domain is a complement fixing constant domain where it is desired that the humanized antibody exhibit cytotoxic activity and the class is typically IgG1. Where such cytotoxic activity is not desirable the constant domain may be of the IgG2 class. Examples of VL and VH constant domains that can be used in certain embodiments of the invention include but are not limited to C kappa and C gamma 1 nG1m described in Johnson et al. 1997 176 1215 1224 and those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 824 307 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype and selecting particular constant domains to optimize desired effector functions is within the ordinary skill in the art. The framework and CDR regions of a humanized antibody need not correspond precisely to the parental sequences e.g. the donor CDR or the consensus framework may be mutagenized by substitution insertion or deletion of at least one residue so that the CDR or framework residue at that site does not correspond to either the consensus or the import antibody. Such mutations however will not be extensive. Usually at least 75 of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the parental FR and CDR sequences more often 90 and most preferably greater than 95 . Humanized antibody can be produced using variety of techniques known in the art including but not limited to CDR grafting European Patent No. EP 239 400 International publication No. WO 91 09967 and U.S. Pat.

No. US 2005 0042664 A1 Feb. 24 2005 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Often framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 and Riechmann et al. 1988 Nature 332 323 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. 

Single domain antibodies for example antibodies lacking the light chains can be produced by methods well known in the art. See Riechmann et al. 1999 J. Immuno. 231 25 38 Nuttall et al. 2000 Curr. Pharm. Biotechnol. 1 3 253 263 Muylderman 2001 J. Biotechnol. 74 4 277302 U.S. Pat. No. 6 005 079 and International Publication Nos.

The invention provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody that immunospecifically binds to a CD3 polypeptide. The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under high stringency intermediate or lower stringency hybridization conditions e.g. as defined supra to polynucleotides that encode an antibody of the invention.

The polynucleotides may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art. The nucleotide sequence of antibodies immunospecific for a CD3 polypeptide can be obtained e.g. from the literature or a database such as GenBank. Since the amino acid sequences of e.g. humanized OKT3 is known nucleotide sequences encoding these antibodies can be determined using methods well known in the art i.e. nucleotide codons known to encode particular amino acids are assembled in such a way to generate a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody. Such a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. 1994 BioTechniques 17 242 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Alternatively a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or a cDNA library generated from or nucleic acid preferably poly A RNA isolated from any tissue or cells expressing the antibody such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify e.g. a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.

Once the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is determined the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences e.g. recombinant DNA techniques site directed mutagenesis PCR etc. see for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence for example to create amino acid substitutions deletions and or insertions.

In a specific embodiment one or more of the CDRs is inserted within framework regions using routine recombinant DNA techniques. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions and preferably human framework regions see e.g. Chothia et al. 1998 J. Mol. Biol. 278 457 479 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for a listing of human framework regions . Preferably the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds to a CD3 polypeptide. Preferably as discussed supra one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions and preferably the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.

Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding molecules of the invention i.e. antibodies has been obtained the vector for the production of the molecules may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the coding sequences for the molecules of the invention and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. See for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of a molecule identified by the methods of the invention i.e. an antibody can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques e.g. electroporation liposomal transfection and calcium phosphate precipitation and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the molecules of the invention. In specific embodiments the expression of the molecules of the invention is regulated by a constitutive an inducible or a tissue specific promoter. In specific embodiments the expression vector pMGX1303 .

The host cells used to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention may be either bacterial cells such as or preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins Foecking et al. 199845 101 Cockett et al. 19908 2 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the molecules of the invention may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express the molecules of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. and transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing coding sequences for the molecules identified by the methods of the invention yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing the sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV and tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 293T 3T3 cells lymphotic cells see U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 715 Per C.6 cells human retinal cells developed by Crucell harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter .

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 19832 1791 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye 198513 3101 3109 Van Heeke Schuster 198924 5503 5509 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free gluta thione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions e.g. the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter e.g. the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts e.g. see Logan Shenk 198481 355 359 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. 1987153 51 544 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK Hela COS MDCK 293 293T 3T3 W138 BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT20 and T47D CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express an antibody of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibodies of the invention. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibodies of the invention.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 197711 223 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 199248 202 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 198022 817 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 198077 357 O Hare et al. 198178 1527 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 198178 2072 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 12 488 505 Wu and Wu 1991 3 87 95 Tolstoshev 199332 573 596 Mulligan 1993260 926 932 and Morgan and Anderson 199362 191 217 May 199311 5 155 215 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. eds. 1993 John Wiley Sons NY Kriegler 199012 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds 1994 John Wiley Sons NY. Colberre Garapin et al. 1981150 1 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 198430 147 each of said references is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

The expression levels of an antibody of the invention can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel Vol. 3 Academic Press New York 1987 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of the antibody production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. 19833 257 .

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot 1986322 52 Kohler 198077 2197 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Once a molecule of the invention i.e. antibodies has been recombinantly expressed it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of polypeptides or antibodies for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of polypeptides or antibodies.
