abstract: A system for the measurement of an angle of roll of a projectile is disclosed. The projectile has a casing with a rear end, a front end, and a side wall extending therebetween. The system includes a radar configured to transmit a polarized electromagnetic signal toward the projectile and a groove disposed on the side wall of the casing. The groove has a width, a depth, and a length, the width extending along a longitudinal axis of the projectile, the depth extending inwardly from an outer surface of the casing toward the longitudinal axis, and the length extending along the outside of the casing. The radar is further configured to receive a return signal from the projectile, wherein the return signal from the groove is modulated as a function of the angle of roll of the projectile. Amplitude or phase modulation of the return signal from the groove can be used to uniquely determine the roll angle of the projectile.

The present disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for measuring the unambiguous roll angle of a projectile.

Various approaches exist for determining the roll angle of a projectile using polarized radiation. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 039 029 describes an approach where a monitor determines from the ground the orientation roll and attitude of a missile by observing the character of a signal transmitted therefrom. By transmitting a linearly polarized signal to a ground receiver the missile identifies a given plane fixed with respect to the body frame of the missile. The plane is identified at the ground receiver by comparing the ratio of the signal received in any two cross polarized directions. To resolve the attendant 180 ambiguity the monitor employs an antenna array disposed on the missile that is switchable back and forth between two equal power lobes. The monitor operates with a single transmitter and the lobe structure of the transmitted signal is obtained using a linearly polarized antenna array with electronic phase switching between the aforementioned equal power lobes. This approach requires that the projectile contain a transmitter therefore creating additional costs and requiring valuable space on the projectile.

Another approach for determining the roll angle of a projectile using polarized radiation is disclosed and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 414 430. The system described therein includes a transmitter for emitting position determining polarized radiation space wave in the direction of the projectile and a receiver arranged in the projectile for receiving the emitted radiation. The emitted space wave is composed of a carrier wave reference with frequency f which has been phase modulated with a modulation frequency f wherein f

Yet another approach for determining the roll angle of a projectile is to use polarization sensitive reflectors. U.S. Pat. No. 5 490 643 describes a system including an optical device located in the rear of a projectile the optical device having a retro reflector fitted with a polarizer and at the projectile firing station a light source whose beam illuminates the rear of the projectile. A light flux analyzer deduces the roll angle of the projectile from the direction of polarization of the light flux reflected by the projectile. The polarizer has a refraction index discontinuity positioned on the rear of the projectile before the retro reflector with an angle of inclination between the direction normal to its plane of index variation and the longitudinal axis of the projectile and chosen to be greater than the Brewster angle. The light source is laterally offset laterally with respect to the firing axis of the projectile. These two measurements give rise to a modulation of intensity of the reflected light beam as a function of the roll angle plus or minus 2 which gives to two successive maximum values of the signal of the analyzer different amplitudes that enable the signals to be differentiated and therefore make it possible to remove the ambiguity of resulting from the measurement of the direction of polarization. This approach requires space on the end of the projectile. For some missiles rockets and artillery pieces there is no space available on the back of the projectile for the polarization sensitive reflectors. For example for some missiles the end of the missile is occupied by motor components. As well exhaust plumes may mask the end of the projectile.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 483 455 discloses a device for the unambiguous measurement of the angle of roll of a projectile. The system includes a radar equipped with means for processing and sending a signal to the casing of the projectile in at least one direction of incident polarization and a set of parallel grooves made on the casing the depth of which is modulated dissymmetrically with respect to the axis of symmetry of the projectile. The axis of symmetry of the projectile does not pass through the point of the antenna of the radar where the antenna beam is generated. The processing means analyze in reception a signal that is back scattered by the casing of the projectile the signal being modulated as a function of the angle of roll of the projectile. The modulation has two maximum local values corresponding to two angular roll positions of the projectile when the polarization is parallel to the grooves. The processing means removes the 180 ambiguity by comparing the levels of the local maximum values. Again this approach requires space on the end of the projectile for the placement of the grooves. As previously noted space is not always available at the end of a projectile.

Therefore there is a need for improved systems and methods that address these and other shortcomings of the prior art.

Briefly described systems and methods for determining the unambiguous roll angle of a projectile are disclosed. A representative embodiment of a system for the measurement of an angle of roll of a projectile the projectile having a casing with a rear end a front end and a side wall extending therebetween includes a radar transmitter configured to transmit a polarized electromagnetic signal toward the projectile. A groove is disposed on the side wall of the casing the groove having a width a depth and a length the width extending along a longitudinal axis of the projectile the depth extending inwardly from an outer surface of the casing toward the longitudinal axis and the length extending along the outside of the casing. The system also includes a radar receiver configured to receive a return signal from the projectile. The amplitude of the return signal from the groove is varied as a function of the angle of roll of the projectile.

The foregoing description has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present disclosure to the precise forms disclosed. Modifications and or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. The embodiments discussed however were chosen and described to illustrate the principles of the present disclosure and its practical application to thereby enable a person having ordinary skill in the art to utilize the present disclosure and various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. All such modifications and or variations are within the scope of the present disclosure as determined by the appended claims when interpreted in accordance with the breadth to which they are fairly and legally entitled.

Disclosed herein are systems apparatuses and methods to which an angle of roll of a projectile can be measured. In particular the angle of roll of the projectile can be measured using radar that is configured to transmit an electromagnetic signal toward the projectile and receive a return signal from the projectile. The projectile has a roll angle groove exposed on a side wall of a casing of the projectile. The electromagnetic signal that is transmitted by the radar reflects off of the roll angle groove of the projectile which provides a return signal received by the radar. The roll rate and the unambiguous roll angle can be determined from the amplitude modulation and or phase modulation of a radar return signal scattered by the groove. The roll rate and the unambiguous roll angle can be used to initiate an action on the projectile that requires knowledge of these parameters through a wireless communication link on the projectile. For example the projectile can have a thruster on the side wall of the projectile to steer the projectile to an intended target based on the determined roll rate and unambiguous roll angle. Example systems are first discussed with reference figures. After the exemplary systems have been described examples of the operation of the system are provided to explain the manner in which the angle of roll of the projectile can be measured.

Referring now in more detail to the figures in which like reference numerals identify corresponding parts is a perspective view of an embodiment of a system that measures an angle of roll of a projectile. The system includes a projectile A and radar . The projectile A includes a roll angle groove A disposed on a casing of the projectile A which is further described in relation to . The projectile launch device not shown is displaced from the location of the radar . The radar transmits electromagnetic signal A B preferably polarized to the projectile A. Because of the close proximity of the surface to the radar and the projectile A the transmitted electromagnetic signal A B reaches the projectile A in multiple paths. For example the electromagnetic signal A reaches the back of the rear end of the projectile A. The electromagnetic signal A hits the back of the projectile A and bounces back a return signal A to the radar . The electromagnetic signal B also travels on another path that bounces off a surface such as ground or water then off the roll angle groove A of the projectile A. The electromagnetic signal B returns back to the surface then to the radar as return signal B. The radar calculates the amplitude modulation based on the return signal A and B which can be used to determine the roll rate and is used to determine the unambiguous roll angle of the projectile A.

It should be noted that although show the projectile launch device being parallel to the surface the system can be employed where the projectile launch device is not parallel to the surface as the projectile launch device travels to its target. In general the system can be employed as long as the groove or grooves is intermittently shadowed from the radar signal as the projectile rotates.

The first width W is the distance between the opposed sides at each of the opposed ends . The second width W is the distance between the opposed sides at the center of the roll angle groove A. The second width W is greater than the first width W and the width of the roll angle groove A increases from each end of the opposed ends to the center shown in of the roll angle groove A. The opposed side of the roll angle groove A is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and the opposed side is in a plane that extends at an acute angle relative to the opposed side of the projectile A. The width of the groove A increases monotonically e.g. linearly from each of the opposed ends to the center of the roll angle groove A. The depth D of the groove A is the distance between the base of the groove A and the outside surface of the side wall . The varying width of the projectile A enables the system to modulate the amplitude of the return signal deflected off the roll angle groove A as a function of roll angle. The return signal that is deflected off the roll angle groove A having the smallest amplitude modulation near the opposed ends and the largest amplitude modulation near the center of the roll angle groove A. The amplitude modulation created by the roll angle groove A on the return signal facilitates determining the roll rate and unambiguous roll angle of the projectile A. The modulation of the amplitude of the return signal is further described in relation to .

Because of the interference caused from the return signal of the crease the deflecting groove deflects the return signal of the crease away from the radar . The deflecting groove is disposed on the side wall of the casing and extends at an acute angle e.g. 30 degrees relative to the latitudinal axis of the projectile B. The deflecting groove includes a pair of opposed sides and a pair of opposed ends . The deflecting groove has a constant third width W and a constant second depth D shown in and a second length L shown in in which the third width W extends along the longitudinal axis of the projectile B. The second depth D extends inwardly from an outer surface of the casing toward the longitudinal axis and the second length L extends substantially along the latitudinal axis outside of the casing . The deflecting groove enables the radar to receive the return signal from the roll angle groove B with less interference caused by the return signal of the crease .

In an alternative embodiment the position of the roll angle groove D along the longitudinal axis quadratically changes as a function of roll angle. The position of the roll angle groove D relative to the longitudinal axis is

In block the method includes transmitting a polarized electromagnetic signal toward the projectile . The projectile has a radar signature that varies with the angle of roll of the projectile . In block receiving a signal from the projectile in which the return signal is modulated by at least a portion of the projectile on which the roll angle groove is exposed. In block the return signal is processed to determine the effect of the roll angle groove on the modulated return signal .
