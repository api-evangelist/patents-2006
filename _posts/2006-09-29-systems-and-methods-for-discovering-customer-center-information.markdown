Customer centers are staffed by agents who handle incoming and or outgoing contacts. Although the traditional and most common form of contact is by phone other types of contacts are becoming more common e.g. text chat web collaboration email and fax . A customer center may include but is not limited to outsourced contact centers outsourced customer relationship management customer relationship management voice of the customer customer interaction contact center multi media contact center remote office distributed enterprise work at home agents remote agents branch office back office performance optimization workforce optimization hosted contact centers and speech analytics for example.

In order to facilitate customer center contacts a customer center typically includes an agent phone and a workstation computer. A network connects one or more of the agent computers. During a customer contact the agent interacts with one or more applications running on the workstation. Workstation applications give the agent access to customer records product information ordering status and transaction history for example.

Customer centers typically record telephone contacts of an agent along with data indicating what information was accessed or entered by the agent via an agent workstation. Unfortunately different agents may use different telephones and or agent computers over a period of time making difficult to track the telephone and workstation contacts corresponding to an agent especially when an agent uses a laptop in combination with various customer center telephones.

Customer center information discovery systems and methods are disclosed. An embodiment of a method for discovering customer center information includes receiving a plurality of customer center information from a plurality of respective information sources and correlating the plurality of customer center information to determine an identity of a customer center agent accessing customer center resources.

An embodiment of a system for discovering customer center information includes memory software stored in the memory processor and at least one communication interface configured to receive a plurality of customer center information from a plurality of respective information sources wherein the processor is instructed by the software to correlate the plurality of customer center information to determine an identity of a customer center agent accessing customer center resources.

Another embodiment of a method for discovering customer center information includes receiving telephone identification information from a first information source receiving computer identification information from a second information source receiving information identifying a customer center agent from a third information source correlating at least one of the telephone identification information and the computer identification information with the information identifying the customer center agent and determining that at least one of the telephone identification information and the computer identification information corresponds to the customer center agent.

Other objects features and advantages of the embodiments will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following drawings and detailed description.

Systems and methods are provided that discover workspace information corresponding to respective customer center agents. The workspace information is gathered from different sources such as for example a customer center agent computer a customer center agent telephone a telephone control device e.g. a telephone switch an automatic call distributor ACD or a call manager control device a CTI computer telephony integration server a human resources computer a server hosting a customer relations management CRM application and or a network server. The information that is gathered may identify for example a customer center agent a customer center computer and or a customer center telephone. The gathered information is analyzed to determine which customer center computer and or telephone is being used by a particular customer center agent. In other words gathered information is used to map a customer center workspace. This enables a customer center to track and record contacts and activities corresponding to respective customer center agents regardless of the customer center resources that the agent is using.

The external information sources and or provide customer center information to the customer center explorer . The customer center information provided may identify for example a customer center agent a customer center computer and or a customer center telephone. The customer center information may be requested by the customer center explorer from the external information sources and or and or may be provided to the customer center explorer without the need for a specific request by the customer center explorer for the customer center information. For example customer center information may be provided by the external information sources and or to the customer center explorer at predetermined intervals and or responsive to a change made to the customer center information stored in the external information sources and or .

The customer center explorer may use customer center information received from the external information sources and or to create and or update a customer center information data structure e.g. database . The customer center explorer may alternatively simply associate information received from various external information sources. The customer center explorer may receive some or all of the following information from respective external information sources as will be explained in further detail below telephone extensions on a telephone control device extension to telephone mappings e.g. a single telephone may have more than one extension or multiple lines for an extension customer center agent identifications agent IDs configured on the telephone control device agentID to agent name mappings identity of agent computers e.g. workstations coupled to a customer center network identity of domains groups of networked computers that share common communications addresses network login information ACD login information extension numbers hunt groups skill groups and information about agents e.g. names positions in the company dates of birth social security numbers e mail addresses pay rates names of supervisors and or home addresses .

By matching the names provided by one external information source to the names provided by another external information source the customer center explorer can determine which telephone or telephone extension s and or computer or terminal server session corresponds to each customer center agent. This then enables a customer center to map customer center workspaces and to track and record contacts and activities corresponding to respective customer center agents.

Customer center workspaces may be mapped dynamically as the workspaces change. For example a customer center explorer receives information from a first information source indicating that an agent named john doe has the agentID . The contact center explorer then receives information from a second information source indicating that an agent having the agentID has logged into a telephone having the ID . The customer center explorer can then associate the name john doe the agentID and the telephone ID which are collectively considered a workspace.

Continuing with this example the contact center explorer also receives information from a third information source indicating that john doe has the network login ID jdoe. When a fourth information source provides the contact center explorer with information indicating that someone has logged into the workstation jdoe having the network login ID jdoe the mapped workspace can be expanded by associating the name john doe the agentID the telephone ID the network login ID jdoe and the workstation jdoe.

When the contact center explorer later receives information indicating a logout event involving the mapped workspace then the workspace association can be modified accordingly. For example when the fourth information source provides the contact center explorer with information indicating that someone having the network login ID jdoe has logged off from the workstation jdoe then the mapped workspace can be reduced by excluding the workstation jdoe from the association. The revised mapped workspace would then only include the name john doe the agentID the telephone ID and the network login ID jdoe for example.
