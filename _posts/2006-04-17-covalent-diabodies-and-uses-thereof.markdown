title: Covalent diabodies and uses thereof
abstract: The present invention is directed to diabody molecules and uses thereof in the treatment of a variety of diseases and disorders, including immunological disorders, infectious disease, intoxication and cancers. The diabody molecules of the invention comprise two polypeptide chains that associate to form at least two epitope binding sites, which may recognize the same or different epitopes on the same or differing antigens. Additionally, the antigens may be from the same or different molecules. The individual polypeptide chains of the diabody molecule may be covalently bound through non-peptide bond covalent bonds, such as, but not limited to, disulfide bonding of cysteine residues located within each polypeptide chain. In particular embodiments, the diabody molecules of the present invention further comprise an Fc region, which allows antibody-like functionality to engineered into the molecule.
