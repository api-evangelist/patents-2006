The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

Government and private officials often have responsibility for controlled areas subject to restrictive access to authorized persons. Such officials may employ various techniques to detect human presence. These tools generally depend on human activity to present a detectable signal.

Human activity may trigger a sensor based on various stimuli. For example skeletal muscular physical motion may form pressure gradients in the local environment either the surrounding air or through the ground. For sufficiently intense pressure gradients such motion may register motion or audio signals. Complimentarily metabolic activity may yield a thermal contrast between the temperatures of a human body and the ambient surroundings.

Various embodiments are described relating to devices and methods for detecting local human presence by the reception and detection of human specific volatile organic compound VOC molecules dispersed in air. According to an example embodiment such devices include a chamber inlet a trap a sensor and a communicator. The inlet receives the air that contains the human specific VOC molecules a trap for capturing the VOC molecules in the air.

The sensor detects at least a threshold quantity of at least one of 3 hydroxy 3 methylhexanoic 3H3MH acid and 3 methyl 2 hexanoic 3M2H acid among the VOC molecules. The communicator provides notification of the threshold quantity. The methods include operations to receive the air capture the molecules in the air detect the 3H3MH and 3M2H acids and signal notification of that detection.

According to an example embodiment the trap includes a sieve for capturing the VOC molecules from the air and a heater for releasing the captured VOC molecules from the sieve. In addition the sensor comprises a chemical analyzer such as for example an ion mobility spectroscope a gas chromatograph a gas chromatograph plus a mass spectroscope and a flame ionization spectroscope. The corresponding exemplary method employs chemical detection of the 3H3MH and 3M2H acids.

According to another example embodiment the trap comprises a filter that includes polyacrylamide fibers for capturing the VOC molecules from the air. In addition the sensor comprises an electrode for responding to a physical property change in the polyacrylamide fibers. This physical property change such as electrical characteristics is caused by at least one of the 3H3MH and 3M2H acids in the captured VOC molecules. The corresponding exemplary method employs detection of characteristic changes in the filter s electrical properties.

Motion and thermal detectors require either physical or metabolic activity that cannot distinguish between human presence and non human stimuli on a consistent or systematical basis. Consequently sensor indication of movement or thermal contrast may result in false alarms that unproductively expend resources that operatives prefer to conserve. Thus various exemplary embodiments describe techniques for exploiting human characteristics that exhibit unique and detectable manifestations.

Human skin especially in axillary i.e. armpit regions produces perspiration secretions whose molecules can be truncated by bacteria to produce hexanoic acids that represent volatile organic compound VOC molecules. These VOC molecules produce a recognizable odor and represent a uniquely human chemical signature at least in detectable quantities. The odor produced by the VOC molecules can be sensed by olfactory receptors. The VOC molecules as represented by hexanoic acids include 3 hydroxy 3 methylhexanoic 3H3MH acid and 3 methyl 2 hexanoic 3M2H acid. After being captured these VOC molecules can be heated to increase volatility for spectroscopic detection.

The system further includes a communicator . Upon detection of threshold triggering quantities of 3H3MH and or 3M2H acids the communicator or signaler transmits a wireless signal to a remote receiver not shown for intrusion and or threat assessment.

A person within detection vicinity of the system releases VOC molecules into the ambient air A first fan within the first convection portion drives the air into the chamber . The molecules in the air enter the inlet portion and pass into a sieve disposed within the first filter portion at a first position. The sieve serves to capture or trap the molecules by filtering the air passing therethrough.

In various exemplary embodiments the sieve is a polymeric filter that chemically binds to the molecules thereby capturing them in the sieve . A transfer mechanism shown symbolically may remove the sieve from its first position in the first filter portion to a second position in the second filter portion . Alternatively the sieve may be transferred manually from its first to second filter positions.

The second convection portion includes a second fan with which to blow air over the sieve disposed at the second position. A heater in the heater portion in cooperation with the second fan volatilizes and releases the trapped molecules on the sieve at the second position. The air carries these molecules by convection to the analysis portion . The second fan and the heater may be disposed preferably upstream of the filter s second position.

The analysis portion includes a chemical analyzer to evaluate the molecules for the presence of 3H3MH and or 3M2H acids. Threshold detection determines human presence in the vicinity of the system . In various exemplary embodiments the chemical analyzer may be any of an ion mobility spectroscope a gas chromatograph a gas chromatograph plus a mass spectroscope or a flame ionization spectroscope. All of these analyzers are available as commercial off the shelf COTS devices.

A person within the detector s vicinity releases VOC molecules into the ambient air . A fan within the convection portion drives the air with molecules towards the chamber . The molecules in the air enter the inlet portion and pass through a filter disposed within the filter portion .

The filter may include an electrode circuit to sense changes in filter capacitance conductance and or light emission. Such physical characteristics are affected for detection by the electrode circuit only when the filter is saturated with 3H3MH and or 3M2H acids whereupon the communicator transmits the wireless signal to a remote receiver not shown for intrusion and or threat assessment. The wireless signal represents a radio signal within the electromagnetic spectrum such as but not limited to radio microwave and infrared frequencies.

In various exemplary embodiments the filter may include memory polymers such as polyacrylamide. Such memory polymers can be produced via electrospinning techniques. By judiciously incorporating selected chemical additives or dopants to the polymer liquid prior to being electrospun the filter can respond to the binding of 3H3MH and or 3M2H acids by changes in electrical conductance and or electrical capacitance.

Dopants for enabling such property change detection by the electrode include electrically conductive metal nanoparticles particles whose diameter is less than 100 nanometers such as gold silver or copper and or electro conductive polymers such as polyanilline. Alternatively in response to binding with the molecules the filter can emit visible light in response to the VOC binding. Dopants for enabling such light emission by the filter include any semi conducting material such as doped silicon. The light may provide a visual indication of threshold quantities of the molecules for further investigation. The light may be transmitted to an eye piece or through fiber optics to a remote monitoring station or be used to trigger a radiofrequency signal by wireless transmission.

In various exemplary embodiments the filter may be exchanged with another filter after the initially installed filter becomes saturated or to select an alternate particle size for transmission. The filter may be connected to a tray or carrousel having a series of filters . The tray may rotate about a carrousel center as shown to exchange filters mounted on spokes and or connected along a rim . Alternatively the tray may translate as a conveyor belt to exchange filters . The filter may be inserted through a slot within the filter portion .

The chemical analyzer receives and analyzes the molecules at step to determine at step whether threshold quantities of 3H3MH and or 3M2H acids are present. Upon such chemical detection the communicator transmits the signal at step to indicate presence of the person . Otherwise or at the conclusion of signal transmission the process terminates at step .

Upon such electrical detection the communicator transmits the signal at step to indicate presence of the person . After reaching VOC molecular saturation the filter can changed at step . In the absence of such detection at step or at the conclusion of signal transmission the process terminates at step .

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
