The content extraction server comprises a RSS aggregator a content aggregator and a content transcoder and preferably comprises an update scheduler the database and a display module . The RSS aggregator collects the update content New con consisting of the RSS feed provided from the at least one content server. The update content New con should be manufactured based on an XML that provides the RSS feed and supports the RSS. When t the update content New con supports the RSS the RSS aggregator connects to the content server to collect the update content New con including the RSS feed that supports the RSS provided form the content server. In order to achieve this the RSS aggregator establishes a communication channel with the content server. The communication channel may be adaptively established for the Internet connected via a network a wireless network connected via wireless LANs a ubiquitous network connected via a ubiquitous. The RSS aggregator may be manufactured to be synchronized to the content server and the RSS aggregator may be distributed directly by the content server or distributed by a separate storing device. In addition the RSS aggregator collects the update content New con and classifies the same into a suitable form. The RSS aggregator may support an entire versions of the RSS and an ATOM currently released in order to convert the update content New con into mobiles contents Mobil con Mobil con and so on. The RSS aggregator may carry out a function of configuring and changing an applied format for each of RSS channels a function of storing an entire element of a RSS file provided by the content server and a function of storing a linked binary in case of a RSS file including an enclosure. In addition the RSS aggregator defines a RSS pattern to be substantially used according to a constitution of the element and collects the RSS feed by a unit of a second according to an assignment of the administrator while minimizing a load.

The content aggregator classifies and recognizes the collected update content New con into a plurality of content patterns Pat con Pat con and so on and partially extracts and stores a tag included in the content patterns Pat con Pat con and so on according to a requirement and a characteristic of a receiving terminal. The tag includes the updated content and may include only a title and a content. The content may include an image a video an audio a text and so on. It is preferable that the content aggregator satisfies conditions below while extracting the content from the collected RSS feed. That is the content aggregator may extract an effective content from an original html of the RSS feed to be stored in the database . The original html the effective content and the RSS file may be stored. The content aggregator subdivides the pattern to prevent an issue during operation due to a pattern application simplifies the pattern application and prevents a manual pattern application wherein an administrator collects the content by dragging from the RSS feed so as to provide an automatic collection for the content collection.

A process for extracting analyzing and classifying the pattern using the content aggregator will now be described with reference to . Referring to the content aggregator analyzes the RSS feed of the update content New con collected from the content server by the RSS aggregator S .

In the step S the original html is collected from the content server providing the update content New con through a permalink when the description field exists S .

In the step S an inspection whether a content identical to the RSS description field exists in the collected original html is carried out S .

In the step S the content of the description field is classified as the first content pattern Pat con when a content identical to the RSS description field exists in the collected original html S .

In the step S an inspection whether the RSS feed includes a RSS title field is carried out when the description field does not exists S .

In the step S an inspection whether the RSS title is included in the original html is carried out when the RSS feed includes the RSS title field S .

In the step S when the original html includes the RSS title the content is extracted is based on a position of the RSS title and the extracted content is classified as the second content pattern Pat con S .

In the step S an inspection whether an html tag is included in the RSS description field is carried out when content identical to the RSS description field does not exist in the collected original html S .

In the step S when the html tag is included in the RSS description field the html tag is removed from the original html S and the step S is carried out when the html tag is not included in the RSS description field.

When the RSS title field does not exists in the step S and S respectively a tag value is scored using a tag scoring module S .

The tag scoring module scores for a characteristic of each tag included in the original html according to various predetermined conditions so as to generate scores corresponding to each tag.

Thereafter an inspection whether the score calculated by the tag scoring module is more than a predetermined value is carried out S .

In the step S when the score of the tag is more than the predetermined value the corresponding tag is defined as the content and is classified as the third content pattern Pat con S .

In the step S when the score of the tag is no more than the predetermined value the administrator of the content extraction server defines the pattern and classifies the same as the fourth content pattern Pat con S .

The first through the fourth patterns Pat con Pat con Pat con and Pat con will be described with reference to .

The content transcoder converts the tag extracted from each of the content patterns Pat con Pat con Pat con and Pat con classified by the content aggregator into mobile contents Mobil con Mobil con and so on. Specifically the mobile contents Mobil con Mobil con require different mobile content formats according to a characteristic of a corresponding mobile device. For instance the data formats sizes and amounts of the mobile contents Mobil con Mobil con and so on differ according to various characteristics of the terminal such as a size of an LCD a type of a memory a compatibility characteristic and a display capability depending on a specification of the terminal. In order to satisfy a diversity of the different mobile contents Mobil con Mobil con and so on formats according to the data formats the sizes and the amounts of the mobile contents Mobil con Mobil con and so on that may be applied to various mobile communication terminals are obtained in advance and the tag extracted from the first through the fourth patterns Pat con Pat con Pat con and Pat con are converted to various mobile contents Mobil con Mobil con and so on. The various converted mobile contents Mobil con Mobil con and so on may be stored in the database . On the other hand when the user terminal requests a content that does not comply with the predetermined size and the data format the content transcoder reads the update content New con stored in the database to be converted to the mobile content that has a new size and data format. In order to achieve this the content transcoder may store the update content New con collected by the content aggregator in its original format without a conversion or the tag extracted from the update content New con in its original format.

In the step when the specification requested by the user terminal complies with the predetermined size and the data format an additional process is not required. The content providing server for providing an information to the user terminal transmits the content requested by the user i.e. the mobile content Mobil con complying with the corresponding specification stored in the database to the user terminal S .

In the step when the specification requested by the user terminal does not exists in the predetermined size and the data format the content providing server provides a new user request specification to the content transcoder and the content transcoder generates a new mobile content Mobil con that complies with the new user request specification based on the original update content New con or the original tag stored in the database S .

The update scheduler controls a point of time of receiving the update content by the RSS aggregator . More specifically the RSS aggregator establishes a communication channel with the content server at a time designated by the update scheduler and collects the update content New con through the established communication center. The RSS aggregator may collect the update content New con from the content server periodically or when the update content New con is generated in the content server or at a designated time for example when the mobile communication terminal is activated.

The database stores the update content New con collected from the content server by the content extraction server to be classified analyzed and converted from the classified the mobile content into the mobile contents Mobil con Mobil con and so on that is applicable to the mobile terminal. The mobile content Mobil con includes a title representing a content title a image according to a size definition and a corresponding content describing the content. In addition the database may store the original update content New con and the original tag collected from the update content New con separately.

Referring to the first content pattern Pat con is a pattern wherein the description field is a starting point of the content. That is when the content of the description field of the RSS feed is identical to that of the description field in the original html the description field is recognized and stored as the content. At this time the description field is stored as the content after searching a higher rank table and deleting a html tag.

Referring to when a content of a title field is identical to that of the original html a main content below the title field may be determined as the second content pattern Pat con considering various types of table structures. That is since a structure of a cell distributed at the table may be represented as various types as shown in a content region disposed below the title is extracted from each tag centered at the title. While illustrates a case that the title and the content are arranged horizontally the title and the content may be arranged in various ways such as a horizontal arrangement a combination of vertical and horizontal arrangement and a diagonal arrangement.

Referring to the third content pattern Pat con is defined by analyzing the tags to provide a score to each of the tags wherein a corresponding text is determined as the content when a total is more than a predetermined value. More specifically in accordance with the third content pattern Pat con as shown a predetermined score is granted when a width of the tag is the largest excluding the title portion by analyzing a table structure and a predetermined score is added when the text is written in a predetermined font and has a size larger than a predetermined size. The score of each of the tags is compared and when the tag has a score more than a predetermined value the tag is recognized and stored as the third content pattern Pat con.

Referring to in accordance with the fourth content pattern Pat con when the update content New con does not belong to the first content pattern Pat con the second content pattern Pat con and the third content pattern Pat con the administrator of the content extraction server may designate the tag directly extract the tag and store the extracted tag in the database . Specifically the fourth content pattern Pat con employs a scheme wherein the tag of a portion dragged by the administrator from the update content New con generates the pattern for the corresponding content server and the pattern for the corresponding content server already generated when the content for the corresponding content server is collected is applied. To summarize the fourth content pattern Pat con is defined by defining the content included in the update content New con as a new predetermined pattern and extracting the content from the content server according to the defined pattern.

Thereafter the RSS feed is classified into the four content patterns Pat con Pat con Pat con and Pat con and the tag is partially extracted from the classified four content patterns Pat con Pat con Pat con and Pat con.

Thereafter the content transcoder converts the tag extracted by the content aggregator to the user content the mobile content Mobil con Mobil con and so on for example so as to be applicable to a mobile size S .

Thereafter the update scheduler determines the point of time at which the RSS aggregator collects the RSS feed from the content server S .

Finally the user content converted by the content transcoder i.e. the mobile content Mobil con Mobil con and so on is stored in the content transcoder .

On the other hand while converting the update content New con to the mobile content Mobil con Mobil con and so on by the content transcoder so as to be applicable to the mobile is described the update content New con may be converted to the user content that is applicable to various communication terminals.
