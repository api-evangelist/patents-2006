A statistical hidden trajectory model uses temporal filtering of hidden vocal tract resonance targets to estimate a hidden trajectory for a vocal tract resonance. The targets used in the hidden trajectory model are described as being stochastic with a phoneme dependent probability distribution. Thus each phoneme has a mean target and a target variance. In the past the mean target and the target variance have been determined using a vocal tract resonance tracker.

Using the tracker hidden trajectory values for individual phonemes are collected and the statistical distribution of the vocal tract resonances is used to identify the means and variances for the targets. Because the vocal tract resonance tracker is not perfect errors in the vocal tract resonances identified by the tracker are propagated into the target distributions. As a result the target distributions are incorrect resulting in poor performance of the hidden trajectory model.

A hidden trajectory model is a two stage model that provides a probability of an observation vector given a speech unit such as a phoneme. In the first stage of the model a probability distribution for vocal tract resonance VTR trajectories is described in terms of a filtered sequence of vocal tract resonance VTR target distributions. In the second stage of the hidden trajectory model the probability of an observation vector is described in terms of a non linear function of the vocal tract resonance trajectory and a residual model.

Under one embodiment the first stage of the hidden trajectory model describes the vocal tract resonance trajectory as being generated from segmental targets applied to a bi directional finite impulse response filter as 

Under one embodiment the speech unit dependent target vector tin EQ. 1 is assumed to be a random vector with a Gaussian distribution EQ. 2 where is the mean of the target vector and is the variance of the target vector which in many embodiments is assumed to be diagonal. Under one embodiment the model tracts the frequency and bandwidth of four vocal tract resonances. Under such an embodiment the mean contains eight components such that ffffbbbb where frepresents a target frequency and brepresents a corresponding target bandwidth for a vocal tract resonance.

Due to the linearity between z and t shown in EQ. 1 the assumption that the target vector is a Gaussian leads to the VTR trajectory also being a Gaussian such that EQ. 3

Combining EQS. 1 2 and 3 the mean vector of the Gaussian distribution for the vocal tract resonance trajectory z k is derived as 

The relationship between the VTR trajectory distributions and the target vector distributions is shown in for a single vocal tract resonance frequency. In time is shown along horizontal axis and frequency is shown along vertical axis .

Based on the bi directional filtering of EQ. 4 the mean for the vocal tract resonance trajectory follows the path and has a variance as indicated by the vertical distance between upper band and lower band .

There is no explicit expression for the filter parameter vector ain EQ. 4 as the vector depends on constituents and ordering of the phones units in each of the training utterances. One way to represent each ais by way of construction. It can be constructed based on the ordering and identity of the phones in the phone or unit sequence in the speech utterance. Specifically each ais generated based on an alignment of training speech frames with text expressed in terms of phone like unit. It is worth noting that the alignment can be obtained either from the training data or from the alignment results of a baseline HMM system. This alignment indicates which target means and smoothing parameters are used to determine the current trajectory mean in EQ. 4. Using these alignments the values of acan be determined through an algorithm. For example if instead of using 58 speech units 5 speech units were used such that 

Approximating the covariance matrix by a diagonal matrix for each speech unit l the elements of the diagonal are represented a vector EQ. 8 where the target covariance matrix is also approximated as diagonal 

Note that in EQS. 6 and 10 aand are frame dependent k vectors that are both a function of the speech unit identities and temporal orders in the utterance but that are independent of the vocal tract resonance dimension f.

The second stage of the Hidden Trajectory Model provides a probabilistic mapping from the stochastic Vocal Tract Resonance trajectory z k to a stochastic observation trajectory o k such that the mapping provides the probability of an observed vector given a hidden trajectory value. Under one embodiment the observation trajectory takes the form of LPC cepstra and the mapping uses a non linear prediction function F z k and a Gaussian residual model where and are the mean and covariance respectively of the residual model. The residual model vector can be expressed as 

The residual model vector can be modeled as a Gaussian parameterized by residual mean vector and covariance matrix .

For computational tractability it is desirable to linearize the non linear function F z k . Under one embodiment this is accomplished using a first order Taylor series expansion such that F EQ. 13 where F z k is the derivative of F z k with respect to a VTR dimension such that 

Substituting 13 into 11 an approximate conditional acoustic observation probability can be obtained where the mean vector is expressed as a linear function of the VTR vector z r EQ. 16 where EQ. 17

One aspect of the HTM is its ability to provide a likelihood value for a sequence of acoustic observation vectors o k in the form of cepstral parameters. The computed likelihood provides a natural scoring mechanism comparing different linguistic hypotheses as needed in speech recognition. No VTR values z k are needed in this computation as they are treated as hidden variables. The values are marginalized i.e. integrated over in the likelihood computation. Given the model construction and the approximation described above the HTM likelihood computation by marginalization can be carried out in a closed form. The final result of the computation is as follows 

To facilitate the development of the parameter learning algorithms for VTR targets distributional parameters diagonality of the prediction cepstral residual s covariance matrix can be assumed. Denoting its j th component by j j 1 2 . . . J the multivariate Gaussian of equation 18 can be decomposed element by element into 

Parameter learning algorithms can be used for the HTM to learn parameters of the model namely mean and covariance matrices for the cepstral residual model and mean and covariance matrices for the VTR targets. In learning cepstral observation data can be used as the training set. The criterion used for this learning is to maximize the observation likelihood in equation 20.

This subset of the HTM parameters consists of 1 the mean vectors and 2 the diagonal elements in the covariance matrices of the cepstral prediction residuals. Both of these parameters are conditioned on phone or sub phone s.

where p o k s is given by equation 20 and K denotes the total duration of sub phone s in the training data. This gives 

Denote the diagonal elements of the covariance matrices for the residuals as a vector . To derive the ML estimate the following equation can be used 

Due to frame k dependency of the denominator in equation 23 no simple closed form solution is available for solving from equation 23. Different techniques can be used for seeking approximate ML estimates.

Frame independent approximation Assume the dependency of q k on time frame k is mild or q k . Then the denominator in equation 23 can be cancelled yielding the approximate closed form estimate of 

Using a chain rule a new gradient tilde over L is related to the gradient L before parameter transformation in a simple manner 

At the end of algorithm iterations the parameters are transformed via exp tilde over which is guaranteed to be positive. For efficiency purposes parameter updating in the above gradient ascent techniques can be carried out after each utterance in training rather than after an entire batch of all utterances.

Among the three techniques above the first one can be faster but gives a slightly lower performance than the other two techniques which can be computationally more expensive. The second technique can occasionally cause poor training when the variance estimate becomes negative. To avoid the negative variance estimates careful setting of the learning rate. The third technique is robust against the above problem but can be used slower than the first technique while comparable to the second one in computation.

This subset of the HTM parameters consists of 1 the mean vectors and 2 the diagonal elements in the covariance matrices of the stochastic segmental VTR targets. They also are conditioned on phone segment s.

Optimizing the log likelihood function of equation 20 with respect to the joint parameter set i.e. including each phone indexed by l and each of the vector component indexed by f in l f results in a large full rank linear system of equations.

In step a speech signal generated by a trainer reading from a text is received by an analog to digital A D converter . At step the speech signal is converted into observed feature vectors by converting the analog signal into digital samples using A D converter forming frames of digital samples using frame constructor and forming a feature vector for each frame using feature extractor . In one embodiment A D converter samples the analog speech signal at 16 kHz with 16 bits per sample thereby creating 32 kilobytes of speech data per second and frame constructor creates a new frame every 10 milliseconds that includes 25 milliseconds worth of data. Under one embodiment feature extractor extracts Linear Predictive Coding cepstral feature vectors which are well known in the art.

At step observed feature vectors are aligned with speech units by a Hidden Markov Model HMM alignment unit . HMM alignment unit uses a dictionary not shown to divide text into speech units. It then aligns the sequence of observed feature vectors with the speech units using a Hidden Markov Model not shown which describes the probability of each speech unit given the sequence of observed feature vectors . This results in an alignment which associates feature vectors and thereby the frames associated with the feature vectors with speech units in the training speech signal.

The process of continues at step where cepstral residual means learned by residual model trainer . As noted above the cepstral residual means are determined using the equations presented above and alignment . Once cepstral residual means have been learned the process continues at step where the cepstral residual variances are learned using residual model trainer . The variances are learned based on equations above and a residual model is output.

At step VTR target means are learned by a VTR target trainer using equations above. At step VTR target variances are learned using VTR target trainer and equations above. A VTR model is then output for use in a speech recognition system.
