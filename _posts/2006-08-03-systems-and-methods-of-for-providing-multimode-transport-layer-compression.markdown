The present invention generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present invention relates to systems and methods for transmitting compressed and uncompressed content to a client via the same transport layer connection.

During network communications between a client and a server some compression aware browsers are provided with compressed data such as compressed HyperText Markup Language HTML data. However some browsers have problems handling some content in compressed form. For example the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser is designed to handle compressed rich text formatted content or compressed Microsoft PowerPoint content while other browsers are not. In one case some versions of the browser plugin Macromedia FlashPlayer not handle compressed plain text. In another case some versions of the Netscape browser do not handle compressed java script. In another example some browsers do not handle compressed KHTML which is the HTML produced from the open source KHTML engine. In yet another example some browsers do not handle compressed cascading style sheets CSS such as Netscape version 4.0.

One way to solve compression issues with a browser is to not compress content for certain types of browsers. However this has the undesirable effect of not obtaining the benefits of compression such as to accelerate communications between a client and a server or to improve the response time to a user. By foregoing compressing of content transmitted to the browser the opportunity to accelerate communications by compressing large content is missed. The uncompressed large content may slow down network communications or impact the user s experience in viewing or interacting with the content.

It would therefore be desirable to provide systems and methods to transmit both compressed and uncompressed content to a client.

The present invention provides a solution to transmitting compressed and uncompressed content to an application in a manner independent to the compression capabilities of the appliance. The appliance described herein provides for the transmission of compressed and uncompressed content over the same transport layer connection between a client and a server. The appliance transmits compressed content to a client agent which decompresses the content and provides the uncompressed content to an application on the client. The appliance can accelerate or otherwise improve the speed of delivery of content or the transmission of network communications between a client and server in a manner not dependent on the compression capabilities or compression awareness of the application on the client and or the application on the server. Additionally the appliance can apply one of a plurality of compression techniques to network communications based on a compression policy and or information associated with the communication such as IP layer information protocol or content or type of object of the communications.

In one aspect the present invention is related to a method for communicating compressed and uncompressed content over a transport layer connection established by an appliance between a client and a server. The method includes establishing by an appliance a transport layer connection between a client and a server. The appliance receives a first response from the server to a first client request and a second response from the server to a second client request. The first response and the second response include uncompressed data. The appliance transmits the first response to the client. The method includes identifying by the appliance a first type of compression from a plurality of compression types for compressing the second response to the client compressing the second response based on the identified compression type and transmitting the compressed second response to the client.

In one embodiment the method includes determining by the appliance a type of object included in one of the first response or the second response. In another embodiment the method includes identifying by the appliance the type of compression for compressing the second response based on the type of object. In some embodiments the method includes configuring via the appliance a rule identifying the type of compression associated with the type of object. In other embodiments the appliance identifies the type of compression for compressing the second response based on a protocol of the second response. In another embodiment the appliance identifies the type of compression for compressing the second response based on a compression policy. In some embodiments the type of compression includes one of the following a gzip compression a deflate compression and a delta compression.

In other embodiments the method includes identifying by the appliance for a third response to the client a second type of compression from the plurality of compression types compressing the third response based on the second type of compression and transmitting the compressed third response to the client. In another embodiments the method includes identifying by the appliance for a third response to a second client a second type of compression from the plurality of compression types compressing the third response based on the second type of compression and transmitting the compressed third response to the second client.

In one embodiment the method establishes by the appliance a Secure Socket Layer SSL session via the transport layer connection between the client and the server. In another embodiment the method includes accelerating by the appliance transmission of one of the first response or the compressed second response using one or more of the following techniques Transport Control Protocol TCP connection pooling TCP connection multiplexing TCP buffering and caching.

In yet another example the appliance may apply a third compression type to one of the responses from server to client . The appliance may determine the compression type or not to compress based on the object content or type in the response or request. On a per request and on per response basis the appliance may apply one of a plurality of compression types to the communication which may include not compressing the communication. In one embodiment the appliance transmits both compressed and decompressed responses via the same transport layer connection to the client .

Referring now to steps of an embodiment of a method for practicing multi mode compression techniques is depicted. In brief overview at step the client agent establishes a connection with the appliance such as a transport layer connection. At step the appliance receives a response from the server to a request of the client . The response may comprise decompressed data or data already compressed. At step the appliance determines whether to compress the received response. If the appliance decides to not compress the response the appliance at step transmits the response to the client without performing a compression. If the appliance decides to compress the response the appliance at step identifies one compression type from a plurality of compression types . For example the appliance selects a compression type based on a compression policy . At step the appliance compresses the response based on the identified compression type and at step transmits the compressed response to the client agent . At step the client agent decompresses the compressed response and provides the decompressed content to an application such as a web browser.

In further detail at step the client agent establishes a transport layer connection with the appliance such as via the transport control protocol or user datagram protocol.

At step the appliance receives a response from the server to a request of the client . In one embodiment the appliance intercepts the response from the server during transmission to the client . In other embodiments the server transmits the response to the appliance to forward to the client . In some embodiments the server transmits the response in response to a request from a client . In other embodiments the server transmits the response asynchronously to the client .

In one embodiment the response from the server comprises decompressed data. In another embodiment the response from the server comprises compressed data. In some embodiments the response from the server comprises compressed and decompressed data.

At step the appliance and or multi mode compression engine determines whether to compress the response received or intercepted from the server . The appliance may determine to compress or not to compress based on any information related to the response such as content protocol source and destination information. In one embodiment the appliance such as via the multi mode compression engine inspects or analyzes the content of the response for one or more objects . In some embodiments the appliance determines the type or content of the object . In other embodiments the appliance determines if the response is already compressed or has any compressed portions.

In some embodiments the appliance determines from any network or IP layer information such as destination and or source IP address or destination and or source port whether to compress the response.

If the appliance decides not to compress the response the appliance at step transmits the response to the client without performing a compression. In one embodiment the appliance determines the response is already compressed. In another embodiment the appliance determines the response is decompressed and based on the type of object a compression policy indicates the response should not be compressed by the appliance . For example the compression policy may indicate if the response is shorter than a predetermined length then the response should not be compressed. In another example the compression policy may indicate if the response comprises binary data from an application that the response should not be compressed. In another embodiment the appliance determines not to compress the response based on tracking compression statistics on responses based on the content or type of object or based on compressibility statistics of responses from the server or service . For example if the compressibility of responses from the server do not meet a predetermined compressibility threshold over time the appliance may not continue compressing responses from that server .

At step in some embodiments the appliance decides to compress the response. In one embodiment the appliance and or multi mode compression engine determines the content or type of object of the response can be compressed into a size meeting a predetermined compressibility threshold. In some embodiments the appliance decides to compress the response based on a compression policy indicating that the content or type of object should be compressed by the appliance . In another embodiment a compression policy indicates to compress responses from the server or service . In one embodiment the appliance decides to compress the response based on a compression policy indicating that the response should be compressed based on the protocol or type of protocol used by the response.

Further to step in one embodiment the appliance such as via the multi mode compression engine identifies one compression type from a plurality of compression types for compressing the response. For example the appliance selects a compression type based on a compression policy . In some embodiments the appliance selects a compression type based on the content or type of object the protocol or type of protocol used by the response or the network or IP layer identified by the response. In another embodiment the client and or client agent identifies to the appliance the compression type to use for responses transmitted to the client . In yet another embodiment the appliance selects the compression type based on the selection type used for a previous response. In some embodiments the appliance selects the compression type based on attributes of the client and or server . In one embodiment the appliance selects the compression type based on the type of protocol used in the response or between the client and server . In some embodiments the appliance selects a first compression type for a first object of the response and a second compression type for a second object of the response.

At step the appliance such as via multi mode compression engine compresses the response based on the identified or selected compression type . In one embodiment the appliance compresses the entire payload of the transport layer packet using the selected compression type . In another embodiment the appliance compresses a portion of the payload of the response using the selected compression type . In some embodiments the appliance compresses an object of the response using the selected compression type . In yet another embodiment the appliance compresses a first object and a second object of the response with the selected compression type . In some embodiments the appliance compresses a first object of the response with a first selected compression type and a second object of the response with a second selected compression type .

At step the appliance transmits the compressed response to the client agent or client . In one embodiment the appliance transmits a plurality of responses in a compressed form to the client agent . In other embodiments the appliance transmits each response separately in a compressed form to the client agent . In some embodiments the appliance transmits the type of compression to the client agent . In one embodiment the appliance identifies the compression type via the payload of the compressed response. In another embodiment the appliance identifies the compression type via a communication over the transport layer connection to the client agent or via an out of band or other communication channel to the client agent .

At step the client agent decompresses the compressed response and provides the decompressed content to an application such as a web browser. In one embodiment the client agent decompresses the compressed response upon receipt. In other embodiments the client agent decompresses the compressed response upon receiving a predetermined number of responses or a predetermined quantity of data via the response. In one embodiment the client agent decompresses the entire response. In some embodiments the client agent decompresses a portion of the response. In another embodiment the client agent decompresses each compressed object of the response. In some embodiments the client agent provides the decompressed content of the response via the network stack of the client . In other embodiments the client agent communicates the decompressed response or content thereof via an application programming interface or function call. In yet another embodiment the client agent provides the compressed response to the application of the client and the application decompresses the content.

In some embodiments the client agent transparently to an application or user of the client receives the compressed response decompresses the compressed response and provides the decompressed response to the application. For example in one embodiment the application such as a web browser may not support the compression type used by the appliance to compress the response. With the client agent the application may receive the decompressed content although the application may have not otherwise recognized the compressed content. As such in some embodiment the client agent and appliance perform compression on responses to accelerate delivery of the response in a manner transparent or non intrusive to the application.

Although an embodiment of method is generally described above in view of responses from a server to a client the method in some embodiments may be used to compress requests from the client to the server . For example a client may transmit to the server a request comprising one or more objects . The multi mode compression engine may determine to compress the request or these objects and select a compression type based on a compression policy or information identified via the request such as protocol type or content of object or any network or IP related information. The appliance may compress the request using the determined or selected compression type and then transmit the compresses request to a server . Furthermore method may be practiced bi directionally for both requests and responses to provide compression to and from a client or to and from a server . As such in one embodiment the multi mode compression technique of the appliance may be used to transmit both compressed and uncompressed content via the same transport layer connection in a manner transparent to an application on the client and or service on the server .

Additionally the method may be practiced so that the appliance may apply different compression types to each client and or server . For example the appliance may compress content for a first client using a first and or second compression type and for a second client using a second and or third compression type. In another example the appliance may compress responses from a first server using a first compression type and may compresses responses from a second server using a second or third compression type . The method may also be practiced so that the appliance used different compression techniques for the same clients and or servers at different times. For example the appliance may compress a first response from a first server using a first compression type and then may compress a subsequent response from the first server using a second compression type . In some embodiments the compression policy may be changed dynamically or on the fly to apply a different compression type to a network communication compressed by the appliance .

In view of the structure function and operations of the appliance and client agent described herein the multi mode compression engine and technique provides for the transmission of compressed and uncompressed content over the same transport layer connection between a client and a server . The appliance and or client agent can accelerate or otherwise improve the speed of delivery of content or the transmission of network communications between a client and server in a manner not dependent on the compression capabilities or compression awareness of the application on the client and or the application on the server . Additionally the appliance can apply one of a plurality of compression techniques to network communications based on a compression policy and or information associated with the communication such as IP layer information protocol or content or type of object of the communications. In this manner the appliance can apply a better more desired or more suitable compression technique to the communication which in turn may help further accelerate the delivery of the communication.
