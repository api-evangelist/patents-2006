The invention relates generally to machine vision inspection systems and more particularly to video metrology tool modes and tools usable to define inspection operations for such systems.

Precision machine vision inspection systems or vision systems for short can be utilized to obtain precise dimensional measurements of inspected objects and to inspect various other object characteristics. Such systems may include a computer a camera and optical system and a precision stage that is movable in multiple directions so as to allow the camera to scan the features of a workpiece that is being inspected. One exemplary prior art system that is commercially available is the QUICK VISION series of PC based vision systems and QVPAK software available from Mitutoyo America Corporation MAC located in Aurora Ill. The features and operation of the QUICK VISION series of vision systems and the QVPAK software are generally described for example in the 3 published January 2003 and the 3 published September 1996 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. This product as exemplified by the QV 302 Pro model for example is able to use a microscope type optical system to provide images of a workpiece at various magnifications and move the stage as necessary to traverse the workpiece surface beyond the limits of any single video image. A single video image typically encompasses only a portion of the workpiece being observed or inspected given the desired magnification measurement resolution and physical size limitations of such systems.

Machine vision inspection systems generally utilize automated video inspection. U.S. Pat. No. 6 542 180 the 180 patent teaches various aspects of such automated video inspection and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As taught in the 180 patent automated video inspection metrology instruments generally have a programming capability that allows an automatic inspection event sequence to be defined by the user for each particular workpiece configuration. This can be implemented by text based programming for example or through a recording mode which progressively learns the inspection event sequence by storing a sequence of machine control instructions corresponding to a sequence of inspection operations performed by a user or through a combination of both methods. Such a recording mode is often referred to as learn mode or training mode. Once the inspection event sequence is defined in learn mode such a sequence can then be used to automatically acquire and additionally analyze or inspect images of a workpiece during run mode. 

The machine control instructions including the specific inspection event sequence i.e. how to acquire each image and how to analyze inspect each acquired image are generally stored as a part program or workpiece program that is specific to the particular workpiece configuration. For example a part program defines how to acquire each image such as how to position the camera relative to the workpiece at what lighting level at what magnification level etc. Further the part program defines how to analyze inspect an acquired image for example by using one or more video tools such as edge boundary detection video tools.

Video tools or tools for short may be used manually to accomplish manual inspection and or machine control operations. Their set up parameters and operation can also be recorded during learn mode in order to create automatic inspection programs or part programs. Such tools may include for example edge boundary detection tools autofocus tools shape or pattern matching tools dimension measuring tools and the like. For example such tools are routinely used in a variety of commercially available machine vision inspection systems such as the QUICK VISION series of vision systems and the associated QVPAK software discussed above.

The currently available features and graphical user interface GUI controls for video tools and particularly dimensional metrology video tools are limited. In particular alternatives for setting up video tool regions of interest ROIs and operating parameters during learn mode or manual mode are limited. Existing alternatives may be difficult to adapt for efficient use with different applications or workpieces. Existing user interfaces may be difficult for users to understand intuitively making user learning and retention difficult. Video tools that overcome these and other disadvantages to allow more efficient intuitive and flexible use of precision machine vision inspection systems would be desirable.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Currently the users of precision machine vision inspection systems may spend a majority of their part programming time setting up video tools and adjusting their parameters. Thus even small improvements in their ease of use in comparison to their parameter customization capability their GUI features and other ergonomic factors may be highly valued. One type of video tool a so called arc tool for measuring the characteristics of arc shaped features in images may have more controllable parameters than a variety of other video tools. Arc tool customization has been inconvenient and non intuitive especially for large and small arc radii. Accordingly the present invention is directed toward novel and efficient features for configuring an arc video tool in an easy to use and flexible manner.

A system and method are provided which allow users to define and or edit tool parameters for an arc tool ROI with a relatively reduced number of operations. In particular a unique combination of arc tool user interface features and operations are provided for efficiently editing an arc tool ROI. In accordance with one aspect of the invention a plurality of distinct types of ROI parameter control features are provide in an arc tool GUI. In one embodiment there may be at least four such distinct types of ROI control parameter features. The distinct types of ROI parameter control features may be distinguished by their locations relative to the ROI and or each other and or by distinct symbols or the like.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention each distinct type of ROI parameter control feature may be associated with a distinct mode of operation that is specific to that type of ROI parameter control feature. In accordance with a further aspect of the invention activating such a distinct mode of operation may be associated with displaying a corresponding unique mode symbol cursor. In one embodiment each of the distinct modes of operation may be activated by an identical activation operation for each of the distinct types of ROI parameter control features. In one embodiment the identical activation operation comprises hovering a default cursor over a distinct type of ROI parameter control feature until a unique mode symbol cursor is displayed then activating the corresponding editing mode by depressing the left mouse button while the unique mode symbol cursor is displayed.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention one distinct mode of operation that is specific to a first type of ROI parameter control feature is a curvature changing mode wherein moving a curvature changing mode symbol cursor along a radial direction causes the nominal radius of curvature of the inner and outer radii of the ROI to mutually decrease or mutually increase depending on the direction of the radial movement of the curvature changing mode symbol cursor. In various embodiments the curvature changing mode operates such that the end portions of the ROI retain their original length and pivot about their midpoints as the nominal radius of curvature changes. In various embodiments when the difference between the start and stop angles of an ROI is approximately 180 degrees or more the curvature changing mode is disabled for that ROI. In various embodiments the corresponding first type of ROI parameter control feature comprises an editing handle located approximately at the midpoint of at least one of the inner radius boundary of the ROI and the outer radius boundary of the ROI. In one embodiment the curvature changing mode symbol cursor may comprise two arc shaped lines and at least one arrow oriented transverse to the arc shaped lines.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention one distinct mode of operation that is specific to a second type of ROI parameter control feature is a symmetrical radial dimension changing mode wherein moving a symmetrical radial dimension changing mode symbol cursor along a radial direction causes the nominal radius of curvature of the ROI outer radius to increase while the nominal radius of curvature of the ROI inner radius simultaneous decreases by the same amount or vice versa depending on the direction of the radial movement of the symmetrical radial dimension changing mode symbol cursor. In one embodiment the symmetrical radial dimension changing mode operates such that the end portions of the ROI retain their original angles and midpoints as the nominal radius of curvature changes.

In accordance with a further aspect of the invention one or more of the distinct types of ROI parameter control features may be associated with at least two modes of operation. One of the two modes of operation may be shared with at least one other distinct type of ROI parameter control feature. In one embodiment three distinct types of ROI parameter control features are located on each of the inner and outer radius boundaries of the ROI. Each of these distinct types of ROI parameter control features shares an in place ROI rotation mode of operation. In one embodiment the in place ROI rotation mode made be activated by an identical activation operation for each of these distinct types of ROI parameter control features. In one embodiment the identical activation operation comprises positioning a cursor on one of the distinct types of ROI parameter control features and depressing the right mouse button. In one embodiment a distinct mode cursor may change to a cursor corresponding to the shared mode that has been activated as a result of depressing the right mouse button.

It should be appreciated the selection of concepts outlined above is exemplary only and not limiting.

The vision measuring machine includes a moveable workpiece stage and an optical imaging system which may include a zoom lens or interchangeable lenses. The zoom lens or interchangeable lenses generally provide various magnifications for the images provided by the optical imaging system . The machine vision inspection system is generally comparable to the QUICK VISION series of vision systems and the QVPAK software discussed above and similar state of the art commercially available precision machine vision inspection systems. The machine vision inspection system is also described in copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 978 227 which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Various aspects of vision measuring machines and control systems are also described in more detail in copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 808 948 filed Mar. 25 2004 and Ser. No. 10 632 823 filed Aug. 4 2003 which are also hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. As previously indicated the users of such general purpose precision machine vision inspection systems are often occasional and or inexperienced users. Such users may spend a majority of their programming time refreshing their understanding of video tools setting up their ROIs adjusting their parameters etc. Thus even small improvements in the intuitiveness of their graphical user interface and or their overall ease of use in comparison to their parameter customization capability their user interface options and other ergonomic factors may be highly valued.

As shown in in various exemplary embodiments the control system portion includes a controller an input output interface a memory a workpiece program generator and executor and a power supply portion . It will be appreciated that each of these components as well as the additional components described below may be interconnected by one or more data control buses and or application programming interfaces or by direct connections between the various elements.

The input output interface includes an imaging control interface a motion control interface a lighting control interface and a lens control interface . The motion control interface includes a position control element and a speed acceleration control element . However it should be appreciated that in various exemplary embodiments such elements may be merged and or indistinguishable. The lighting control interface includes lighting control elements which control for example the selection power on off switch and strobe pulse timing if applicable for the various corresponding light sources of the machine vision inspection system such as the light sources and .

The memory includes an image file memory portion a workpiece program memory portion that may include one or more part programs or the like and a video tool portion . The video tool portion includes a video tool portion TOOL that typifies a plurality of other similar tool portions not shown which determine the GUI image processing operation etc. for each of the corresponding tools. The video tool portion also includes a region of interest generator that supports automatic semi automatic and or manual operations that define various ROIs that are operable in various video tools included in the video tool portion .

In particular in various embodiments according to this invention the video tool portion includes the arc tool portion which provides various operations and features as disclosed herein which define the arc tool user interface and or which are usable to determine the parameters for various specific instances of applying the arc tool operations to specific workpiece features as described in greater detail below.

In general the memory portion stores data usable to operate the vision system components portion to capture or acquire an image of the workpiece such that the acquired image of the workpiece has desired image characteristics. The memory portion further stores data usable to operate the machine vision inspection system to perform various inspection and measurement operations on the acquired images either manually or automatically and to output the results through the input output interface . The memory portion also contains data defining a graphical user interface operable through the input output interface .

The signal lines or busses and of the stage light the coaxial light and the surface light respectively are all connected to the input output interface . The signal line from the camera system and the signal line from the controllable motor are connected to the input output interface . In addition to carrying image data the signal line may carry a signal from the controller that initiates image acquisition.

One or more display devices and one or more input devices can also be connected to the input output interface . The display devices and input devices can be used to display a user interface which may include various graphical user interface GUI features that are usable to perform inspection operations and or to create and or modify part programs to view the images captured by the camera system and or to directly control the vision system components portion . In a fully automated system having a predefined part program or workpiece program the display devices and or the input devices may be omitted.

In various exemplary embodiments when a user utilizes the machine vision inspection system to create a workpiece image acquisition program for the workpiece the user generates workpiece program instructions either by explicitly coding the instructions automatically semi automatically or manually using a workpiece programming language or by generating the instructions by moving the machine vision inspection system through an image acquisition training sequence setting light levels and the like such that the workpiece program instructions capture the training sequence. This process is repeated for multiple images in a set of images that are to be captured. These instructions when executed will cause the machine vision inspection system to manipulate the workpiece stage and or the camera system at certain speed s such that a particular portion of the workpiece is within the field of view of the camera system and at a desired focus state for each of a set of images to be acquired.

Once a set of workpiece image acquisition instructions are defined the control system executes the instructions and commands the camera system to capture one or more images of the workpiece according to the instructions. The control system will then under control of the controller input the captured image s through the input output interface and store the captured image s in the memory . The controller may also display the captured images on the display device .

The control system portion is further usable to recall captured and stored workpiece inspection images to inspect and analyze workpiece features in such workpiece inspection images and to store and or output the inspection results. These analysis and inspection methods are typically embodied in various video tools included in the video tool portion of the memory including the arc tool portion . After the image inspection analysis operations using one or more of these video tools are completed the control system outputs the results of each analysis inspection operation to the input output interface for outputting to various display devices such as a video display printer and the like. The control system may also store the results of each inspection operation in the memory .

The FOV window includes one exemplary instance of an arc tool superimposed upon the workpiece image . The appearance of editing handles X indicates that the arc tool has been selected by a user for editing. In various embodiments when the user selects an arc tool ROI for editing e.g. by positioning a cursor in the tool ROI and clicking a left mouse button or the like editing handles X may be displayed or highlighted on the ROI boundary and or the user interface may automatically display an arc tool parameter dialog box such as the parameter dialog box described in greater detail below or an analogous dialog box.

For all the tabbed portions the Defaults button at the bottom restores the entries on the tabbed portions and to their default values the OK button accepts the current parameters and closes the arc tool parameter dialog box and the Cancel button returns all parameters to their state before the current editing sequence began and closes the dialog box .

As shown in the arc tool may include the ROI which is defined by a ROI boundary having portions comprising an inner radius in an outer radius out and first and second ends and at respective stop and start angles. Also shown are scan direction indicators and edge slope indicator sampling direction indicator and edge selector . The edge selector may be positioned by the user e.g. by dragging it to a desired position along the edge to define a typical portion of an edge. The actual edge profile at the location of the edge selector then provides the basis for defining specific edge profile intensity characteristics that aid in reliable edge detection. The scan direction indicators and may comprise arrowheads located along the end portions and as shown. The arrowheads are configured to point in the direction corresponding to the sequence that is to be used for the analysis of pixel intensity that is used for detecting the edge in an image. It is generally advantageous if the scan direction proceeds from the least textured or noisy side of an edge or boundary to the more noisy side of the edge. The edge slope indicator may generally be filled in an arc tool is trained to indicate whether the intensity rises or falls across an edge as described in greater detail below with reference to .

According to this invention various parameter ROI parameter control features may be of distinct types and or perform distinct operations depending on their locations. For example as shown in the arc tool may include a first type of editing handles which may be located near the middle of the outer radius out and inner radius in respectively. These editing handles may operate as described further below with reference to and also as described with reference to A C and . A second type of editing handles and maybe located near the middle of the end portions and . These editing handles may operate as described further below with reference to . A third type of editing handles may be located at the corners of the ROI boundary . In one embodiment the third type of editing handles may operate as described further below with reference to . A fourth type of editing handles may be located at two positions on each of the outer radius out and inner radius in inward from the corners of the ROI boundary . Stated another way they may be located between the first type of editing handles and the third type of editing handles . In one embodiment the fourth type of editing handles may operate as described further below with reference to .

In one embodiment according to this invention the different types of editing handles or more generally the different types of ROI parameter control features that perform distinct operations may be associated with corresponding distinct mode symbol cursors that are activated under certain conditions to become the cursor or mouse pointer in the FOV window . Various generic GUI operations e.g. a drag operation and or right mouse button click or the like may have a different result depending on the underlying type of ROI parameter control feature that is associated with the operation. For example a drag operation associated with a first distinct type of ROI parameter control feature may cause two opposing ROI boundaries to move in opposite directions while of a drag operation associated with a second distinct type of ROI parameter control feature may cause two opposing ROI boundaries change their radii of curvature by the same amount. In various embodiments a distinct mode symbol cursor may be displayed to cue the user regarding the type of ROI parameter control feature that is currently being used and or the specific result that may be expected from one of the generic GUI operations.

In various embodiments hovering with the default cursor or mouse pointer over a particular type of editing handle for a predefined time may cause the corresponding mode symbol cursor to replace the default cursor. Once such a mode symbol cursor is displayed the user may then actually activate the corresponding mode in order to perform the corresponding type of tool editing or modification operation. In various embodiments the mode is activated by the operator performing a mode triggering action e.g. clicking and or holding down the left mouse button after the mode symbol cursor has been displayed. shows one embodiment of a curvature changing mode symbol cursor that is associated with the first type of editing handles . In various embodiments the user may cause the curvature changing mode symbol cursor to be displayed by positioning the mouse cursor to hover over one of the editing handles or for a predefined time. In various embodiments the editing handles may disappear when a mode symbol cursor such as the curvature changing mode symbol cursor is displayed. Various curvature changing mode features and operations are described in greater detail with reference to FIGS. and A C.

This type of operation is advantageous for changing the radial dimension of the ROI while its centerline may remain properly located on or near an edge feature not shown that is centrally located in the ROI . Of course it should be appreciated that if the symmetrical radial dimension changing mode symbol cursor were dragged along the direction opposite to that indicated by the arrow then the nominal radius of curvature of the outer radius out would decrease and that of the inner radius in would increase symmetrically. In various embodiments if the user hovered the default cursor over the editing handle instead of the editing handle the mode symbol cursor would be displayed proximate to that editing handle and dragging that instance of the mode symbol cursor along the direction indicated by the arrow would also have the effect illustrated in and so on for the editing handles and .

In the embodiment shown in for each instance of an arc tool the related arc tool parameters comprise location parameters basic arc tool parameters and advanced arc tool parameters . The location parameters may include arc tool ROI position and size parameters and edge selector parameters . The basic arc tool parameters may include edge slope parameters edge type parameters and edge detection scan parameters . The advanced arc tool parameters may include filter type parameters and edge detection threshold parameters . The features of various exemplary embodiments of the parameters parameter control features and other user interface features corresponding to the elements and have been outlined throughout the previous disclosure and need not be repeated here.

In the embodiment shown in arc tool edit mode portion may comprise a normal mode portion a curvature changing mode portion a ROI rotation mode portion . The normal mode portion may include a parameter control feature type portion that may define and control the characteristics and operations associated with each distinct type of parameter control feature that is included in an arc tool GUI and or any associated menus or the like. For example in one embodiment the parameter control feature type portion may define and control the characteristics and operations associated with each of the four distinct types of editing handles described previously with reference to . The curvature changing mode portion and the ROI rotation mode portion may define and control the mode activation trigger characteristics and operations associated with their respective modes. The characteristics and editing operations associated with various exemplary types of parameter control features and exemplary curvature changing and ROI rotation modes have been outlined throughout the previous disclosure and need not be repeated here.

While exemplary user interface features and sequences of operations have been outlined when describing various exemplary embodiments of arc tools with reference to it will be appreciated that in other exemplary embodiments certain operations may be performed in other sequences and or one or more of the described operating features or GUI features may be omitted and the other inventive aspects of the methods and GUI s disclosed herein may still provide substantial benefits. Further while the distinct types of ROI parameter control features have been described as being distinguished by their locations relative to the region of interest of an arc tool alternatively they may be distinguished by distinct display symbols colors or the like. Thus while the preferred embodiment of the invention has been illustrated and described it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
