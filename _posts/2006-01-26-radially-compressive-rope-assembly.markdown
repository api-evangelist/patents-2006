The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon.

A radially compressive rope assembly which allows users thereof to descend along the rope assembly in a controlled manner by allowing the user to compress the mantle of the rope assembly thereby controlling descent. In particular a radially compressive rope assembly is provided having a load bearing rope core a mantle comprised of a flexible compressible material capable of recovery after deformation thereof and a sheath disposed around the outer perimeter of the mantle such that a user may compress squeeze the compressible mantle to slow descent down the rope in a controlled manner.

Conventionally when descending from elevated positions such as a helicopter via a rope in which users wish to rapidly engage safely descend and rapidly disengage from the rope so called fast ropes have been used. These conventional ropes are usually 1.5 to 2.0 inches in diameter and are constructed of a variety of synthetic fibers. Generally such fast ropes are of a braided construction providing a strong flexible rope.

In practice the user of a fast rope attaches the rope to a secure location and unfurls it spanning the altitude that the user wishes to descend. The user embraces the rope with his body and slides down the rope attempting to control the rate of his descent by squeezing the rope at his feet thighs and hands. This squeezing of the rope creates friction between the rope and the user thereby converting the kinetic energy created by the descent along the rope to heat energy and consequently controlling his descent despite gravity s influence to accelerate his body toward the ground.

However such conventional fast ropes present various problems related to control of descent. Firstly conventional fast ropes are incompressible by a human hand and thus require a user to possess relatively high hand strength i.e. require high squeezing force to create sufficient friction to control descent. This limitation of the amount of squeezing force the user can apply to the rope disallows some users from creating the friction needed to control the descent of their bodies.

Further today many fast rope users are descending fast ropes with more weight attached to their body than in previous years. For example soldiers now frequently carry an increased amount of gear for extended deployment in the field resulting in additional weight to control during descent. As mentioned above the inability to create sufficient friction results in loss of control during descent and is only exacerbated by the additional weight now frequently carried.

Consequently users of fast ropes now frequently land on the ground at unsafe velocities resulting in injuries such as fractured bones twisted ankles internal injuries and in severe cases even death. At the minimum users frequently experience burned hands from their attempts to apply maximum friction to the rope. In some circumstances when descending onto an elevated surface via a helicopter the helicopter and consequently the rope drift away from the elevated structure during descent causing the rope to hang in the air some altitude above the ground and or the elevated structure. Some users have been unable to halt their descent on the rope at this time and have instead slid off of the end of the rope at an unsafe elevation above the ground or elevated structure resulting in severe injuries.

Of those users who can provide the additional force necessary to maintain a safe descent speed the additional friction needed to control descent translates into more heat generation which raises the temperature of the user s body at the contact points. Many users experience burning of the hands even while wearing improved heat protective gloves. Of even more concern is a subset of users who reflexively release the rope during descent when experiencing the burning sensation caused by friction resulting in the user free falling the remaining altitude to the ground.

As discussed above conventional fast rope assemblies are effectively incompressible prohibiting the user from altering force through the movement or displacement of his hands. The primary method of controlling descent is to alter descent speed through varying the force applied to the rope while not displacing his hands from their original position . Human motor skills are optimized to control things in displacement regimes more effectively than force regimes e.g. squeezing . Force controls are more awkward for the user to manipulate than displacement controls. Conventional fast ropes allow only force control techniques to control descent speed and hence create difficulty for the user in controlling his descent.

In view of the deficiencies of the conventional fast ropes as described above it is an object of the present invention to provide a radially compressive rope assembly which allows a user to make a controlled descent without requiring excessive grip strength.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a radially compressive rope assembly whose structure results in the avoidance of high frictional heat generation during descent thereby avoiding the danger of burning as encountered with conventional fast ropes.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a radially compressive rope assembly which may be weighted at desired locations so as to alter the weight profile of the rope and provide stability where needed.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a radially compressive rope assembly that allows the user to control descent in the displacement regime.

As illustrated in the present invention provides a compressive rope comprised of a load bearing rope core a mantle as shown in disposed adjacent the load bearing rope core and a sheath disposed adjacent the mantle . The load bearing rope core as described in the twenty third and twenty sixth embodiments herein may have loops formed in both end portions and a swage fitting or eye splice disposed adjacent to each of the terminuses of the end portions of the rope core .

Generally the rope core of the present invention has been formed of a metallic material such as stainless steel wire rope. However the rope core may be formed of modern synthetic fibers such as Spectra Vectran etc. These modern synthetic fibers provide lightness in weight coupled with a high strength to weight ratio.

The mantle is disposed adjacent to the outer circumference of the rope core so as to provide frictional engagement therewith and is formed of flexible compressible material capable of recovery after deformation thereof. This flexible compressible material is a material that preferably maintains its compressibility characteristics within a temperature range of 20 F to 150 F and has a short memory time i.e. bounces back to original shape quickly after compression. For example closed cell foam such as closed cell vinyl nitrile foam ethylene propylene diene monomer or silicone sponge rubber may be used.

The mantle structurally is comprised of a first end portion a second end portion and a length portion therebetween. The length portion of the mantle has an inner circumference with a diameter defining an interior volume and an outer perimeter.

The sheath has a perimeter equal to or greater than the outer perimeter of the mantle . Further the sheath designed to protect the mantle and provide a durable user contact surface preferably has a length equal to or greater than the length of the mantle. The sheath is generally formed of a flexible polymeric coated fabric that serves to protect the mantle from abrasion and environmental damage while providing the necessary coefficient of friction for effective friction generation by the user s contact points with the compressive rope .

For example the sheath may be formed of a fabric coated with a polymeric material such as polyvinyl chloride coated fabric or polyurethane coated fabric. Alternatively the sheath may be comprised partially or wholly of a natural or synthetic leather or braided rope.

The sheath is adhered to the outer perimeter of the mantle using an adhesive composition. This adhesive composition is preferably a rubber based adhesive a polyurethane based adhesive or an acrylic based adhesive. Importantly the adhesive should be one that remains flexible after curing so as to allow the compressive rope to bend freely and one that does not soak into the mantle material while also preventing the sheath from moving relative to the mantle .

The mantle may be formed in any cross sectional shape. However it has been found that to provide the user with optimum grip the outer dimensions of the mantle and the sheath should have a cross section containing corners i.e. a polygon. For example it has been found that when a mantle has a square cross section as illustrated in when a user grips the rope the user will crush the corners first then begin to compress the entire body of the mantle. The rope s cross section will conform to the shape of the user s grip at various points of contact ensuring that the maximum surface area is available for friction generation.

In particular corners of a non circular cross section compressive rope protrude into the grasp of the user causing an uneven distribution of gripping force around the rope. This causes an easier deformation of the mantle than that achievable with a conventional circular cross section which has a more balanced distribution of gripping force . This ease in deformation provides for a surer grip and easier compression translating into a more controlled descent and safer roping operations.

Further the compressible mantle of the radially compressive rope assembly enables a user to alter his descent speed by moving his hand radially in relation to the rope. This allows a user to use the human preferred method of displacement control rather than force control as is used with conventional fast ropes to modulate the rate of descent. Displacement control allows for more accurate and precise changes in descent speed.

As the user descends down the rope he may alter his force of grip on the rope as well as move his hand and change the displacement of the mantle. Specifically to increase speed of descent the user relaxes his grip on the mantle so as to allow the volume of the mantle adjacent his hands to grow close to its original pre compressive size. To decrease speed the user tightens his grip on the rope thus compressing the mantle .

The compression of the mantle absorbs energy as any spring absorbs energy. This energy is now removed from the kinetic energy balance of the user and transferred into the rope. Importantly the energy does not like conventional fast ropes manifest itself in the form of heat energy at the rope user body interface thereby avoiding the burn hazard encountered with conventional fast ropes.

As the user slides down the rope the user s contact points along the rope and the rope s sheath also generate dynamic friction. The polymeric coating of the sheath of the present invention allows for more friction than conventional rope fibers but allows free but secure sliding along the rope when the user s grip is relaxed. This increase in friction allows for more of a reserve in braking ability permitting the user to slow or stop quicker if the situation requires.

In addition the polymeric coating of the sheath unlike conventional fast ropes is also able to maintain friction in wet environments. Although the present invention uses dynamic surface friction to aid in descent speed control since a portion of the user s kinetic energy is mitigated by internal mantle friction there is less reliance on surface friction to aid in controlling descent speed.

In an alternative embodiment of the present invention as described the eighth embodiment and as illustrated in the mantle may be comprised of a plurality of spokes having walls and tips said spokes extending parallel to the axis of the rope core . A plurality of voids are defined by the walls of said spokes . The spokes are comprised of a rubber based material so as to allow deformation or buckling of the spokes when force or pressure is exerted thereupon by a user. In such an embodiment the sheath is adhered to the outer surface of the mantle .

In a further alternative embodiment as provided in the twenty fourth embodiment as illustrated in herein the load bearing rope core has a hollow axial core therein the hollow axial core having one or more weighted portions disposed therein. These weighted portions may be strategically placed within the rope to alter the weight profile thereof.

In another embodiment of the present invention as illustrated in and as described in the twenty fifth embodiment herein one or more weighted portions may be attached to the load bearing rope so as to alter the ropes weight profile. For example as shown in steel stoppers may be swaged onto the load bearing rope core . These weights can aid in mitigating the radially compressible rope assembly s motion in high wind environments.

Alternatively as illustrated in the rope core itself my be comprised of segments that vary in diameter aiding in weighting the rope down in areas that are affected by high winds. As illustrated in this may take the form of attaching a smaller diameter rope to a larger diameter rope via a swage fitting.

As illustrated in herein the bottom loop of the radially compressive rope assembly of the present invention may be used to attach an anchor or exfiltration device to the radially compressive rope assembly . The exfiltration device is a strap that connects via a carabiner to the bottom loop of the radially compressive rope assembly . Along the length of the exfiltration device are loops which users may connect themselves to allowing a helicopter to lift the rope and attached user from the area.

In manufacturing the radially compressive rope assembly of the present invention the flexible compressive material used to construct the mantle is cut in the desired cross sectional shape and desired length. Then as illustrated in a slit is cut down the vertical axis thereof to allow fitting of the mantle around the load bearing rope core . Then adhesive is applied to the mantle in the vicinity of the slit so as to seal the mantle around the circumference of the load hearing rope core . Then the sheath is wrapped around and adhered to the mantle material .
