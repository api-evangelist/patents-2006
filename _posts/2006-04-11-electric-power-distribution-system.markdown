An example of an electric power distribution system mounted in an automobile is one that houses an electrical connecting box in a housing shaped cover. The electrical connection box has a structure in which a circuit assembly is accommodated in a case and the circuit assembly is structured to include a circuit board bus bars that are wired along the reverse face of the circuit board and switching members such as relays and the like that are mounted on the obverse side of the circuit board. The case is structured to include a frame shaped member that is disposed and secured along the outside perimeter of the circuit board a cover that is mounted so as to cover the circuit board from the obverse side in relation to the frame and a heat sink that is affixed to the reverse face of the circuit board and that covers the opening on the reverse side of the frame.

Note than an example of such an electrical connection box is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. JP A 2003 164039.

In this type of electric power distribution system parts accommodation portions that are formed on the top face of the frame shaped member are formed so as to be exposed from the opening portion of the top face of the cover and thereby attachment and detachment of parts for example fuses in the parts accommodation portions is simplified.

However in a structure in which the parts accommodation portions are exposed in the opening portion of the cover there is a concern that water remaining on the top face of the cover due to condensation and the like may penetrate inside the cover through gaps between the opening portion and the parts accommodation portions and may thereby adhere to the outside face the top face of the frame shaped member of the electrical connection box. In this case there is a concern that water will penetrate inside the electrical connection box through the gaps between the parts that form the case and as a result short circuits and the like will occur in the circuit assembly.

The present invention has been completed in view of the circumstances described above. It is an object of the present invention to increase the water drainage efficiency on the top face of the electrical connection box.

The electric power distribution system of the present invention is provided with an electrical connection box that is furnished with parts accommodation portions on the top face that enable the attachment and detachment of parts and a cover that can be mounted on the electrical connection box so as to cover at least the portion that excludes the parts accommodation portions on the top face thereof and drainage grooves that are provided on the top face of the electrical connection box extend to the outside face of the electrical connection box.

In this structure while the cover mounted on the electrical connection box covers the top face of the electrical connection box because the parts accommodation portions are exposed on the outside face of the cover there is a concern that water adhering to the top face of the cover may flow inside the top face of the electrical connection box through gaps between the opening portion of the cover and the parts accommodation portions.

However in the present invention because drainage grooves are formed on the top face of the electrical connection box that extend to the outside face thereof the water remaining on the top face of the electrical connection box flows into the drainage grooves and thereby is drained to the outside face side of the electrical connection box.

According to the present invention water that has flowed into the top face of the electrical connection box by penetrating through the gap between the cover and the parts accommodation portions can be reliably drained and thus there is no concern that the water will remain on the top face of the electrical connection box.

Below a first illustrative example which embodies the present invention will be explained with reference to through . In the electric power distribution system of this illustrative example the electrical connection box P is positioned on the housing H mounted in an automobile positioned between a battery not illustrated and electrical equipment such as lamps audio and the like not illustrated . The electrical connection box P not only takes electric power supplied by the battery and distributes and supplies it to the electrical equipment but also controls the switching and the like of the electric power that is supplied from the battery to each piece of equipment. In and the electrical connection box is drawn so that its obverse side faces upward but in its mounted state in an automobile as shown in and the electrical connection box is oriented such that a main body portion of a fuse block is positioned on the top side and arm portions of the fuse block extend downward. Hereinafter the up down and left right orientations are explained using the installed state in an automobile which is placed on a horizontal plane as the reference.

The electrical connection box includes a circuit assembly and a case on which the circuit assembly is positioned.

The circuit assembly includes a circuit board having a face that faces in a vertical direction a plurality of bus bars that are wired along the reverse face the right face in of the circuit board and switching members such as relays and the like that are mounted on the obverse side the left face in of the circuit board . The bus bars are bonded to the reverse face of the circuit board . First terminal portions that are formed on the ends of the bus bars project from the top end edge of the circuit board . In the same manner second terminal portions that are formed on the ends of the bus bars project from the bottom end edge of the circuit board .

The case includes a frame a heat sink a fuse block a cover plate a first housing and second through fourth housings and . The frame is made of an insulating material such as a synthetic resin or the like and is formed into a roughly rectangular frame shape. The heat sink is made of metal and is fixed to the frame such that it covers the opening on the reverse side of the frame . The fuse block is made of a synthetic resin and is attached to the frame on the top side thereof. The cover plate is made of a synthetic resin and is attached to the frame such that it covers the opening on the obverse side of the frame the opposite side from the heat sink . The first housing is made of a synthetic resin and is attached to the fuse block . The second through fourth housings and are made of a synthetic resin and are attached to the bottom edge portion of the frame .

The frame is arranged so that it surrounds the entire perimeter of the circuit assembly continuously along the outside perimeter of the circuit board and is also fixed to the obverse face of the heat sink by means of an adhesive not illustrated . The plurality of first terminal portions described above is arranged such that they are lined up side by side along the top edge portion of the frame . Rib shaped rocking restricting portions are formed on the outsides of both the left and right edge portions of the frame and extend in continuous straight lines in the up down direction the direction parallel to the direction in which the fuse block is attached to the frame and parallel to the length direction of the side edge portions . The rocking restricting portions are formed such that they extend from the top ends of the side edge portions to the vicinity of the bottom end portions. In addition a fitting plate that projects downward along the entire width area of the frame is formed at the bottom edge portion of the frame . The heat sink is roughly similar in shape to the circuit board and the reverse faces of the bus bars are bonded by an adhesive not illustrated to the obverse face of the heat sink .

The fuse block includes the horizontally long and roughly block shaped main body portion which is arranged along the top edge portion of the frame and a pair of arm portions which are shaped like cantilevers and extend downward downward in a perpendicular direction from both the left and right ends of the main body portion .

The top ends of the first terminal portions roughly the top halves of the terminal fittings and fuses that connect the first terminal portions and the terminal fittings are accommodated within the main body portion . Two parts accommodation portions left and right to accommodate fuses are formed on the horizontal top side of the main body portion . The parts accommodation portions are formed such that they project farther upward in a rectangular block shape than the top face of the main body portion and provide a space for accommodating the fuses at the top face side. Also on the top face of the main body portion two first drainage grooves are formed in the shape of rectangular frames that follow the outside perimeter face of each parts accommodation portion and surround the entire perimeter of each parts accommodation portion . The two first drainage grooves are disposed so as to be separated in the left right directions the length direction of the main body portion . The top end of the inside face inside peripheral face of the first drainage grooves and the bottom end of the outside peripheral face of the parts accommodation portions are vertically continuous so as to be flush along the entire perimeter at a height identical to the top face of the main body portion .

Two second drainage grooves are also similarly formed on the top face of the main body portion extending from the ends of front grooves F of the first drainage grooves so as to extend the front grooves F in straight lines toward the arm portions side the outside face of the electrical connection box P . The extended end portions of the second drainage grooves reach the outside face of the arm portions . The width of the second drainage grooves is wider than the width of the front grooves F. Also the front inside face of the front grooves F and the front inside face of the second drainage grooves are continuously flush. A pair of drainage channels formed by first drainage grooves and the second drainage grooves are disposed at an interval in the length direction the left right direction of the top face of the main body portion and extend in mutually opposing directions to reach the arm portions the outside face of the electrical connection box P .

In addition as shown in an inclined face that inclines with respect to the horizontal plane is formed on the bottom faces of the first drainage grooves and the second drainage grooves . The inclined face inclines overall such that liquids will flow through the first drainage grooves and the second drainage grooves towards drainage channels explained below. Specifically on the front groove F and the rear groove R of the first drainage grooves inclined faces F and R are formed over the entire length thereof so as to establish a downward slope that is inclined with respect to the horizontal plane from the center of the main body portion in the width direction towards the outside direction the arm portions . In addition in both the left and right side portions S of the first drainage grooves inclined faces S are formed over the entire length thereof so as to establish a downward slope that is inclined with respect to the horizontal plane from the rear drainage grooves R towards front groove F side. Furthermore on the second drainage grooves inclined faces A are formed over the entire length thereof so as to establish a downward slope that is inclined with respect to the horizontal plane from the first drainage grooves toward the drainage channels the arm portions . Water that is retained in the first drainage grooves and the second drainage grooves flows in the direction of the arrow in along the slope of the inclined faces A F R and S to arrive at the drainage channels . Note that the inclination angle of each of the inclined faces A F R and S is a constant angle from the topmost end of the inclined faces to the bottommost end but the inclination angles of the inclined faces A F R and S may differ in portions from the topmost end to the bottommost end of the inclined faces. In addition between the inclined faces A F R and S the inclination angles may be the same angle or the inclination angles may be different from each other.

The drainage channels that extend in the up down direction the direction parallel to the direction of extension of the arm portions are formed on the outside face of each arm portion . The drainage channels extend from the top end to the bottom end of the arm portion . The greater part of the drainage channels with the exception of its top end forms through holes in the up down direction that is enclosed on the front back left and right. The top ends of the drainage channels are continuous with the ends of the second drainage grooves . The bottom ends of the drainage channels are open to form drainage outlets . In addition groove shaped rocking restricting portions refer to that extend in straight lines in the up down direction are formed on the inside faces of the arm portions the faces that face the side edge portions of the frame .

Similarly tilting restricting portions that form a pair of grooves on the left and right are formed on the outside face of the arm portions . These tilting restricting portions are formed from the top end to the bottom end of the arm portions and are formed to extend in straight lines in the up down direction the direction identical to the insertion direction of the electrical connection box P in relation to the housing H . In addition a pair of pressing ribs that extends from the opening edge thereof inward is formed in roughly the bottom halves of the tilting restricting portions . Furthermore on the bottom end portion of the tilting restricting portions elastic engaging pieces are formed so as to extend downward in a cantilever shape. Engagement projections are formed on the outside face of the elastic engaging pieces

The fuse block is attached to the frame by moving it toward the frame from above. In the attachment process both arm portions slide on the outside faces of both the left and right side edge portions of the frame . The arm portions sandwich the frame from the left and right. This process positions the fuse block in the left right direction on the frame . The process also causes the rocking restricting portions and of the frame and the fuse block to engage with one another. This restricts the diagonal displacement tilting of the arm portions in relation to the side edge portions of the frame in the front back direction which is orthogonal to the length direction. It also positions the fuse block in relation to the frame in the front back direction. In addition the engagement of the rocking restricting portions and also guides the fuse block to its prescribed attachment position in relation to the frame . When the fuse block reaches the proper attachment position the fuse block and the frame are held in an attached state if the bottom end portions of the arm portions are affixed to the frame by screws.

In the attached state the drain outlets of the bottom ends of the drainage channels open downward in the bottom end portion of the frame case .

The first housing is attached to the main body portion of the fuse block from below. Roughly the bottom halves of the terminal fittings are positioned within the first housing . The fitting tube portions of the first housing are open facing downward. The second through fourth housings and are secured by screws to the obverse face front face of the bottom edge portion of the frame and have fitting tube portions that are open facing downward. Wiring harness connectors C are fitted into the fitting tube portions of the first through fourth housings and . The cover plate has an overall shape that is almost the same as that of the circuit board but it is larger than the circuit board in both length and width. The cover plate is attached to the frame from the front side. In its attached state the cover plate covers and conceals the circuit board and the switching member that are positioned within the frame .

The housing H includes a cover A and an upper lid B with an opened bottom face installed so as to cover the top face of the cover A. The cover A includes a supporting member with an opened bottom face and a bottom lid that is attached so as to cover the opening in the bottom face of this support member .

A horizontal plate portion that is aligned with the electrical connection box P is formed on the support member . A pair of left and right opening portions H are formed on the plate portion in order to expose the parts accommodation portions and an angled tube shaped guiding portion that extends downward inside the first drainage grooves are formed from the opening edge of each opening portion H along the entire perimeter and an angled tube shaped water barrier wall is formed that extends flush with the guiding portion downward the opposite side from the guiding portion from the opening edge of each opening portion H along the entire perimeter. The water barrier wall and guiding portion serve as a roughly square tube shaped tubular fitting portion a positioning portion of the present invention that passes in an up down direction through the plate portion

In addition a pair of left and right tilting restricting portions that extend in the up down direction are formed on the inside face of the supporting member . The tilting restricting portions include a supporting block portion that projects in a long and narrow block shape from the inside face of the supporting member and a pair of restricting ribs that project in the front back direction from both the front and back edge portions of this supporting block portion and a leak off groove is formed in the up down direction on the inside face of the support block portion . The formation area of the leak off groove extends from the top end of the supporting block portion to a position slightly above the bottom end and an engaging portion is formed on the bottom end portion of the leak off groove . Such a tilting restricting portion is formed so as to extend from a position in proximity to the bottom end face opening of the support member to the top end portion of the plate portion . A fitting groove which opens upward and is elongated in the left right direction is formed on the outer perimeter edge portion of the bottom lid .

When the electrical connection box P is accommodated inside the housing H first the bottom lid is removed from the supporting member the electrical connection box P is inserted from the opening in the bottom face of the supporting member and the top end portion of the tilting restricting portion of the fuse block is fit onto the bottom end portion of the tilting restricting portion . By fitting the tilting restricting portions and together the tilting relative displacement of the electrical connection box P in the front back direction in relation to the supporting member is restricted. When the insertion of the electrical connection box P progresses from this state due to the engagement between the tilting restricting portions and the electrical connection box P is guided so as to move to prescribed position and along a prescribed insertion path in relation to the supporting member . In addition during the approximately last half of the insertion operation the pressing ribs engage on the restricting ribs and thereby the tilting relative displacement of the arm portions the electrical connection box P in the left right direction in relation to the supporting member is restricted.

Then when the electrical connection box P reaches the normal attachment position the parts accommodation portions on the top end face of the fuse block is fit into the tubular fitting portion of the supporting member and thereby the relative displacement of the electrical connection box P in the front back left and right directions in relation to the supporting member the direction orthogonal to the insertion direction of the electrical connection box P in relation to the supporting member is restricted. In addition simultaneously because the engaging projections of the elastic engaging pieces are engaged from above to the engaging portions the electrical connection box P is restricted from falling downward coming out of the supporting member in relation to the supporting member and except for the bottom end portion of the electrical connection box P the electrical connection box P is positioned inside the supporting member .

Subsequently when the bottom lid is attached to the opening at the bottom face of the supporting member the cover A is formed and except for the top face of the parts accommodation portion that is exposed above from the tubular fitting portion that is the openings for attaching and detaching the fuses almost the entire electrical connection box P is positioned inside the cover A. In addition accompanying the attachment of the bottom lid the fitting plate on the bottom face of the electrical connection box P and the fitting groove of the bottom lid are fit together. Finally when the upper lid B is attached so as to cover the top face the opening on the top faces of the parts accommodation portions of the cover A the housing H is complete the accommodation step of the electrical connection box P in the housing H is finished and the electric power distribution system is complete.

In the state in which the electrical connection box P is positioned in the cover A the top faces of the parts accommodation portions are positioned a little above the plate portion but the outside peripheral face of these parts accommodation portions is surrounded by the water barrier wall . In addition the top end of the water barrier wall is positioned at a height that is substantially identical to that of the top end of the parts accommodation portion . In addition the water barrier wall and the guiding portion are enclosed so as to face each other and only a small interval is established in relation to the outside peripheral face of the parts accommodation portions . Furthermore the guiding portion projects towards the inside of the first drainage groove .

In this illustrative example while the electrical connection box P is accommodated in the cover A the parts accommodation portions are exposed to the outside at the opening portion H the tubular fitting portion on the top face of the cover A and thus there is a concern that water that adheres to the top face of this cover A will penetrate the top face of the case of the electrical connection box P the main body portion of the fuse block through the gap between the opening portion H of the cover A and the parts accommodation portion .

However in this illustrative example the drainage grooves and are formed on the top face of the case so as to extend to the drainage channels on the outside face of the case and the inclined faces that establish a downward slope towards the drainage channels are formed on the bottom face of the drainage grooves and . Thus water that remains on the top face of the case main body portion can be reliably drained by flowing into the drainage grooves and then flowing along the inclined faces .

In particular in this illustrative example the drainage grooves and are provided as a pair of separate left and right drainage channels having a gap therebetween in the length direction of the top face of the electrical connection box P. Thus in comparison to a structure in which one drainage groove is formed substantially along the entire length of the top face of the electrical connection box the maximum length of the drainage grooves extending to the drainage channels becomes short. Therefore the water drainage capacity is superior.

In addition because the outside peripheral face of the parts accommodation portions and the inside peripheral face of the first drainage grooves that surround the parts accommodation portions are joined flush to each other the water adhering to the outside peripheral face of the parts accommodation portions is reliably guided into the first drainage grooves without attaching to the top face of the main body portion .

Furthermore in this illustrative example the parts accommodation portions are formed so as to project upward from the top face of the cover A but because the water barrier wall that rises from the opening edge of the opening portion H that exposes these parts accommodation portions is formed on the cover A water that remains on the top face of the cover A the plate portion of the supporting member can be prevented from adhering to the top face and the outside peripheral face of the parts accommodation portions .

Furthermore in this illustrative example a guiding portion is formed that extends downward from the opening edge of the opening portion H towards the inside of the first drainage grooves and thus even in the case in which water adheres to the inside peripheral face of the water barrier wall this water can be reliably guided into the first drainage grooves by flowing from the water barrier wall along the inside peripheral face of the guiding portion

In addition because the water that flows into the drainage grooves and is drained by a path from the top face of the case the fuse block through the drainage channels to the bottom end portion of the case even if the outside face of the case and the electrical contact portion are disposed on the front face shorting does not occur at this electrical contact portion. Furthermore because the drainage channels have the form of a through hole even when the electrical connection box is vibrated there is no concern that water will leak outside the drainage channels .

In addition the case is provided with a frame and a fuse block . This flame has a face that faces in a vertical direction and is disposed along the peripheral edge portion of the circuit board and the fuse block is formed such that the arm portions are extended downward from the main body portion that is disposed along the top edge portion of the frame so as to align with the side edge portion of the frame . However in the illustrative example the shape of this fuse block is used and the drainage grooves and are formed on the main body portion of the fuse block and drainage channels are formed on the arm portions . Furthermore by engaging the rocking restricting portions of the arm portions with the rocking restricting portions of the side edge portion of the frame the fuse block is restricted from tilting in the front back direction in relation to the frame because the main body portion acts as a fulcrum. In this manner in this illustrative example because the arm portions which are structures that form the drainage channels also serve as the tilting restricting means of the fuse block the shape of the fuse block is thereby made simpler than a structure in which the tilting restricting means of the fuse block are formed separately from the arm portions .

In this illustrative example positioning portions the parts accommodation portions and the tubular fitting portion that restrict movement of the electrical connection box P in the front back left and right directions in the holding member A are provided by engaging the top end edge portion of the electrical connection box P and the holding member A of the housing H together. However tilting restricting portions and are provided on the supporting member of the holding member A and the electrical connection box P. These tilting restricting portions and are disposed at a position separated downward from the positioning portions and enable restricting the electrical connection box P from tilting by being fit together where the fitting portion of the positioning portions the parts accommodation portions and the tubular fitting portions acts substantially as a fulcrum. In this manner because the electrical connection box P which has been inserted in the supporting member is engaged by the supporting member at the mutually separated positioning portions the parts accommodation portions and the tubular fitting portion and the tilting restricting portion and it is possible to prevent the electrical connection box P from tilting in the front back direction where the portion that fits the positioning portions the parts accommodation portion and the tubular fitting portion acts substantially as a fulcrum.

In addition because the tilting restricting portions and are formed to extend along the insertion direction of the electrical connection box P in relation to the supporting member the tilting restricting portions and are fit together when the electrical connection box P is inserted into the supporting member . Thereby the electrical connection box P is guided along a prescribed insertion path in relation to the supporting member and the positioning portions of the electrical connection box P and the supporting member the parts accommodation portions and the tubular fitting portion can be reliably engaged.

In addition because the tilting restricting portion of the supporting member is disposed in proximity to the opening of the supporting member during the process of inserting the electrical connection box P into the supporting member it is possible to confirm visually the fitting state of the tilting restricting portions and .

In addition in the case in which the positioning portions and the tilting restricting portions that differ from this illustrative example are formed by different members the positioning portions and the tilting restricting portions may be misaligned because of the attachment tolerances of both members and as a result there is a concern that when the electrical connection box P is inserted into the supporting member the positioning members will not be able to engage together smoothly. However in this illustrative example because the positioning portion the parts accommodation portion on the electrical connection box P side and the tilting restricting portion are formed in one part the fuse block there is no concern that the engagement between the positioning portions the parts accommodation portion and the tubular fitting portion will be hindered because of the attachment tolerances between members.

Next the second illustrative example which embodies the present invention will be explained with reference to . The electrical connection box P of the second illustrative example forms a communicating groove on the top face of the main body portion of the fuse block of the electrical connection box P in the first illustrative example. Because the other components are identical to those of the first illustrative example identical reference numerals are used to denote the identical components and the explanations of the structures the operations and the effects are omitted.

The communication groove is formed so as to enable the pair of left and right first drainage grooves to communicate with each other and the communication groove is formed so as to extend from the end portion of the rear groove R of each of the first drainage grooves such that the rear groove R is extended in a straight line towards the side opposite to the arm portions the center side in the width direction . The back inside face of the communication groove and the back inside face of the rear grooves R are connected so as to be flush. In addition the width of the communication groove has substantially the same dimension as the width of the rear grooves R and the width is narrower than the gap from the front inside face of the front grooves F to the back inside face of the rear grooves R. On the bottom face of this communication groove inclined faces are formed that are inclined with respect to the horizontal plane that is identical to that of the inclined faces which are formed on the bottom face of the first drainage grooves and the second drainage grooves . These inclined faces are slightly inclined so as to establish a downward slope towards the left right direction the arm portions side where the approximate center positions of both the left and right first drainage grooves serves as the ridge line in the width direction the length direction of the main body portion . That is the pair of left and right inclined faces forms a continuous hill shape at the end portion ridge line at one end thereof. The other ends of the pair of left and right inclined faces are connected smoothly and flush with each other in relation to the inclined faces R of the rear groove R. Note that the inclination angle of the inclined faces R of the rear groove R and the inclination angle of the inclined faces of the communication groove may be identical angles or may be different angles.

Because the electrical connection box P is mounted on an automobile there are cases in which the electrical connection box P tilts at an angle that is larger than the slope of the inclined faces of the drainage grooves and because of the tilting of the vehicle body caused by the slope of the road face while the automobile is stopped the rolling during driving pitching nose diving and the like. When such a case occurs there is a concern that water in the first drainage grooves among the two left and right first drainage grooves that is positioned on the higher side the top side of the inclination may remain at the end portion on the side opposite to the outside face arm portions of the main body portion in this first drainage groove . However in the second illustrative example because the pair of first drainage grooves communicates by the communication groove the water in the first drainage groove positioned on the upper side of the inclination flows into the first drainage groove positioned on the lower side of the inclination and thereby the water is reliably drained to the outside face of the main body portion .

In addition the inclined faces of the communication groove are inclined so as to establish a downward slope towards both sides where the center position the approximate center position in the width direction on the top face of the main body portion of both first drainage grooves serves as a ridge line . Because the pair of drainage grooves and are provided separated in both directions with the ridge line interposed therebetween the water that flows into the communication groove does not stagnate in the communication groove and reliably flows into the drainage grooves and to drain outside the main body portion .

Next a third illustrative example which embodies the present invention will be explained with reference to and . The electrical connection box P of the third illustrative example is provided with in the second illustrative example a pair of front and rear communication grooves F and R which are substantially parallel to each other with an interval therebetween in the front back direction orthogonal to the direction of separation the left right direction between the pair of drainage grooves . The width dimension of these communication grooves F and R is larger than that of the front grooves F and the rear grooves R and the front inside face of the front communication groove F is continuously flush with the front inside face of the front grooves F and the back inside face of the rear communication groove R is continuously flush with the back inside face of the rear grooves R. Specifically the front inside face of the front communication groove F the front inside face of front grooves F of the first drainage grooves and the front inside face of the second drainage grooves are connected in a straight line when viewed from above. Note that a groove portion that corresponds to the side grooves S of the communication groove side formed in the first and second illustrative examples are not formed on the first drainage grooves . Specifically the flat planar shape of the first drainage grooves roughly forms a U shape. In addition a pair of inclined faces that establishes a downward slope from the ridge line towards the first drainage grooves is formed on the bottom face of each of the communication grooves F and R. In this third illustrative example because two communication grooves F and R are provided the drainage efficiency is favorable. Note that because other components are the same as those in the second illustrative example described above identical structures are denoted by identical reference numerals and the explanations of the structures the operations and the effects thereof are omitted.
