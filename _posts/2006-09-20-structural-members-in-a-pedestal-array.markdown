title: Structural members in a pedestal array
abstract: A turbine engine component has a flow path wall and a support wall. The turbine engine component has at least one cooling compact heat exchanger. Each cooling compact heat exchanger has a pedestal array and at least one structural member within the pedestal array for preventing modal crossing in operation range, for preventing panel bulging, and/or for connecting the flow path wall to at least one outer diameter support structure.

The Government of the United States of America may have rights in the present invention as a result of Contract No. N00019 02 C 3003 awarded by the Department of the Navy.

The present invention relates to structural members for use in cooling compact heat exchangers used in turbine engine components.

Compact heat exchanger arrays are used in a wide variety of turbine engine components to effect cooling of the components. Many such compact heat exchangers include arrays of pedestals. To make efficient use of compact heat exchanger pedestal arrays cavities are created with substantial distances between inlets and exits and between side walls of the array. The pedestals within these arrays may be susceptible to fracture at temperature and deflections under operation. With time this could lead to the hot wall bulging into the flow path due to pressure loads and temperatures. Additionally the unsupported panel might have vibrational natural frequencies that coincide with engine forcing functions during operation which could lead to high cycle fatigue.

In accordance with the present invention there are provided structural members for pedestals arrays which alleviate the foregoing problems.

The present invention is directed to a turbine engine component having a flow path wall and a support wall. The turbine engine component broadly comprises at least one cooling compact heat exchanger. Each compact heat exchanger has a pedestal array and at least one structural member within the pedestal array for preventing modal crossing in operation range for preventing panel bulging and or for connecting the flow path wall to outer diameter support structures. The term modal crossing refers to a coincidence of the natural frequencies of the turbine engine component with a forcing function of the engine at operational conditions. It drives oscillations of part features and may lead to premature cyclic failure.

Other details of the structural members in a pedestal array of the present invention as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.

Referring now to the drawings illustrates a turbine engine component such as a blade outer air seal. The turbine engine component has a leading edge and a trailing edge . The component also has an outer diameter and an inner diameter .

To effect cooling of the component a plurality of compact heat exchangers is embedded within the component. The compact heat exchangers may include a leading edge compact heat exchanger a main body compact heat exchanger and a trailing edge compact heat exchanger . Each of the compact heat exchangers and has a flow path wall and a support wall . The flow path wall is the hot wall while the support wall is the cold wall. Still further each of the compact heat exchangers has a plurality of inlets for a cooling fluid and a plurality of outlets .

As shown in within each of the circuits and there are a plurality of pedestals . The pedestals create turbulence within each heat exchanger and thereby improve the heat transfer characteristics of the heat exchanger. The pedestals may have any desired shape. For example each of the pedestals could be cylindrical in shape. Still further each of the pedestals may be multi sided such as having seven sides.

Embedded within each of the compact heat exchangers and are a plurality of structural members . Each of the structural members is designed to unite a plurality of pedestals into a larger viable cluster. For example each of the structural members may unite from 4 to 7 pedestals. Each structural member is dimensioned such that a minimum flow area is maintained between the structural member and the surrounding pedestals . Each structural member is preferably a cast structure made from the same material as that from which the turbine engine component is made.

The structural members may be positioned within the pedestal array in each of the compact heat exchangers and at discrete locations to prevent modal crossing in operation range and prevent panel bulging. Further each of the structural members has a height sufficient to connect the inner diameter hot wall with the outer diameter wall which is connected to one or more outer diameter support structures such as the OD plate located outboard of the core passages . The attachment features may be joined to the plate . For example dotted line area in outlines one such area of intersection between features and .

If desired a plurality of structural members may be positioned in an aligned configuration see in the same rows of pedestals . Each of the structural members comprises a merger of multiple pedestals and may have any desired shape. For example the structural members may have a polygonal shape with as many sides as necessary for joining a desired number of the pedestals .

The structural members when compared to a pedestal array provide a more robust connection between the flow path wall to the support structure of the component in order to prevent bulging creep of the flow path wall . The structural members also prevent modal crossings in the operating range particularly in the blade rubtrack where the blade passing is a potential forcing function.

While the turbine engine component has been described as being a blade outer air seal it could also be a blade or a vane. The structural members could be used in any cooling compact heat exchangers in any turbine engine component.

While the turbine engine component has been described as having a plurality of cooling compact heat exchangers the component can have fewer such as one cooling compact heat exchanger or more than three cooling compact heat exchangers.

It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention structural members in a pedestal array which fully satisfy the objects means and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof other unforeseeable alternatives modifications and variations may become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly it is intended to embrace those alternatives modifications and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims.
