Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in humans. Although a variety of drugs against neoplastic diseases have been developed and techniques are available such as surgery and radiation therapy there is still a need for alternative and improved methods of treatment of neoplastic diseases.

Autoimmune diseases are associated with abnormal lymphoproliferation as a result of defects in the termination of lymphocyte activation and growth. Often such diseases are associated with inflammation like rheumatoid arthritis insulin dependent diabetes mellitus multiple sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosus and the like. The treatment of such diseases is focused on anti inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs which in numerous cases show severe side effects. Hence there is a need for alternative drugs with a new mode of action showing less side effects.

Apoptosis is a term used to describe a series of cellular events which occur to bring about programmed cell death. There are various apoptotic pathways some of which have been characterized whereas others remain to be elucidated. If the balance between cell division and apoptosis is disturbed life threatening diseases including cancer autoimmune disorders neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases may occur.

In recent years it has become evident that programmed cell death apoptosis is as important to the health of a multicellular organism as cell division. By repeated cell division and differentiation throughout development or tissue repair surplus or even harmful cells are generated. In order to maintain tissue homeostasis these cells have to be removed or killed. The delicate interplay between cell growth and apoptosis in an organism is mirrored in the complex molecular balance that determines whether an individual cell undergoes division arrests in the cell cycle or commits to programmed cell death.

Dysregulation of cell proliferation or lack of appropriate cell death has wide ranging clinical implications. A number of diseases associated with such dysregulation involve hyperproliferation inflammation tissue remodeling and repair. Familiar indications in this category include cancers restenosis neointimal hyperplasia angiogenesis endometriosis lymphoproliferative disorders transplantation related pathologies graft rejection polyposis loss of neural function in the case of tissue remodeling and the like. Such cells may lose the normal regulatory control of cell division and may also fail to undergo appropriate cell death.

As apoptosis is inhibited or delayed in most types of proliferative neoplastic diseases induction of apoptosis is an option for treatment of cancer especially in cancer types which show resistance to classic chemotherapy radiation and immunotherapy Apoptosis and Cancer Chemotherapy Hickman and Dive eds. Blackwell Publishing 1999 . Also in autoimmune and transplantation related diseases and pathologies compounds inducing apoptosis may be used to restore normal cell death processes and therefore can eradicate the symptoms and might cure the diseases. Further applications of compounds inducing apoptosis may be in restenosis i.e. accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the walls of arteries and in persistent infections caused by a failure to eradicate bacteria and virus infected cells. Furthermore apoptosis can be induced or re established in epithelial cells in endothelial cells in muscle cells and in others which have lost contact with extracellular matrix. These cells are potentially able to colonize other organs and therefore can develop into pathologies like neoplasias endometriosis and the like.

B MTS proliferation assay measuring the metabolic activity of cells. Viable cells are metabolically active whereas cells with compromised respiratory chain show a reduced activity in this test. C AnnexinV binding assay which reflects the phosphatidylserine content of the outer lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. This event is considered an early hallmark of apoptosis. D PI staining for cell cycle distribution which shows any alterations in the distribution among the different phases of the cell cycle. Cell cycle arresting points can be determined. E Proliferation assay monitoring DNA synthesis by incorporating bromodeoxyuridine BrdU . Inhibitory effects on growth proliferation can be directly determined.

Furthermore the invention provides a method for the treatment of a neoplastic disease autoimmune disease transplantation related pathology and or degenerative disease which comprises administering a compound of formula I a compound of formula II a pro drug or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof wherein the radicals and symbols have the meanings as defined above in a quantity effective against said disease to a warm blooded animal requiring such treatment.

A compound of the invention may be prepared by processes that though not applied hitherto for the new compounds of the present invention are known per se in particular

A for the preparation of a compound of formula I wherein Ris amino NHRand Ris hydrogen a process wherein an o cyano phenoxyacetophenone or corresponding heterocyclic compound of formula II

H for the preparation of a compound of formula II a process wherein an o substituted phenol or thiophenol of formula VII 

and if so desired an obtainable compound of formula I or of formula II is converted into another compound of formula I or of formula II a free compound of formula I or of formula II is converted into a salt an obtainable salt of a compound of formula I or of formula II is converted into the free compound or another salt and or a mixture of isomeric compounds of formula I or of formula II is separated into the individual isomers.

A suitable base for the cyclization reaction in methods A D and G is e.g. an aqueous buffer solution of pH 7 and above a metal carbonate or bicarbonate such as potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate a metal hydroxide such as lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide a metal alcoholate such as sodium methoxide or potassium tert butoxide a tertiary amine such as diisopropylethylamine or pyridine a metal amide such as lithium diisopropylamide or a phosphazene base such as tert butylimino tris dimethylamino phosphorane.

Method B is a transformation usually referred to as Williamson ether synthesis and is achieved under reaction conditions typical for this reaction. Leaving groups Z considered are e.g. halogen such as chloro or bromo and sulfonates e.g. p toluenesulfonate.

Strong bases considered in method Ca are e.g. metal amides or phosphazene bases or also alcoholates which convert the alcohol of formula VIa to the corresponding anion but is less reactive than the anion derived from alcohol VIa . Preferably the alcohol of formula VIa is first converted into the corresponding alcoholate e.g. with sodium hydride butyllithium or lithium diisopropylamide.

For the introduction of an amino function in method Cb with an amine of formula VIb the reaction is usually performed without base but can also be reacted in the presence of a suitable tertiary amine e.g. dimethylaminopyridine diisopropyl ethylamine or 1 4 diaza 2.2.2 bicyclooctane. It may be emphasized that in case of Rand Z both representing fluorine Z can be replaced regioselectively.

The introduction of an amino function in method Cc is referred to as Buchwald Hartwig amination. The reaction is preferably carried out in an unpolar aprotic solvent in the presence of a soluble palladium catalyst comprising an appropriate ligand. A particularly useful catalyst is palladium bis dibenzylideneacetone Pd dba . The reactivity of the palladium catalyst can be tuned by the choice of the ligand.

For the introduction of a group Rother than alkoxy or amino in method Cd transition metal catalyzed carbon carbon bond forming reactions may be used. Such reactions are known to the expert as Suzuki Negishi Kumada and Stille coupling reactions and are performed under typical reaction conditions using the appropriate catalyst.

In method E preferred leaving groups Z are e.g. halogen such as chloro or bromo and also sulfonates e.g. p toluenesulfonate. Strong bases considered are metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide metal alkoxide e.g. potassium t butoxide or metal amides e.g. lithium diisopropylamide.

In method F cyclization is performed with a halogenating agent e.g. elemental halogen such as bromine complexes of halogen with amines such as pyridinium tribromide and copper halogenides such as copper II bromide or copper II chloride in the presence of a base compatible with oxidation reagents e.g. metal carbonates such as potassium carbonate or metal hydroxide such as lithium hydroxide. In place of the halogenating it is also possible to use a sulfonyloxy introducing agent e.g. a iodonium compound such as hydroxy tosyloxy iodo benzene.

Suitable leaving groups Z in method H are e.g. halogen such as chloro or bromo sulfonates e.g. p toluenesulfonate or another activated hydroxy group.

If one or more other functional groups for example carboxy hydroxy or amino are or need to be protected in a compound of formulas II to X because they should not take part in the reaction these are such protecting groups as are usually applied in the synthesis of amides in particular peptide compounds cephalosporins penicillins nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.

The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions such as acylations etherifications esterifications oxidations solvolysis and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily i.e. without undesired secondary reactions to removal typically by solvolysis reduction photolysis or also by enzyme activity for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions and that they are not present in the end products. The specialist knows or can easily establish which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter.

The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups the protecting groups themselves and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference books for peptide synthesis and in special books on protective groups such as J. F. W. McOmie Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry Plenum Press London and New York 1973 in Methoden der organischen Chemie Methods of organic chemistry Houben Weyl 4th edition Volume 15 I Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1974 and in T. W. Greene Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis Wiley New York.

In the additional process steps carried out as desired functional groups of the starting compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected for example by one or more of the protecting groups mentioned hereinabove under protecting groups . The protecting groups are then wholly or partly removed according to one of the methods described there.

In the conversion of an obtainable compound of formula I or of formula II into another compound of formula I or of formula II an amino group may be alkylated or acylated to give the correspondingly substituted compounds. Alkylation may be performed with an alkyl halide or an activated alkyl ester. For methylation diazomethane may be used. Alkylation may also be performed with an aldehyde under reducing conditions. For acylation the corresponding acyl chloride is preferred. Alternatively an acid anhydride may be used or acylation may be accomplished with the free acid under conditions used for amide formation known per se in peptide chemistry e.g. with activating agents for the carboxy group such as 1 hydroxybenzotriazole optionally in the presence of suitable catalysts or co reagents. Furthermore amine may be transformed into heteroaryl and heterocyclyl under reaction conditions typical for such cyclizations.

A hydroxy group e.g. a hydroxy group R a hydroxy group in the ring A or a hydroxy group as the substituent R may be alkylated etherified or acylated esterified to give the correspondingly substituted compounds in a procedure related to the one described for an amino group. Alkylation may be performed with an alkyl halide or an activated alkyl ester. For methylation diazomethane may be used. For acylation the corresponding acyl chloride or acid anhydride may be used or acylation may be accomplished with the free acid and a suitable activating agent.

Reduction of a nitro group in a nitro substituted aryl or heteroaryl group to give the corresponding amino group is done e.g. with iron powder in alcohol or with other reducing agents.

A carboxy group in a carboxy substituted aryl or heteroaryl group may be amidated under conditions used for amide formation known per se in peptide chemistry e.g. with the corresponding amine and an activating agent for the carboxy group such as 1 hydroxybenzotriazole optionally in the presence of suitable catalysts or co reagents.

A chloro bromo or iodo substitutent in an aryl or heteroaryl group may be replaced by phenyl or a phenyl derivative by reaction with a suitable phenylboronic acid in a Suzuki reaction as described under method Cd .

In the conversion of a compound of formula II into another compound of formula II using the aforementioned reaction conditions care must be taken not to submit the compounds to basic conditions because otherwise the compound of formula II will cyclize to give a corresponding compound of formula I in a reaction corresponding to process A D or G .

Salts of a compound of formula I or of formula II with a salt forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I or of formula II may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent.

Salts can usually be converted to free compounds e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents for example with alkali metal carbonates alkali metal hydrogencarbonates or alkali metal hydroxides typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.

It should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates.

All process steps described here can be carried out under known reaction conditions preferably under those specifically mentioned in the absence of or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents preferably such as are inert to the reagents used and able to dissolve these in the absence or presence of catalysts condensing agents or neutralising agents for example ion exchangers typically cation exchangers for example in the H form depending on the type of reaction and or reactants at reduced normal or elevated temperature for example in the range from 100 C. to about 190 C. preferably from about 80 C. to about 150 C. for example at 80 to 60 C. at 20 to 40 C. at room temperature or at the boiling point of the solvent used under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel where appropriate under pressure and or in an inert atmosphere for example under argon or nitrogen.

Salts may be present in all starting compounds and transients if these contain salt forming groups. Salts may also be present during the reaction of such compounds provided the reaction is not thereby disturbed.

At all reaction stages isomeric mixtures that occur can be separated into their individual isomers e.g. diastereomers or enantiomers or into any mixtures of isomers e.g. racemates or diastereomeric mixtures.

The invention relates also to those forms of the process in which one starts from a compound obtainable at any stage as a transient and carries out the missing steps or breaks off the process at any stage or forms a starting material under the reaction conditions or uses said starting material in the form of a reactive derivative or salt or produces a compound obtainable by means of the process according to the invention and further processes the said compound in situ. In the preferred embodiment one starts from those starting materials which lead to the compounds described hereinabove as preferred particularly as especially preferred primarily preferred and or preferred above all.

Starting materials of formula III to X are known commercially available or can be synthesized in analogy to or according to methods that are known in the art.

For example a compound of formula III is obtained in a cyclization reaction related to process A but with a starting compound wherein the substituent Rin formula II is OH preferably in protected form e.g. as a methyl or optionally substituted benzyl ether or as an ester with an organic acid. A compound of formula V is also obtained in a cyclization reaction related to process A but with a starting compound wherein the substituent Rin formula II is a leaving group Z or a suitable precursor thereof.

A defined number of EGFP transfected adherent test cells 96 well plates 10 10 384 well plates 1500 2 10 are plated out 24 h before treatment either in 75 l 96 well plates or 60 l 384 well plates complete medium per well in order to ensure appropriate cell spreading. For this purpose a peristaltic pump e.g. Multidrop by Thermo Labsystems Finland or another suitable device is used. Cells in suspension are plated out according to the same procedure but 1 h prior to treatment. Between seeding out and treatment or addition of compounds the cells are incubated at 37 C. under 7.5 CO. Subsequently the compounds under investigation are added at defined concentrations 40 80 M in either 25 l 96 well plates or 20 l 384 well plates complete medium containing max 4 DMSO with an appropriate device e.g. liquid handling system multi channel pipette etc. resulting in a final concentration in the test well of 10 20 M compound in max 1 DMSO.

The gain is adjusted in such a way that the control cells produce a fluorescence activity of 90 of the maximum. Kinetics is performed by measuring the relative fluorescence activities at t 0 h 8 h 24 h and 48 h. Crude fluorescence activities are individually normalized for different cell numbers and various optical activities of the test compounds plate wells by dividing each value from t 8 h 24 h and 48 h by the value of t 0 h resulting in E 8 E 24 and E 48 values.

1 2 10cells are seeded into 24 well tissue culture plates and incubated for 24 h prior to compound addition. Compounds are added for 24 h in a final concentration of 3 M or 10 M. Adherent cells are harvested by trypsinization. The cell suspensions are fixed by adding 2 parts ice cold ethanol 100 while vortexing. Then the samples are stored for 2 h at 20 C. Subsequently the cells are washed with PBS once and resuspended in 250 l PBS containing 50 g ml PI Calbiochem 537059 then the samples are incubated at 37 C. for 30 minutes and subsequently analyzed on a FACSCalibur monitoring linear PI fluorescence activity on FL2. The readout allows the detection of a possible direct or indirect influence of the tested compounds on the cell cycle. All active compounds of formula I and formula II arrest cell population in G2M phase. In this assay compounds have shown activity at concentrations as low as 20 nM.

This assay is performed in 96 well tissue culture plates. Appropriate number of cells adherent cells 3 5 10 suspension cells 8 10 10 are being seeded out in 80 l complete medium. Adherent cells are incubated for 24 h for proper spreading out before addition of test compounds while suspension cells are immediately treated with test compounds after seeding out. The test compounds are added in 20 l complete medium containing max 5 DMSO. The final compound concentrations in the assays are in the range of 0.001 M 10 M dependent on the potency of the compounds under investigation. After 24 h or 48 h incubation at culture conditions 10 l medium containing JC 1 Molecular Probes T 3168 at 2 5 g ml are added to each well. The assay plates are then further incubated for 30 minutes and subsequently analyzed with a standard inverted fluorescence microscope by using the FITC and TRITC filters. Cells with an intact mitochondrial membrane potential mmp show an orange staining visualized with the TRITC filter while cells with a perturbed or missing mmp demonstrate a green staining visualized with the FITC filter .

The readout allows the determination of the fraction of cells which show a dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential strongly indicating an apoptotic cell death as a function of the treatment. Results are indicated in Table 13. The scores A B C and D are explained at the end of the Table.

Appropriate numbers of cells 100 150 cells dependent on the cell type are being seeded out in 1 ml complete medium into 6 well plates and allowed to attach for 48 h. The compounds are added after 48 h in 500 l solution. The concentrations are in the range of 0.001 M 3 M. Control plates receive the same volume of medium containing the appropriate amount of DMSO. The plates are incubated for 5 7 days at cell culture conditions and subsequently scored for growth of colonies containing more than 30 cells by using a microscope. Scores based on IC50 values are indicated in Table 14.
