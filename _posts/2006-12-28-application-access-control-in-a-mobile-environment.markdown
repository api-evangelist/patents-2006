title: Application access control in a mobile environment
abstract: A system and method are described whereby a mobile device controls access to mobile applications based on access conditions associated with a current access network. To prevent mobile applications from running when the access conditions are not suitable, the mobile device includes a policy database used to store a list of access conditions that are inappropriate for launching the installed applications. The access conditions are based on the type of the current access network used by the mobile device for launching or maintaining the requested application session. The access conditions indicate whether the mobile device is currently accessing its home network or roaming on another provider's network. Similarly, the access conditions indicate the type of network access interface used by the current network to provide the data connection necessary to run the requested application. The policy database correlates predetermined actions with the access conditions associated with a given application session.

This invention relates generally to the field of telecommunications and more specifically to the field of mobile telecommunications.

With the transition to third generation wireless networks a multitude of mobile applications extending the availability of Internet services to a mobile environment have become available. Wireless multimedia applications in particular are designed to bring the spectrum of entertainment and communications options previously available only via home or corporate networks to the wireless marketplace. Such applications and services are typically data intensive and therefore are best suited to run on wireless networks capable of meeting the increased data requirements. Video streaming applications for example allow the wireless consumers to stream content from a remote server or a home computer to a mobile device and require wireless access networks with high data handling capabilities in order to meet the minimum Quality of Service QoS requirements and provide a satisfying user experience. While such high speed data network standards as EVDO are designed to meet the needs of high bandwidth mobile multimedia applications access networks operating in accordance with specifications having lower data handling capabilities may not be suitable for initiating data intensive application sessions especially in light of inherent mobility of wireless consumers. Given the abundance of multi mode devices capable of accessing wireless networks that operate on different network standards there are times when the requested application or service and the current access network are incompatible. Correspondingly application requests launched on inappropriate access networks result in monopolization of available system resources by incompatible application sessions.

Another access network incompatibility scenario occurs when the mobile consumer is roaming outside of its home coverage area at the time when an over the air firmware update is taking place by invoking a firmware update application of the mobile device. In this case the resulting firmware download results in unwanted roaming charges to the consumer.

Embodiments of the invention are used to provide a system and method for controlling access to mobile applications from the mobile device based on access conditions associated with a current access network To prevent one or more applications or services from running when the access conditions are not suitable the memory of the mobile device includes a policy or application access database which is used to store a list of access conditions that are inappropriate for launching the installed applications. In embodiments the access conditions are based on the type of the current access network used by the mobile device for launching or maintaining the requested application session. For example the access conditions may indicate whether the mobile device is currently accessing its home network or roaming on another provider s network. Similarly the access conditions may indicate the type of network access interface used by the current network to provide the data connection necessary to run the requested application. The policy database correlates predetermined actions with current status of access conditions associated with a given application session. In one embodiment when the mobile device accesses a network having an access technology specification with insufficient data handling capabilities for the requested application the mobile device denies access to the data intensive application or service specified in the policy database. Similarly to avoid unwanted roaming charges the mobile device s policy database includes instructions to suspend any scheduled firmware updates via a firmware over the air FOTA application until the mobile device returns to its home network.

In one aspect of the invention a method is provided for controlling access to an application the application capable of running on a mobile device by connecting to an access network the method comprising registering the application with the mobile device populating a record on the mobile device the record specifying one or more conditions for controlling access to the application the one or more conditions associated with the access network monitoring the one or more conditions and controlling access to the application from the mobile device based on the one or more conditions.

In another aspect of the invention a mobile device is provided the mobile device capable of running an application by connecting to an access network the mobile device comprising a processor a wireless interface for connecting to the access network and a computer readable medium having thereon instructions for registering the application with the mobile device populating a record on the mobile device the record specifying one or more conditions for controlling access to the application the one or more conditions associated with the access network monitoring the one or more conditions and controlling access to the application from the mobile device based on the one or more conditions.

In still another aspect of the invention a system is provided for controlling access to an application the application capable of running on a mobile device by connecting to an access network the system comprising a the mobile device capable of storing a record for specifying one or more conditions for controlling access to the application the one or more conditions associated with the access network the mobile device comprising an access network monitor module configured to monitor the one or more conditions and an application manager module configured to control access to the application from the mobile device based on the one or more conditions reported by the access network monitor module and b a device management server having a management connection to the mobile device for populating the record.

The following examples further illustrate the invention but of course should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.

Turning to an implementation of a system contemplated by an embodiment of the invention is shown with reference to a mobile network environment. In the illustrated embodiment the user device is a mobile device such as a wireless telephone or a portable computer capable of launching an application by connecting to an application server via one or more access networks . The application server is responsible for content delivery to the one or more applications running on a mobile device . For example when the mobile device includes a multimedia streaming application the application server employs a Real Time Transfer Protocol RTP to stream the requested content to the multimedia streaming application launched on the mobile device . In this embodiment the application server is part of a core network which is an IP Multimedia Services IMS network responsible for session control and Quality of Service QoS management of ongoing application sessions. Alternately the application server is located outside of the core network whereby the core network connects to the application server via the Internet . In embodiments where the IMS core network is not implemented the application server may be part of one of the access networks for example or it may connect to the access networks via the Internet .

As illustrated in the access networks interface with the mobile device in accordance with a network interface specification . Preferably the network interface specification complies with one or more wireless access standards each having corresponding data handling capabilities such as average and maximum uplink downlink throughput speeds. In embodiments the wireless network standards include CDMA 2000 1X 1xEV DO 1xEV DV EDGE and HSPDA network technologies or combinations thereof In order to launch the application the mobile device typically accesses its home network . However when the access network is not available such as when the mobile device travels outside of its home coverage area the mobile device is capable of launching the application via a roaming network .

Turning to embodiments of the mobile device and networks are provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention wherein the mobile device controls access to one or more applications based on access conditions associated with the access networks . The mobile device is capable of launching one or more applications from its memory. The applications include multimedia voice email instant messaging text messaging firmware update or any other applications or services requiring access to the home network or roaming network to establish an application session. In the illustrated embodiment the memory of the mobile device includes a Firmware Update Over the Air FOTA application a Voice over IP VoIP application and a video streaming application .

To prevent one or more applications or services from running when the access conditions are not suitable the memory of the mobile device includes a policy or application access database which is used to store a list of access conditions that are inappropriate for launching the applications . Specifically the access conditions are based on the type of the current access network used by the mobile device for launching or maintaining the requested application session . For example the access conditions may indicate whether the mobile device is currently accessing its home network or roaming on the network . Similarly the access conditions may indicate the type of network access interface or standard used by the current network to provide data connection necessary to run the application . The following table illustrates an example of the policy database having a list of applications and corresponding access conditions which in this embodiment are designated as inappropriate for allowing access to the listed applications or services.

Alternatively the database may contain a list of application access condition pairs under which access to the requested applications or services is allowed. In embodiments the policy database includes application types such as video streaming and or associated application names such as Windows Media Player for example. As illustrated above the policy database correlates predetermined actions with current status of access conditions associated with a given application session. When the mobile device registers with an access network having a network access technology specification with insufficient data handling capabilities for the requested application the mobile device is instructed to deny access to a data intensive application or service specified in the database or lookup table . For example the mobile device is instructed to deny access to a video streaming or VoIP application session when the access conditions indicate that the mobile device is currently using a CDMA 2000 1x network access technology. This avoids unnecessary use of network resources which under current access conditions are incapable of providing a satisfying user experience for the desired application. On the other hand if the current access conditions do not match those in the policy database such as when the mobile device is registered with an EVDO access network a user is granted full access to the desired video streaming or VoIP applications. Similarly to avoid unwanted roaming charges the policy database includes instructions to suspend any scheduled firmware updates via a FOTA application until the mobile device returns to the home network .

Preferably the policy database is populated by a network provider using conventional Over the Air Device Management OTA DM technology to provide the network operator with full control over the contents of the database . In an embodiment the policy database is centrally populated distributed and updated over the air for each mobile device via a management console connected to a device management server . The network provider may choose to distribute the policy database according to different classes of mobile devices wherein each device class designates the types of access networks accessible to the device as well as the types of applications installed in its memory. The management console as well as the device management server are located within the home access network or may be collocated with the network administration equipment at a network operations center NOC or at a mobile switching center MSC for example.

As further illustrated in to gain access to the network resources the application registers with an application manager . Specifically when a user attempts to launch an application the application supplies its name and or type information to the application manager which in turn receives an input of the monitored access conditions from the access network monitor . The application manager queries the policy database for the corresponding application access condition entry and denies access to the application if a match is found. Otherwise the mobile device initiates the application session over the current access network . In a further embodiment the access network monitor continues to report the changes in current access conditions during the application session to allow the application manager to terminate the application when a change in the access conditions matches an entry in the policy database .

In this embodiment the application manager and the access network monitor are implemented as Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW software modules exposing standard interfaces for interaction with other software components of the mobile device via an application programming interface API . Other embodiments of the application manager and access network monitor include using a Java based implementation capable of running on a plurality of mobile phone operating systems such as Symbian Windows Mobile Edition or Palm for example.

Turning to an embodiment of a method for controlling access to applications from a mobile device is illustrated with reference to an exemplary message flow scenario. In step the device management server updates the policy database when new applications or services are introduced by the network operator or pursuant to setting up a new customer account. In step when the user requests to launch a video streaming application the application registers with the application manager by providing it with its name and or type information such as Windows Media Player video streaming for example. This prompts the application manager to request and receive the current access condition information from the access network monitor steps . In this embodiment the access condition information includes information regarding the current access network such as roaming status and compatible network access technology. In steps based on the received application information the application manager requests and receives one or more entries from the policy database indicating which access conditions preclude the establishment of an application session for the application . In step the application manager allows the user to launch the requested application if the current access conditions do not match any of the entries returned by the policy database that require denial or suspension of access to the application. In this embodiment upon establishment of the application session the access network monitor continuously monitors any changes in the current access conditions. Therefore when in step the access network monitor detects a change in the access conditions for example when the mobile device migrates from an EVDO to a CDMA 2000 1X access network overlay it notifies the application manager accordingly. Since this change in the access conditions matches an entry received from the policy database requiring denial of access to the application the application manager in step sends an event to the application ending the current application session by forcing it to quit.
