This Application claims rights under 35 USC 119 e from U.S. Application Ser. No. 60 741 425 filed Dec. 1 2005 entitled Polycrystalline Heterostructure Infrared Detector the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. S02 13. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates to lead salt photodetectors and more particularly to midwave infrared lead salt photodetectors.

The achievement of near background limited for 180 degree field of view midwave infrared detector performance at room temperature mandates simultaneous responsivity signal and high impedance for low noise . Generally good responsivity is not compatible with high resistance and currently available room temperture photoconductive detectors often sacrifice response for high impedance due to the low mobility and lifetimes found in midwave semiconductors at these operating temperatures.

In the photodetector prior art air annealing of thin lead salt films and material compensation for impedance. The disadvantage of this procedure is that it may lead to surface damage and poor photoconductive gain.

There is therefore a need for improved photoconductors and methods of their manufacture that overcome the disadvantages of the prior art.

According to the present invention molecular beam epitaxy MBE is employed to grow a heterostructure photoconductive detector with a wide gap surface layer that creates a surface channel for minority carriers that enhances room temperature lifetimes by orders of magnitude over bulk polycrystalline material. This method is superior to the normal practice of surface oxidation as it provides more control over the surface potential and results in less damage to the semiconductor surface and hence longer carrier lifetimes . This heterostructure results in a depletion layer that results in higher detector impedance without sacrifice of photoconductive gain.

Referring to the photodetector includes a surface oxide layer with fixed positive charges as at and . Beneath the surface oxide layer there is a wide gap cap which is superimposed over a surface channel . Beneath the surface channel there is a depletion region that is in the PbSe p type layer and is depleted of majority carriers. There is a current flow in the depletion region . The majority carrier current flow is in the PbSe that is not depleted. The channel at the surface keeps the minority carriers from re combining too quickly lifetime enhancement . At the opposed ends of the depletion region and the PbSe p type layer there are metal contacts and which are attached to the PbSe. The entire described photoconductor is superimposed on a substrate . The minority carrier lifetime is enhanced at the surface due to exclusion of majority carriers by the built in electric field.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the depletion region is created by the fixed positive charge as at and in the surface oxide layer and that minority carrier electron lifetime is enhanced in surface channel so that the depletion field separates electron hole pairs and draws electrons to the channel. The depleted layer yields lower dark current sub intrinsic carrier concentration .

It will also be appreciated that the heterostructure creates minority carrier channel at surface leading to enhanced photoconductive gain. Surface depletion increases device impedance and results in lower noise. These conditions are not mutually exclusive and result in improved detector sensitivity.

While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications or additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims.
