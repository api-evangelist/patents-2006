title: Artillery charge with laser ignition
abstract: An artillery charge includes a generally cylindrical body with a hollow core; propellant disposed in the body and first energetic material disposed in the hollow core; and a seal disposed over one end of the hollow core, the seal including second energetic material disposed therein. A laser igniter ignites the second energetic material in the seal, thereby providing more reliable ignition of the first energetic material and the propellant. The artillery charge reliably ignites using a lower powered laser than known charges.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to artillery charges that are ignited with a laser.

Modular artillery charges are known for example from U.S. Pat. No. 5 747 723 issued on May 5 1998 which is hereby incorporated by reference. is a schematic sectional view of a modular artillery charge . Charge comprises a generally cylindrical body with a hollow core . Propellant is disposed in body . A core igniter bag filled with energetic material is disposed in the hollow core . The ends of the hollow core are typically enlarged in a conical shape. The enlarged ends hold end igniter bags that are filled with energetic material. The enlarged ends are sealed from the environment by a pair of seals . Each seal is usually a piece of thin transparent waterproof material such as Mylar. The seal is attached to the end of body using for example an adhesive .

The charge is loaded in a gun and ignited by a laser. Because the ends of charge are identical either end may be used for ignition. The laser beam passes through the seal and ignites the energetic material in end igniter bag . The energetic material in end igniter bag then ignites core igniter bag which ignites the propellant . However the ignition process is not without problems. is an enlarged schematic side view of one end of the charge . End igniter bag includes stitches . If the stitches of the end igniter bag are misaligned they become drawn too far into the centerline of charge . The laser then impinges on the stitches of the end igniter bag resulting in delayed or no ignition of the energetic material in igniter bag .

It is an object of the invention to provide a laser ignited artillery charge that has greater firing reliability.

It is another object of the invention to provide a laser ignited artillery charge that is reliably ignited with less laser power than known charges.

One aspect of the invention is an artillery charge comprising a generally cylindrical body with a hollow core propellant disposed in the body and first energetic material disposed in the hollow core and a seal disposed over one end of the hollow core the seal including second energetic material disposed therein. The first energetic material may be disposed in bags the bags including a core igniter bag disposed in the hollow core and an end igniter bag disposed in the one end of the hollow core.

In one embodiment the second energetic material comprises one or more of black powder MIC and MIC 10. Preferably the seal comprises a thin transparent waterproof material.

Another aspect of the invention is a method comprising providing an artillery charge comprising a generally cylindrical body with a hollow core propellant disposed in the body and first energetic material disposed in the hollow core placing a seal over one end of the hollow core the seal including second energetic material disposed therein and initiating the second energetic material in the seal with a laser. The first energetic material may be disposed in bags the bags including a core igniter bag disposed in the hollow core and an end igniter bag disposed in the one end of the hollow core.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention relates to the interface between the laser igniter and the propelling charge in an artillery weapon for example a 155 mm howitzer. The invention is a new configuration for a propelling charge that makes the propelling charge more reactive to laser energy. The invention enhances the optical coupling between the laser igniter and the propelling charge. In one embodiment the invention uses the basic configuration of a modular artillery charge shown in .

The energetic material may be secured to seal by a variety of means. For example a second seal or cover may be applied to the inside of seal over the energetic material to form a pocket. The cover is made of a thin transparent material such as Mylar. The energetic material may comprise one or more of for example black powder metastable intermolecular composite MIC or MIC 10.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
