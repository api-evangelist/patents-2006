title: Petawatt pulsed-power accelerator
abstract: A petawatt pulsed-power accelerator can be driven by various types of electrical-pulse generators, including conventional Marx generators and linear-transformer drivers. The pulsed-power accelerator can be configured to drive an electrical load from one- or two-sides. Various types of loads can be driven; for example, the accelerator can be used to drive a high-current z-pinch load. When driven by slow-pulse generators (e.g., conventional Marx generators), the accelerator comprises an oil section comprising at least one pulse-generator level having a plurality of pulse generators; a water section comprising a pulse-forming circuit for each pulse generator and a level of monolithic triplate radial-transmission-line impedance transformers, that have variable impedance profiles, for each pulse-generator level; and a vacuum section comprising triplate magnetically insulated transmission lines that feed an electrical load. When driven by LTD generators or other fast-pulse generators, the need for the pulse-forming circuits in the water section can be eliminated.

This invention was made with Government support under contract no. DE AC04 94AL85000 awarded by the U.S. Department of Energy to Sandia Corporation. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to pulsed power technology and in particular to a pulsed power accelerator that can deliver about 10 TW to more than 1000 TW of electrical power to a load. The accelerator architecture can also be used to produce electrical powers of substantially less than 10 TW.

A number of high current pulsed power accelerators have been developed by the international pulsed power community. Many of these accelerators have been optimized to drive z pinch loads. These z pinch accelerators have been used for a wide variety of inertial confinement fusion ICF radiation physics equation of state plasma physics astrophysics and other high energy density physics HEDP experiments.

Presently the z pinch driver that operates at the highest electrical power is the Z accelerator which is located at Sandia National Laboratories. See R. B. Spielman et al. 11IEEE Int. Pulsed Power Conf. IEEE Piscataway N.J. p. 709 1997 . The Z accelerator delivers 55 terawatts TW of electrical power to the accelerator s vacuum insulator stack and 19 megamperes MA to a 10 mm initial radius 10 mm length pinch that implodes in 95 nanoseconds ns . Such a z pinch radiates 130 TW of x ray power in a 10 ns pulse. See R. B. Spielman et al. 5 2105 1998 .

Recent calculations suggest that accelerators with electrical powers in excess of 1000 TW i.e. in excess of one petawatt will be required to drive z pinch implosions that radiate in excess of 1000 TW of x ray power. Such radiated powers would enable large diameter ICF capsule implosion experiments and other HEDP experiments to be conducted over heretofore inaccessible parameter regimes. See W. A. Stygar et al. 72 026404 2005 .

A number of architectures have been proposed in the literature for the design of future pulsed power z pinch drivers. These architectures are described in the following references C. L.

These prior pulsed power accelerator architectures are capable of being scaled to deliver electrical powers in excess of a petawatt. However the new architecture described below is significantly more efficient and hence is less expensive than any of these prior architectures.

The present invention is directed to a pulsed power accelerator comprising the following cylindrically concentric sections i An oil section comprising one or more stacked levels of pulse generators. Each pulse generator level comprises a plurality of pulse generators. Each pulse generator can be for example a Marx generator one or more capacitors a linear transformer driver LTD a linear inductive voltage adder IVA or a dielectric cavity adder. The pulse generators include the initial electrical energy storage system of the accelerator and each pulse generator generates a forward going power pulse. ii A water section comprising stacked monolithic triplate radial transmission line impedance transformers. There is one such radial line transformer for each of the pulse generator levels. The water section can further comprise an intermediate pulse forming circuit between each pulse generator and the associated radial line transformer to further increase shorten shape or otherwise form the forward going power pulse. The pulse forming circuit can comprise one or more intermediate store capacitors or a Blumlein circuit with associated output switches for each pulse generator. For example the intermediate stores can be pulse charged to a high voltage by a Marx generator. After the intermediate stores are pulse charged each intermediate store is discharged through the one or more switches to produce an electrical output pulse. The switches can be for example gas switches that can be triggered either electrically or by a laser. Alternatively the switches can be self break liquid or solid dielectric or semiconductor switches. On each level the forward going power pulses generated by the pulse generators or formed by the intermediate pulse forming circuits are combined at the input to the triplate radial line. The impedance at the input of the radial line preferably maximizes the transfer of electrical power from the pulse generators or the intermediate pulse forming circuits to the radial line. The combined pulse propagates in the radial line toward the center of the accelerator in a radially converging manner. The impedance of the radial line increases as the radius decreases. An approximately exponential impedance profile maximizes the power and energy transport efficiency of the radial line. iii A vacuum section located at the center of the accelerator comprising stacked triplate vacuum transmission lines. There is one such stacked triplate vacuum transmission line for each water insulated triplate radial transmission line impedance transformer for delivering the combined radially converging power pulse to an electrical load. The electrical output of each triplate radial line transformer is connected to the input of one of the triplate vacuum transmission lines. The impedance at the output of the radial line preferably maximizes the transfer of power from the output of the radial line to the triplate vacuum transmission line. Each triplate vacuum transmission line comprises two vacuum insulators which are electrically in parallel and which form the water vacuum interface and two magnetically insulated transmission lines MITLs that are also electrically in parallel. The vacuum section can further comprise a post hole vacuum convolute that adds the currents at the outputs of two or more stacked MITLs and delivers the combined current to the electrical load. The electrical load can be a z pinch or another electrical load located at the center of the accelerator. The pulsed power accelerator can be single sided to drive the electrical load from one side or two sided to drive the electrical load from two sides.

The petawatt pulsed power accelerator of the present invention can be driven by various types of electrical pulse generators. Described herein are specific examples of accelerators driven by conventional slow Marx generators and by fast linear transformer drivers. The accelerator can have an intermediate pulse forming circuit between each pulse generator and the associated radial line transformer to further form the forward going power pulses generated by the pulse generators before they are combined in the radial line. The pulsed power accelerator can be used to drive an electrical load from one or two sides. General descriptions of these different accelerator embodiments are provided below.

A specific example is provided below of a single sided Marx based pulsed power accelerator that can produce a 100 ns 500 TW electrical power pulse which is an order of magnitude greater than the electrical power presently achieved on the Z accelerator. Another example provided below describes a single sided Marx based accelerator that can produce a 250 ns 460 TW electrical power pulse. A third example describes a two sided Marx based accelerator that provides two parallel output transmission lines. Such a two sided accelerator can be used to power two z pinches in a double pinch driven hohlraum for ICF capsule implosions or to power any other load that requires a two sided drive. The two sided example described below can produce an approximately 100 ns 680 TW power pulse. A fourth example provided below describes an LTD based pulsed power accelerator that has some advantages over an accelerator driven by Marx generators.

In is shown a schematic illustration of an exemplary single sided pulsed power accelerator . Like that of many other z pinch drivers the pulsed power accelerator comprises an oil section a water section and a vacuum section . The water section is located within the oil section and the vacuum section lies within the water section . The three sections and preferably have cylindrical geometries and can be concentric about a symmetry axis within a cylindrical tank . An insulating oil water interface separates the oil section from the water section . A vacuum insulator stack separates the water section from the vacuum section .

The oil section comprises at least one pulse generator level having a plurality of pulse generators . Additional levels and of pulse generators can be stacked on the bottom level to provide multiple stacked pulse generator levels. The outer diameter of the oil section and the number of pulse generator levels can be determined by the desired number of pulse generators which depends on the desired amount of initial energy storage. The exemplary single sided accelerator shown in comprises three pulse generator levels and . The number of levels can be increased to increase the current delivered to the electrical load.

The pulse generators are the initial electrical energy storage system of the accelerator . Typically the pulse generator can be a Marx generator which comprises a plurality of capacitors that are slow charged in parallel and discharged in series thereby generating a high voltage forward going power pulse. For example a Marx generator on the Z accelerator comprises many capacitors that are charged in parallel to about 90 kilovolts in about 90 seconds and discharged in series to provide an approximately 1 microsecond 5 megavolt forward going power pulse. Alternatively the pulse generator can be one or more capacitors a pulse transformer a linear IVA a dielectric cavity adder an LTD generator or other type of generator capable of generating a high voltage power pulse.

The water section of the pulsed power accelerator comprises an intermediate pulse forming circuit for each pulse generator . The pulse forming circuit is pulse charged by the pulse generator and can increase shorten shape or otherwise form the forward going power pulse. The pulse forming circuit can comprise one or more water dielectric intermediate store capacitors for each pulse generator and one or more switches for each intermediate store . The switches can be for example gas switches that are triggered either electrically or by a laser. This type of pulse forming circuit on the Z accelerator provides an approximately 200 ns forward going output pulse. Other types of pulse forming circuits such as a Blumlein circuit can also be used. The water section further comprises one monolithic triplate radial transmission line impedance transformer for each pulse generator level or . The water section shown in has 3 levels of triplate intermediate store capacitors a single switch per intermediate store and 3 levels of monolithic triplate radial transmission line impedance transformers.

The variable impedance triplate radial transmission line transformers of the present invention are similar to the biplate radial transformer of Petr et al. for generating a high voltage pulse applicable to particle acceleration. See R. A. Petr et al. 59 132 1988 which is incorporated herein by reference. The inner conductor of each triplate radial line is a cathode. The outer conductors of each triplate radial line are anodes. The radial lines use a water dielectric and have variable impedance profiles. Preferably the impedance profile is approximately exponential and can be chosen to optimize the power and energy transport efficiencies of the accelerator. The anode cathode AK gaps of the triplate radial lines are shown in as being independent of radius. However the actual gaps would vary with radius to provide the desired impedance profile.

In the examples described below the variable impedance radial transmission line transformers are assumed to have exponential impedance profiles i.e that

The intermediate stores are pulse charged by the pulse generators as the pulse generators erect. When the voltage across the intermediate stores is near its peak value the switches can be triggered launching electrical power pulses at the input to the monolithic radial lines. A radially converging power pulse subsequently propagates in the radial line transformers toward the vacuum section which is located at the center of the accelerator. Therefore the radial lines combine the outputs of the plurality of pulse generators to produce a single electrical pulse at the vacuum insulator stack.

The vacuum section comprises a level of triplate vacuum transmission lines for each level or of pulse generators . Each triplate vacuum transmission line comprises two vacuum insulators which are electrically in parallel that form the water vacuum interface and two MITLs that are also electrically in parallel and form a triplate MITL . Depending on the number of vacuum transmission line levels and the type of electrical load the triplate MITLs can feed a post hole vacuum convolute that in turn feeds the load . The convolute adds the output current of each of the triplate MITLs and delivers the combined current to the load . The pulsed power accelerator can be used with a variety of electrical loads. In particular the accelerator can be used as a high current z pinch driver.

The vacuum section in the example shown in comprises a vacuum insulator stack 3 triplate MITLs a triple post hole vacuum convolute and a z pinch load. The stack and MITLs have 3 levels to match the 3 triplate radial line levels in the water section and the 3 pulse generator levels in the oil section. The currents at the outputs of the MITLs are added by the triple post hole vacuum convolute the combined current is delivered by the convolute to the z pinch load. The triple post hole convolute is a straightforward extension of the double post hole convolute. See R. B. Spielman et al. 7. IEEE Piscataway N.J. p. 445 1989 and T. D. Pointon et al. 8 4534 2001 .

The large diameter monolithic radial transmission line impedance transformers provide many advantages over prior architectures for high current z pinch accelerators. Some of these advantages are listed as follows 

For a given application the optimum parameters of the accelerator components shown in can be best determined through iterative numerical simulations. To begin such simulations initial estimates of the parameters would be required. Estimates that are accurate to at most first order are presented below.

For the description below it is assumed that a Marx based pulsed power accelerator that uses intermediate pulse forming lines comprising intermediate store capacitors and laser triggered gas switches is being designed to drive a z pinch load. A desired peak pinch current pinch implosion time pinch length and initial pinch radius are given by I and R respectively. These parameters determine the required pinch mass m which is given approximately by the following expression 

The desired values of I and determine the required values of the peak electrical power at the vacuum insulator stack Pand peak stack voltage V according to

The constants on the right hand sides of Eqs. 2 5 can only be accurate when the shape of the pinch current stack power and stack voltage pulses are mathematically similar to the shapes assumed for the analysis by Stygar et al. The constants above are 5 less than those assumed by Stygar et al. since more recent stack MITL system designs for petawatt class drivers suggest that the required minimum inductance L can be about 5 less than assumed previously. In addition Eq. 5 implicitly assumes the use of anode plugs in the insulator stack. See W. A. Stygar et al. 8 050401 2005 . Eq. 5 also assumes that the stack flashover probability is limited to less than 10 as predicted by the statistical flashover model developed by W. A. Stygar et al. in 7 070401 2004 .

The electrical power Pis delivered to the stack MITL vacuum section by the water section radial line transformers. The impedance at the output of the radial lines Zthat maximizes the transfer of electrical energy from these lines to the stack MITL section is approximately

The single sided accelerator shown in arbitrarily assumes 6 water section radial lines i.e. 3 triplates which are electrically in parallel. For an accelerator with nwater section radial lines the impedance at the output of the radial lines i.e. at the outer radius of the vacuum insulator stack is given by the following 

The electric field in the water radial lines is highest near their output i.e. just outside the vacuum insulator stack. To minimize the probability of water dielectric breakdown in this region the peak value in time of the mean electric field at the radial line output Emust satisfy the following relation 1.13 10 8 where

Equation 9 uses the peak voltage at the stack. The peak voltage in the radial lines is actually higher about 10 50 ns outside the stack in the water due the voltage that is reflected from the stack. However for systems of interest the radial line AK gaps are also larger in this region. In addition the effective pulse width of the voltage is shorter here than at the stack. Numerical calculations suggest that for systems of interest if the criterion given by Eq. 8 is met at the stack it will also be met near the stack.

When Eq. 6 is satisfied and the radial line output impedance is well matched to the stack MITL inductance at z pinch implosion times of interest then P P 11 where

Since the radial lines are impedance transformers they approximately conserve electrical power. Hence

Power is delivered to the input of the radial line transformers from the intermediate store capacitors. The radial line input impedance Zthat maximizes the transfer of power from the intermediate stores to the radial lines is given by 14 where Zis the output impedance of the system of intermediate stores and

The intermediate stores are typically charged on a time scale that is long compared to the time required to close the switches. Hence the peak value of the intermediate store voltage Vcan be assumed to be the same throughout the store s length and that at peak voltage the peak forward going voltage in the intermediate stores is V 2. Using this assumption the peak forward going voltage at the input to the radial lines Vis approximately

The intermediate stores receive their energy from the Marx generators. It is straightforward to show that the transfer of energy from the Marxes to the intermediate stores is maximized when

When Eqs. 24 and 25 are satisfied then V V nV 26 where Vis the maximum peak voltage that can be achieved by the erected Marx generators and Vis the initial DC voltage to which each of the Marx capacitors is charged. The required value of the total initial energy stored in the Marx generators Ecan be expressed as 

Additional information needs to be provided to close the above system of equations. For the exemplary single sided 100 ns 500 TW accelerator described below the following simplifying assumptions are made 80 28 n 6 29 0.8 30 

As indicated by Eqs. 7 17 and 18 the required value of a radial line s anode cathode gap increases as . Hence water is an attractive insulating medium since its high dielectric constant about 80 reduces considerably the electric field in the radial lines and intermediate stores.

The single sided 100 ns 500 TW accelerator assumes 6 radial line transformers i.e. 3 triplates Eq. 29 . For comparison the Z accelerator successfully uses in effect 4 transmission lines. A detailed study would be required to determine the optimum value of nfor a given set of conditions.

The power efficiency of the radial line transformers Eq. 30 is a function of the impedance ratio of the transformers Z Z the distance over which the impedance transformation is performed the shape of the impedance profile the shape of the power pulse and the water resistivity. Hence the efficiency is best determined numerically. For the 100 ns 500 TW accelerator example considered below the power efficiency of the transformer system when terminated in a matched load was determined from numerical simulations to be 82 .

Equations 31 and 32 assume that the inductance and characteristic resistance of each switch is 400 nH and 200 m respectively. The quantity nis the total number of switches that can be installed in the accelerator which is determined by r i the radius at which the switches are located and various engineering and operational constraints. In addition to these constraints it is preferable to have an integral number of switches per intermediate store capacitor. For the accelerators described herein Eq. 33 can be safely assumed.

Equation 34 makes the simplifying assumption that the gas switches can be operated reliably when the peak intermediate store voltage is 5 MV which is approximately at the operating point of the laser triggered gas switches used in the Z accelerator. Equation 35 is obtained from numerical circuit simulations. Equation 36 assumes that each Marx generator consists of 60 capacitors and Eq. 37 assumes each Marx capacitor has a capacitance of 1.34 p F. Equation 38 assumes each Marx capacitor is initially charged to 90 kV. Equations 36 38 are essentially identical to the Marx parameters of the Z accelerator.

Although not directly relevant to the electrical design of an accelerator it is useful to obtain an estimate of the outer radius of the accelerator s oil tank. For the Marx based accelerators considered herein the minimum value of the outer tank radius ris approximately given by 6.5 m. 39 

Most of the above assumptions are also used for the exemplary single sided 250 ns 460 TW accelerator and in addition the two sided 100 ns 680 TW accelerator described below. Deviations from Eqs. 28 38 are described below in the descriptions of these accelerators.

The above equations can be used to determine how the peak pinch current I scales with other accelerator parameters. Combining Eqs. 3 and 11 13 and assuming is approximately constant for accelerators of interest the following expression is obtained I P . 40 Combining Eqs. 13 14 21 24 27 and 40 and assuming

Assuming Eqs. 13 14 18 21 and 40 42 and also that V g 44 in order to satisfy Eq. 22 a relation between I V r and can be obtained I Vr . 45 Hence Eqs. 39 and 45 suggest that for a given pinch current I and implosion time the outer tank radius rcan be decreased if the intermediate store voltage Vis increased.

As described above there are several transfers of electrical power from one accelerator component to another. None of these transfers occurs with perfect efficiency. Equations 40 43 and 45 do not account for any transfer efficiencies hence these scaling relations implicitly assume that these efficiencies remain constant for systems of interest.

The single sided Marx based pulsed power accelerator architecture shown in was used to design a z pinch driver that produces a 100 ns 500 TW electrical power pulse. The accelerator parameters for this design are summarized in columns A1 A2 and A3 of Table I. The accelerator architecture is identical for these three examples the only difference between these is the design of the z pinch load.

Iterative numerical circuit simulations were performed to develop an optimized circuit model of the accelerator. Initial estimates of the accelerator circuit parameters which were used for the simulations were determined assuming Eqs. 2 38 the desired z pinch parameters that were assumed are as follows I 45 MA 46 90 ns 47 10 mm 48 R 10 mm. 49 Equations 46 49 correspond to the z pinch parameters of Example A1. The simulations were conducted using the SCREAMER circuit code. The z pinch load is modeled in SCREAMER as an imploding cylindrical foil with perfectly stable and infinitely thin walls. See M. L. Kiefer and M. M. Widner 5. IEEE Piscataway N.J. p. 685 1985 .

A circuit to satisfy approximately the constraints given by Eqs. 5 29 31 33 38 and 46 49 was developed. The numerical simulations did not assume Eq. 28 but instead that the switch resistance falls from a high initial value to 200 m in an exponential decay with a 10 ns time constant. Under these constraints the optimum values of r r r r Z Z Z and Zwere numerically determined. The optimum values were defined to be those which maximize the efficiency of delivering energy from the Marx generators to the z pinch load. The optimum values are approximately as follows r 45.4 m 50 r r 43.9 m 51 r 2.7 m 52 Z 8.9 m 53 Z 9.2 m 54 Z 16.2 m 55 Z 250 m . 56 For the conditions described above the required number of Marx generators nis 300. If there are two intermediate store capacitors per Marx the impedance of each store is 5.4 .

The analytic accelerator model described above assumes a transformer efficiency of 0.8 Eq. 30 . The numerical simulations did not make this assumption but instead included a 1D model of the transformer and calculated the actual transformer efficiency. The numerical calculations included effects due the exponential impedance profile and in addition the water resistivity.

As indicted in Table I the circuit model assumes that the water resistivity is 3.0 M cm. This is a factor of two higher than the nominal resistivity routinely achieved on the Z accelerator. Presently the Z accelerator water is processed using resin beds. However the use of a reverse osmosis electric discharge ionization treatment is expected to routinely provide resistivities on the order of 3.0 M cm even though the water volume of the higher power accelerators considered here would be a factor of about 20 greater than it is for Z.

When the water resistivity is 3.0 M cm the numerical simulations show that the intrinsic power efficiency of the radial line transformer described above is 82 . This is the efficiency obtained when the transformer is terminated in a matched load. When the water resistivity is assumed to be infinite the power efficiency increases to 88 . The corresponding energy efficiencies of the transformer are 80 and 86 respectively.

Once an optimized accelerator circuit was developed for Example A1 this circuit was used to drive two other z pinch loads and in this manner Examples A2 and A3 were developed. The pinch geometry for Example A2 was identical to that of A1 however the pinch mass of A2 was chosen to be that which gives a 120 ns implosion time. The pinch of Example A3 had twice the length of Example A1 the mass was chosen to achieve the same implosion time as for Example A1.

The numerical simulations predicted that for these three examples the peak values in time of the power voltage and energy at the stack and the peak pinch current are as listed in Table I. In is plotted the time dependent stack current pinch current stack voltage and stack energy for Example A1. The peak pinch current before pinch stagnation is 46 MA the peak stack voltage is 14 MV and the electromagnetic energy delivered to the stack by the time the pinch stagnates on axis is 33 MJ. The simulations made the simplifying assumption that electron flow effects in the MITLs can be modeled according to the model of Struve et al. and that Z 0.5 ohms. See K. W. Struve et al. 11. p. 162 1997 . Also listed in Table I are the predicted pinch implosion velocities and kinetic energies.

Experiments conducted on the Z accelerator demonstrate that the total x ray energy radiated by a pinch with the parameters listed in the Z accelerator column of Table I is 1.6 MJ a factor of 2.46 greater than the nominal pinch kinetic energy of 0.65 MJ given in the table. This factor of 2.46 was assumed to estimate the total radiated x ray yields for Examples A1 A2 and A3.

The single sided Marx based pulsed power accelerator architecture shown in was also applied to the design of a 250 ns 460 TW z pinch driver. The accelerator parameters assumed for this design are summarized in the column labeled Example B of Table I.

Example B was developed to determine how much the pinch current increases if the total Marx energy E capacitance of each Marx capacitor C and pinch implosion time are increased a factor of about 2 above the levels of Examples A1 A2 and A3 to the following values E 195 MJ 57 C 2.68 F 58 240 ns. 59 Assuming these three constraints and the constraints imposed by Eqs. 5 29 33 34 36 38 48 and 49 iterative SCREAMER circuit simulations were performed to develop an optimized accelerator circuit. Instead of using Eq. 31 the following was assumed

The performance parameters of the optimized circuit for Example B are summarized in Table I. Since Example B had the same number of switches as Examples A1 A2 and A3 each switch of Example B transferred approximately twice the charge per switch per shot as do the other three examples.

As indicated by Table I the pinch current of Example B was a factor of 1.63 greater than it was for Example A1. This ratio agrees to first order with Eq. 43 which predicts an increase of a factor of 1.69. The pinch of Example B can radiate at least twice as much x ray energy as either Examples A1 A2 or A3.

Since Examples A1 A2 A3 and B all assume the architecture shown in they provide a single power feed to a z pinch load. Successful operation of a double pinch driven hohlraum for ICF may however ultimately require two parallel feeds.

An architecture for a pulsed power accelerator that provides a two sided drive is shown in . The two sided accelerator comprises a bottom side accelerator B and a top side accelerator T that operate in parallel each of which has an architecture similar to that of the single sided accelerator described above. The two sided accelerator comprises an oil section a water section and a vacuum section that can be concentric about a symmetry axis within a cylindrical tank . An insulating oil water interface separates the oil section from the water section and a vacuum insulator stack separates the water section from the vacuum section . The oil section comprises at least one pulse generator level B having a plurality of pulse generators B on the bottom side B and at least one level T of pulse generators T on the top side T. The water section comprises pulse forming circuits B and T that can comprise one or more water dielectric intermediate store capacitors B and T for each pulse generator B and T and one or more switches B and T for each intermediate store capacitor B and T on the bottom and top sides B and T. The water section further comprises a level of monolithic triplate radial transmission line impedance transformers B and T for each pulse generator level B and T on the bottom and top sides B and T. Each triplate radial line B or T has a cathode and outer anodes . The radial line transformers have variable preferably approximately exponential impedance profiles. The AK gaps of the transformer lines B and T can vary radially to provide the variable impedance profile. The vacuum section comprises a level of triplate MITLs B and T for each pulse generator level B and T on the bottom and top sides B and T. The MITLs B on the bottom side B can feed a bottom side vacuum convolute B to drive a bottom side load B and the MITLs T on the top side T can feed a separate top side vacuum convolute T to drive a top side load T.

This two sided pulsed power accelerator architecture was applied to the design of Example C a two sided Marx based 100 ns z pinch driver that produces 340 TW of electrical power per side or 680 TW total. As indicated by and Table I Example C is essentially two parallel 4 level n 4 versions of Example A1. The accelerator and pinch parameters that are achieved when the accelerator circuit is optimized for this design are summarized in the column labeled Example C of Table I. Example C can deliver 39 MA to each of the two pinches which are electrically in parallel. This system is expected to radiate 7.6 MJ per pinch or a total of 15.2 MJ.

LTD technology is being developed and is becoming an attractive alternative to conventional Marx generators. See C. L. Olson Inertial confinement fusion z pinch Chapter 9 editor in chief W. Martienssen volume VIII 3 of Fusion Technologies edited by K. Heinloth Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005 M. G. Mazarakis et al. 13. IEEE Piscataway N.J. p. 587 2001 M. G. Mazarakis et al. to be published in the 15. IEEE Piscataway N.J. 2005 A. A. Kim and B. M. Kovaltchuk 1 Institute of High Current Electronics Tomsk Russia p. 263 2000 M. G. Mazarakis and R. B. Spielman 12. IEEE Piscataway N.J. p. 412 1999 and S. T. Rogowski et al. to be published in the 15. IEEE Piscataway N.J. 2005 . The LTD based architecture described herein differs from previous proposed LTD based accelerators since the previous designs assume that each LTD directly drives a long coaxial vacuum MITL. The long MITLs are operated in the self limited mode and are combined by a vacuum convolute that in turn drives a radial MITL section. Much of the flow electron current launched in the long coaxial MITLs is lost at the vacuum convolute. Conversely according to the present invention each LTD directly drives a coaxial liquid dielectric e.g. oil or water transmission line which in turn drives a water dielectric triplate radial transmission line impedance transformer which has an approximately exponential impedance profile. The several stacked levels of radial line transformers offer a straightforward and efficient method of combining the outputs of several hundred terawatt level LTDs to produce a petawatt level power pulse which in turn can be used to drive a z pinch implosion.

A pulsed power accelerator that does not use an intermediate pulse forming circuit is shown in . The accelerator comprises an oil section a water section and a vacuum section . The water section is located within the oil section and the vacuum section lies within the water section . The oil section is separated from the water section by an oil water interface and the water section is separated from the vacuum section by a vacuum insulator stack . The three sections and can lie within a cylindrical tank and can be concentric about a cylindrical symmetry axis . The pulsed power accelerator can be single sided as shown or two sided to drive an electrical load from one or two sides.

The oil section comprises at least one level of fast pulse generators . Preferably the fast pulse generator comprises an annular LTD pulse generator as shown but can also be a fast Marx generator or other pulse generator capable of generating a fast high voltage power pulse. Additional levels and can be stacked on the bottom level . The outer diameter of the oil section and the number of fast pulse generator levels can be determined by the required number of fast pulse generators . This in turn can be determined by the electrical power produced by each fast pulse generator and the total required electrical power. The specific example shown in assumes a single sided accelerator with three fast pulse generator levels.

The water section comprises a stacked monolithic triplate radial transmission line impedance transformer for each fast pulse generator level . The triplate radial lines have variable impedance profiles. The impedance profiles of the triplate radial lines are preferably approximately exponential. The radial lines perform the same functions for the pulsed power accelerator as they do for the pulsed power accelerators and described above. The fast pulse generators launch electrical power pulses at the input to the radial lines . A combined radially converging power pulse subsequently propagates in the radial lines toward the vacuum section which is located at the center of the accelerator . Importantly the water section of the accelerator is completely passive and does not use pulse forming circuits intermediate store capacitors or switches as are used in many conventional pulsed power accelerator designs.

The vacuum section comprises the vacuum insulator stack a triplate vacuum transmission line for each fast pulse generator level a vacuum convolute and an electrical load which can be a z pinch. The vacuum section shown in has 3 triplate MITLs to match the 3 triplate radial lines in the water section and the 3 fast pulse generator levels in the oil section. The currents at the outputs of the 3 triplate MITLs can be added by a triple post hole convolute the combined current can then be delivered by the convolute to the electrical load.

The fast LTD based architecture of the type shown in offers several advantages over the slower Marx based architecture of the type shown in the most significant are described below. Conventional slow Marx generators 1 s require additional pulse compression circuitry to achieve the fast 

Using existing technology a single LTD cavity that is 3 m in diameter can produce a 100 kV 1 MA 0.1 TW electrical power pulse. The full width at half maximum of the power pulse is about 100 ns. Each such LTD cavity is 20 cm long. When 60 cavities are stacked in series to form a 12 m long LTD pulse generator which is also referred to as an LTD module the module can produce a 6 TW electrical power pulse. Assuming a center to center spacing of LTD modules of 3.3 m and also assuming that the outer tank diameter is 104 m 70 LTDs can be fit in each of the 3 levels illustrated in for a total of 210 LTDs. The total forward going electrical power and energy launched at the input of the radial transmission line impedance transformers of such an LTD based accelerator is 1260 TW and 126 MJ respectively. Approximately 1000 TW would arrive at the vacuum insulator stack. Such a power pulse delivers about 60 MA to a 10 mm diameter 10 mm length z pinch that implodes in about 90 ns. Such a pinch would radiate about 17 MJ. These estimates are summarized in Table II.

Higher accelerator powers in excess of 1000 TW may be required to achieve z pinch driven ICF with thermonuclear yields in excess of 400 MJ. These powers can be achieved by conceptually straightforward upgrades to the example Marx based and LTD based accelerator designs described above.

Table I. Accelerator and z pinch parameters for several Marx based accelerator examples. The parameters are compared to those of the present Z accelerator. For Examples A1 A2 and A3 the accelerator architecture is identical the only difference between these is the design of the z pinch load. For the Z accelerator and all five higher current examples the initial pinch radius is assumed to be 10 mm. The nominal values of the peak pinch implosion velocity and kinetic energy assume a 10 1 pinch radius convergence ratio.

For both the Z and LTD accelerators the initial pinch radius is assumed to be 10 mm. The nominal values of the peak pinch kinetic energy assume a 10 1 pinch convergence ratio.
