title: Methods and apparatus for communicating changes between a user-interface and an executing application, using property paths
abstract: A method for detecting a change in a current state of a property associated with an element of a user-interface includes the step of associating the element with a property path including a concatenation of a plurality of identifiers defining a path through a plurality of application components to a property at the end of the concatenation. The property path is mapped to a current state of the property at the end of the path. A request is received, from a local machine, for a change in a state of a property mapped to one of said plurality of concatenated identifiers defining the property path. The request for the change is sent to a remote machine. The remote machine applies the change. The local machine updates the element of the user-interface associated with the property path responsive to the change and the received regeneration.
