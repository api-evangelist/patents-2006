This invention relates to an electrophotographic photosensitive member a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have the electrophotographic photosensitive member and also to a process for producing the electrophotographic photosensitive member.

In recent years research and development are energetically made on electrophotographic photosensitive members making use of organic photoconductive materials i.e. organic electrophotographic photosensitive members .

The electrophotographic photosensitive members are each basically constituted of a support and a photosensitive layer formed on the support. Under existing circumstances however various layers are often formed between the support and the photosensitive layer in order to e.g. cover defects on the support surface improve coating performance for the photosensitive layer improve the adhesiveness between the support and the photosensitive layer protect the photosensitive layer from electrical breakdown improve chargeability and improve the performance of blocking the injection of electric charges from the support to the photosensitive layer. Thus the layers to be formed between the support and the photosensitive layer are required to have many functions such as covering properties adhesiveness mechanical strength conductivity electrical barrier properties and so forth.

The layers to be provided between the support and the photosensitive layer are conventionally known to include the following types.

The type i layer contains no conductive material and hence the layer has a high resistivity. Moreover in order to cover defects on the support surface having not been subjected to surface smoothing treatment it must be formed in a large thickness layer thickness .

However if such a type i layer having a high resistivity is formed in a large layer thickness a problem may arise such that it brings about a high residual potential at the initial stage and during repeated use.

Accordingly in order for the type i layer to be put into practical use it is necessary to lessen defects on the support surface and also to form the layer in a small layer thickness.

On the other hand the type ii layer is a layer in which a conductive material such as conductive particles are dispersed in a resin and the layer can be made to have a low resistivity. Hence the layer may be formed in a large layer thickness so as to cover defects on the surface of a conductive support or a non conductive support such as a support made of a resin .

However where the type ii layer is formed in a large layer thickness the layer must be endowed with a sufficient conductivity compared with the type i layer to be formed in a small thickness and hence the type ii layer results in a layer having a low volume resistivity. Hence in order to block the injection of electric charges from the support and the type ii layer into the photosensitive layer which is causative of image defects under environmental conditions ranging broadly from low temperature and low humidity to high temperature and high humidity it is preferable that a layer having electrical barrier properties is additionally provided between the type ii layer and the photosensitive layer. Such a layer having electrical barrier properties is a resin layer containing no conductive material such as the type i layer.

That is the layer to be provided between the support and the photosensitive layer may preferably have the type iii constitution in which the type i layer and the type ii layer are superimposed one on another.

The type iii constitution requires formation of a plurality of layers and hence requires steps in a correspondingly larger number. However it has such an advantage that the tolerance for defects on the support surface can be of a wide range and hence the tolerance for the use of the support can be of a vastly wide range promising the achievement of improvement in productivity.

In general the type ii layer is called a conductive layer and the type i layer is called an intermediate layer a subbing layer or a barrier layer .

An aluminum pipe produced by a production process having an extrusion step and a drawing step and an aluminum pipe produced by a production process having an extrusion step and an ironing step are used as supports for electrophotographic photosensitive members which can achieve a good dimensional precision and surface smoothness as non cut pipes without requiring surface cutting and besides are advantageous in view of cost as well. However burr like protruding defects tend to occur on the surfaces of these aluminum non cut pipes. Thus from the viewpoint of covering surface defects of such supports too the type iii constitution is preferred.

As the conductive material used in the conductive layer it includes various metals metal oxides and conductive polymers. In particular tin oxide hereinafter also SnO having powder resistivity usually in the range of from 10to 10 cm is preferred as having superior resistivity characteristics. A conductive material is also available whose powder resistivity is reduced to 1 1 000 to 1 100 000 by mixing or doping when the SnOconductive material is produced a compound of a metal having a valence different from tin such as antimony oxide or a non metallic element. An oxygen deficient SnOconductive material is also available in which the resistivity of SnOhas been made to be as small as that of antimony doped materials without adding constituent elements and in a non doped state.

As prior art relating to oxygen deficient SnO Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. H07 295245 for example discloses a technique making use of oxygen deficient SnOin a conductive layer. Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. H06 208238 also discloses a technique in which barium sulfate particles are coated with oxygen deficient SnOso that dispersibility can be further improved than that in a case in which only SnOis used. Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. H10 186702 still also discloses a technique in which barium sulfate particles are used in order to improve dispersibility the particles being coated with titanium oxide TiO in order to improve whiteness and further coated with SnOin order to provide conductivity. This Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. H10 186702 however does not disclose any embodiments of the oxygen deficient SnO.

In recent years an electrophotographic apparatus has become widely used employing a contact charging system in which a voltage is applied to a charging member provided in contact with an electrophotographic photosensitive member i.e. a contact charging member to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member. In particular a system is prevalent in which a roller shaped contact charging member a charging roller is brought into contact with the surface of an electrophotographic photosensitive member and a voltage generated by superimposing an alternating current voltage on a direct current voltage is applied thereto to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member an AC DC contact charging system or in which only a direct current voltage is applied to the charging member to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member a DC contact charging system .

In the AC DC contact charging system there are disadvantages e.g. such that a direct current power source and an alternating current power source are required to bring about a rise in cost of the electrophotographic apparatus itself and that the size of electrophotographic apparatus becomes enlarged as compared with the case of the DC contact charging system. In addition there is such a disadvantage that alternating current consumed in a large quantity causes deterioration in durability of the contact charging member and electrophotographic apparatus.

Accordingly taking into account cost reduction compactness and high durability the DC contact charging system can be said to be more preferred.

However electrophotographic apparatus employing the DC contact charging system tend to become inferior in the uniformity of the surface potential of the electrophotographic photosensitive member at the time of charging i.e. charging uniformity to electrophotographic apparatus employing the AC DC contact charging system. Accordingly faulty images caused by non uniform charging and appearing in non uniform lines in the lengthwise direction the direction perpendicular to the peripheral direction of the electrophotographic photosensitive member hereinafter also charging lines are apt to bring about a problem in halftone images or the like.

In regard to such a problem a proposal for improvement has been made in respect of the charging member. Specifically as a measure for improving charging uniformity studies are made on how to make the resistance distribution of the charging member uniform and improve the surface properties of the charging member.

As to the former measures are available in which e.g. the dispersion of a conductive material in a surface layer outermost layer of the charging member is improved a resin having a relatively low volume resistivity is used in a binding material of a surface layer of the contact charging member and the layer thickness of each layer constituting the contact charging member is adjusted to be uniform.

As to the latter measures are available in which e.g. a leveling agent is added to a surface layer of the charging member and an elastic layer of the charging member is improved in surface properties.

In the case where only a direct current voltage is applied to the charging member to charge the electrophotographic photosensitive member Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. H05 341620 proposes a technique in which the surface roughness of the charging member is made to be 5 m or less to achieve the charging uniformity.

Japanese Patent Application Laid open No. H08 286468 proposes a technique in which that the ten point average roughness Rz jis JIS B 0601 of the charging member surface is made to be 20 m or less in order for the charging uniformity to be secured to provide good images.

According to the above proposals the improvement of initial stage charging uniformity can be substantially achieved but under existing circumstances is insufficient in respect of stabilizing the charging uniformity. More specifically as a result of long term service contaminant such as developer dust or paper dust adheres to the surface of the charging member. In that case where they come to adhere partially non uniformly or adhere in a large quantity they may lower the charging uniformity.

For the subject of stabilizing the charging uniformity during long term service proposals are made in which the surface roughness is further adjusted to make improvement. For example in Japanese Patent Applications Laid open No. 2004 061640 and No. 2004 309911 a technique is disclosed in which the surface roughness of the charging member is controlled to secure the charging uniformity. Also in Japanese Patent Applications Laid open No. 2004 038056 a technique is disclosed in which the surface roughness of the charging member and the coefficient of surface friction of the electrophotographic photosensitive member are controlled to secure the charging uniformity.

In general it is known that contaminant can be better kept from adhering to the surface of the charging member as a result of long term service as the charging member has a smaller surface roughness. Also if it has too large surface roughness faulty images such as spots may come about because of faulty charging due to the surface shape of the charging member. From these viewpoints it is more preferable for the charging member to have a smaller surface roughness.

Electrophotographic apparatus are more highly demanded to achieve higher speed and higher image quality. In particular as images have come to be reproduced in colors in full color halftone images and solid images have come to be often reproduced and such a demand for higher image quality increases steadily year by year.

For example importance is attached to the uniformity of density and tint in reproduced images on each sheet and the stability in continuous image reproduction and tolerance therefore have become remarkably severer as compared with that in black and white printers and black and white copying machines. In particular in electrophotographic apparatus employing the DC contact charging system records in one cycle of electrophotographic processing tends to appear as charge potential non uniformity of the electrophotographic photosensitive member which may cause ghost due to records of exposure image exposure and charge memory due to transfer transfer memory . Then as a result density non uniformity may come about in reproduced images.

Accordingly in usual cases a measure is applied in which a charge elimination de charging means such as a pre exposure means is provided on the downstream side of a transfer means and on the upstream side of a charging means so as to eliminate records in one cycle of electrophotographic processing and eliminate the non uniformity of surface potential of the electrophotographic photosensitive member.

However as a result of studies made by the present inventors it has turned out that the charging lines tend to greatly occur when the electrophotographic photosensitive member employing the type iii constitution between the support and the photosensitive layer is used in an electrophotographic apparatus having such a pre exposure means. In addition it has turned out that the charging lines occur more conspicuously in a low temperature and low humidity environment and also in the case where cycle time is short.

An object of the present invention is to provide an electrophotographic photosensitive member in which it is difficult for the charging lines to occur even when employing the type iii constitution between the support and the photosensitive layer.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have such an electrophotographic photosensitive member.

Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing such an electrophotographic photosensitive member.

The present invention is an electrophotographic photosensitive member having a support a conductive layer formed on the support an intermediate layer formed on the conductive layer and a photosensitive layer formed on the intermediate layer wherein 

The conductive layer is a layer formed by using a conductive layer coating fluid which contains TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving an average particle diameter of from 0.20 m or more to 0.60 m or less and

The present invention is also a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus which have the above electrophotographic photosensitive member.

The present invention is still also a process for producing an electrophotographic photosensitive member the process having a conductive layer forming step of forming on a support a conductive layer having a volume resistivity of from more than 8.0 10 cm to 1.0 10 cm or less an intermediate layer forming step of forming an intermediate layer on the conductive layer and a photosensitive layer forming step of forming a photosensitive layer on the intermediate layer 

In the conductive layer forming step the layer being formed by using a conductive layer coating fluid which contains TiO particles coated with oxygen deficient SnO coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving an average particle diameter of from 0.20 m or more to 0.60 m or less.

According to the present invention an electrophotographic photosensitive member can be provided in which the charging lines are difficult to cause even when employing the type iii constitution between the support and the photosensitive layer.

According to the present invention a process cartridge and an electrophotographic apparatus also can be provided having the electrophotographic photosensitive member in which it is difficult to cause the charging lines.

The electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention has a support a conductive layer formed on the support an intermediate layer formed on the conductive layer and a photosensitive layer formed on the intermediate layer.

In the present invention particles including TiOparticles coated with SnOwhose resistivity has been reduced by effecting oxygen deficiency are used as a conductive material to be incorporated in the conductive layer. In the present invention such particles are referred to as TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO . As a result of decreasing the resistivity in this way the particles have been made to have a resistivity reduced to about 1 10 000 in terms of powder resistivity.

The oxygen deficient SnOhas reuse properties superior to SnOdoped with a different element such as antimony. In addition with the oxygen deficient SnO increase in resistivity in a low humidity environment and decrease in resistivity in a high humidity environment are less and hence it is superior in environmental stability.

The conductive material for the conductive layer used in the present invention is also not particles consisting of only the oxygen deficient SnO oxygen deficient SnOparticles but the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO. The reason therefor is as follows 

First the use of core particles TiOparticles is to improve the dispersibility of particles in a conductive layer coating fluid. If a conductive layer coating fluid is prepared using the oxygen deficient SnO the oxygen deficient SnOtend to become agglomerated especially when the oxygen deficient SnOis contained in a high percentage.

Then TiOparticles are used as the core particles for the reason that the affinity between the oxygen deficient moiety of the oxygen deficient SnOand the oxide moiety at the TiOparticle surfaces strengthens the bonding between oxygen deficient SnOcoat layers and the core material. The oxygen deficient SnO unlike doped SnO may be oxidized in the presence of oxygen to lose oxygen deficient moieties resulting in low conductivity high powder resistivity . However using the TiOparticles as the core particles protects the oxygen deficient moieties of the oxygen deficient SnOis protected.

Where exposure light image exposure light is laser light the core particles TiOparticles can also keep interference fringes from appearing on reproduced images because of interference of light reflecting from the support surface at the time of laser exposure.

In addition a method for producing the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO a method for preparing the oxygen deficient SnOand a method for coating the TiOparticles with the oxygen deficient SnO are disclosed in Japanese Patent Applications Laid open Nos. H07 295245 and H04 154621.

In order to keep the charging lines from occurring the conductive layer is required to have a volume resistivity of from more than 8.0 10 cm to 1.0 10 cm or less. The conductive layer may preferably have a low resistivity. However in order to keep the charging lines from occurring in a low temperature and low humidity environment the conductive layer is required to have a volume resistivity of 1.0 10 cm or less. On the other hand if the conductive layer has too low resistivity spots and fog may occur because of the injection of electric charges into the photosensitive layer in a high temperature and high humidity environment and hence the conductive layer may preferably have a volume resistivity of more than 8.0 10 cm.

In the present invention the volume resistivity of the conductive layer is measured in the following way.

First using the conductive layer coating fluid a conductive layer sample layer thickness about 10 to 15 m the layer thickness may preferably be the same as that of the conductive layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is formed on an aluminum sheet. On this conductive layer sample a thin film of gold is formed by vacuum deposition. The value of electric current flowing across the two electrodes of the aluminum sheet and the thin film of gold is measured with a picoammeter pA meter . The measurement is performed in an environment of 23 C. 60 RH. A voltage of 0.1 V is applied. One minute after the start of the measurement of the value of electric current a value having become stable is read and the volume resistivity of the conductive layer is derived therefrom.

In order to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range it is preferable to use TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving powder resistivity in the range of from 1 to 500 cm and more preferably in the range of from 1 to 250 cm. A conductive layer coating fluid prepared using TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving too high powder resistivity makes it difficult to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range. On the other hand a conductive layer coating fluid prepared using TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving too low powder resistivity may produce an electrophotographic photosensitive member having low chargeability.

In order to stably obtain the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving volume resistivity within the above range the mixing proportion of raw materials may be controlled when the particles are produced. For example a tin raw material necessary for producing SnOin an amount of from 30 to 60 mass based on the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOmay be mixed when the particles are produced as calculated assuming that the purity of SnOobtained from the tin raw material is 100 . In other words it is preferable that the coverage of the oxygen deficient SnOon the TiOparticles is from 30 to 60 mass .

A resistance measuring instrument LORESTA AP manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation is used as a measuring instrument. A measurement object powder i.e. particles is compacted at a pressure of 500 kg cmto prepare a pellet shaped measuring sample. The measurement is performed in an environment of 23 C. 60 RH. A voltage of 100 V is applied.

In order to keep the charging lines from occurring the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare also required to have an average particle diameter of from 0.20 m or more to 0.60 m or less in the conductive layer coating fluid. In the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOcontained in the conductive layer coating fluid TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOof from 0.10 m or more to 0.40 m or less in particle diameter may preferably be in a proportion of 45 by number or more and more preferably 60 by number or more based on the number of all the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOcontained in the conductive layer coating fluid.

In the present invention the particle diameter inclusive of average particle diameter and particle size distribution of the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOin the conductive layer coating fluid is measured by a liquid phase sedimentation method in the following way.

First the conductive layer coating fluid is diluted with the same solvent included therein to have a transmittance of 0.8 or more and 1.0 or less. Next a histogram of average particle diameter volume base D50 and particle size distribution is made out by measurement using an ultra centrifugal automatic particle size distribution measuring instrument CAPA 700 manufactured by Horiba Ltd. at the number of revolutions of 3 000 rpm.

Even where the conductive layer has the same composition the powder resistivity decreases as the average particle diameter of the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOincreases and at the same time the volume resistivity also decreases.

If the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhave an average particle diameter of less than 0.20 m the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOmust be used in a large quantity in order to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range. However if the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare used in a large quantity it is difficult to achieve the conductive layer surface roughness Rz jis 1 to 3 m that is preferable in order to keep interference fringes from appearing on reproduced images because of interference of light reflecting from the surface of the conductive layer. In addition Rz jis corresponds to what has ever been defined as Rz in JIS B 0601 1994 . The JIS B 0601 standard has been revised in 2001 and the Rz has been revised and replaced by Ry maximum height used in 1994. The Rz in 1994 has been changed in 2001 for the purpose of distinction and named Rz jis.

If the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare used in a large quantity the conductive layer tends to come cracked when it has a large layer thickness to have low film properties.

On the other hand where the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhave an average particle diameter of more than 0.60 m or even though not more than that where the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOof from 0.10 m or more to 0.40 m or less in particle diameter are in a proportion of less than 45 by number it is possible to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range. However the surface of the conductive layer may become extremely rough to tend to cause local injection of electric charges into the photosensitive layer and in some case spots appear conspicuously on the white background in reproduced images.

In the present invention the conductive layer may be formed by coating the support with a conductive layer coating fluid obtained by dispersing in a binding material together with a solvent the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOhaving an average particle diameter of from 0.20 m or more to 0.60 m or less and then drying the wet coating formed. For dispersing the particles a method is available which makes use of a paint shaker a sand mill a ball mill a liquid impact type high speed dispersion machine or the like.

The solvent used for the conductive layer coating fluid may be exemplified by the following Alcohols such as methanol ethanol and isopropanol ketones such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers such as tetrahydrofuran dioxane ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and propylene glycol monomethyl ether esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene.

From the viewpoint of the covering of surface defects of the support the conductive layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 10 m or more to 25 m or less and more preferably from 15 m or more to 20 m or less.

In addition in the present invention the layer thickness of each layer inclusive of the conductive layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member is measured with FISCHERSCOPE Multi Measurement System mms available from Fisher Instruments Co.

The binding material of the conductive layer may include resins binder resins such as phenol resin polyurethane polyamide polyimide polyamide imide polyvinyl acetal epoxy resin acrylic resin melamine resin and polyester. One or two or more of these may be used. Also among various resins the binder resin of the conductive layer may preferably be a hardening resin and more preferably a thermosetting resin from the viewpoint of the prevention of migration to other layer s the adhesiveness to the support the dispersibility and dispersion stability of the conductive material the solvent resistance after film formation and so forth. Specifically thermosetting phenol resin and polyurethane are preferred. In the case where the hardening resin is used as the binder resin of the conductive layer the binding material to be contained in the conductive layer coating fluid includes a monomer and or an oligomer of the hardening resin.

It is also preferable that in the conductive layer coating fluid the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO P and the binding material B are in a mass ratio P B ranging from 2.3 1.0 to 3.3 1.0. If the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare in too small proportion it is difficult to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range. If the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOare in too large proportion it is difficult for the TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnOto bind in the conductive layer tending to cause cracking.

In order to keep interference fringes from appearing on reproduced images because of interference of light reflecting from the surface of the conductive layer a surface roughness providing material for roughening the surface of the conductive layer may be added to the conductive layer coating fluid. Such a surface roughness providing material may preferably be resin particles having an average particle diameter of from 1 m or more to 3 m or less. For example such particles may include particles of hardening rubbers and of hardening resins such as polyurethane epoxy resin alkyd resin phenol resin polyester silicone resin and acryl melamine resin. In particular particles of silicone resin are preferred as being less agglomerative. The specific gravity of resin particles which is 0.5 to 2 is smaller than the specific gravity of TiOparticles coated with oxygen deficient SnO which is 4 to 7 and hence the surface of the conductive layer can efficiently be roughened at the time of formation of the conductive layer. However the conductive layer has a tendency to increase volume resistivity as the content of the surface roughness providing material in the conductive layer increases. Hence in order to hold the volume resistivity of the conductive layer within the above range the content of the surface roughness providing material in the conductive layer may preferably be so controlled as to be from 15 to 25 mass based on the binder resin in the conductive layer.

A leveling agent may be added in order to enhance the surface properties of the conductive layer and pigment particles may be incorporated in the conductive layer in order to improve the covering properties of the conductive layer.

In order to block the injection of electric charges from the conductive layer into the photosensitive layer it is necessary that an intermediate layer having electrical barrier properties is provided between the conductive layer and the photosensitive layer. Such an intermediate layer may preferably have a volume resistivity of from 1.0 10 cm or more to 1.0 10 cm or less. If the intermediate layer has too low volume resistivity it may have poor electrical barrier properties to tend to seriously cause spots and fog due to the injection of electric charges from the conductive layer. If on the other hand the intermediate layer has too high volume resistivity the flow of electric charges carriers may stagnate at the time of image formation to tend to result in a serious rise in residual potential.

The volume resistivity of the intermediate layer in the present invention is measured in the following way.

First using an intermediate layer coating fluid an intermediate layer sample layer thickness about 2 to 5 m is formed on an aluminum sheet. On this intermediate layer sample a thin film of gold is formed by vacuum deposition. The value of electric current flowing across the two electrodes of the aluminum sheet and the thin film of gold is measured with a picoammeter pA meter . The measurement is measured in an environment of 23 C. 60 RH. A voltage of 100 V is applied. One minute after the start of the measurement of the value of electric current a value having become stable is read and the volume resistivity of the intermediate layer is derived therefrom.

The intermediate layer may be formed by coating the conductive layer with an intermediate layer coating fluid containing a binder resin and drying the wet coating formed.

The binder resin for the intermediate layer may be exemplified by the following Water soluble resins such as polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl methyl ether polyacrylic acids methyl cellulose ethyl cellulose polyglutamic acid casein and starch and polyamide polyimide polyamide imide polyamic acid melamine resin epoxy resin polyurethane and polyglutamates.

In order to effectively bring out the electrical barrier properties and from the viewpoint of coatability adhesiveness solvent resistance and electrical resistance the binder resin for the intermediate layer may preferably be a thermoplastic resin. Specifically a thermoplastic polyamide is preferred. As the polyamide a low crystallizable or non crystallizable copolymer nylon or the like is preferred as being able to be coated in the state of solution. Also the intermediate layer may preferably have a layer thickness of from 0.1 m or more to 2 m or less.

In a multi layer sample prepared by using the conductive layer coating fluid and the intermediate layer coating fluid and by superposing the conductive layer sample and the intermediate layer sample in this order it is preferred to satisfy the relationship of 0.2 Imin I 0 1.0 where under the application of a voltage of 0.10 V m to the multi layer sample total thickness the layer thickness of the conductive layer sample the layer thickness of the intermediate layer sample the value of electric current at voltage application time t second is represented by I t and the minimum value of electric current I t in the range of 0 t 300 is represented by Imin.

A method for measuring the value of electric current with respect to the voltage application time and a method for determining the value of Imin I 0 are described below.

In the multi layer sample the layer thickness of the conductive layer sample and the layer thickness of the intermediate layer sample may preferably be equal respectively to the layer thickness of the conductive layer and the layer thickness of the intermediate layer of the electrophotographic photosensitive member. Specifically the conductive layer sample is formed on an aluminum sheet in a layer thickness of from 10 to 15 m and the intermediate layer is formed thereon in a layer thickness of from 0.5 to 1.5 m.

First a thin film of gold is formed on the intermediate layer sample by vacuum deposition and a voltage of 0.10 V m is applied to the multi layer sample total thickness through the two electrodes of the aluminum sheet and the thin film of gold from a constant voltage power source. Next the value of electric current flowing across the two electrodes of the aluminum sheet and thin film of gold is measured with a picoammeter pA meter . The measurement is performed in an environment of 23 C. 60 RH. A voltage of 100 V is applied. The value of electric current is measured until 300 seconds has passed regarding the voltage application starting time as 0 second. Further the minimum value of electric current measured during 0 second to 300 seconds is represented by Imin where the value of I 0 is found by extrapolation from values present in the range of 5 seconds or less obtaining the value of Imin I 0 .

The value of Imin I 0 is considered to be influenced by the movement of electric charges at the interface between the conductive layer and the intermediate layer. It is considered that as the value of Imin I 0 is smaller the movement of electric charges at the interface between the conductive layer and the intermediate layer is not smoother showing that the electric charges stand easily come stagnant at the interface between the conductive layer and the intermediate layer. In order to keep the charging lines from occurring the value of Imin I 0 may preferably be 0.2 or more. The closer to 1.0 the more effective in order to keep the charging lines from occurring.

An electron transport material an electron accepting material such as an acceptor may be incorporated in the intermediate layer in order for the flow of electric charges carriers not to stagnate in the intermediate layer.

The constitution of the electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention is described below.

As shown in B C and D the electrophotographic photosensitive member of the present invention is an electrophotographic photosensitive member having on a support a conductive layer an intermediate layer a photosensitive layer a charge generation layer a charge transport layer in this order.

The photosensitive layer may be either of a single layer type photosensitive layer which contains a charge transporting material and a charge generating material in the same layer see and a multi layer type function separated type photosensitive layer which is separated into a charge generation layer containing a charge generating material and a charge transport layer containing a charge transporting material. From the viewpoint of electrophotographic performance the multi layer type photosensitive layer is preferred. The multi layer type photosensitive layer may also include a regular layer type photosensitive layer in which the charge generation layer and the charge transport layer are superposed in this order from the support side see and a reverse layer type photosensitive layer in which the charge transport layer and the charge generation layer are superposed in this order from the support side see . From the viewpoint of electrophotographic performance the regular layer type photosensitive layer is preferred.

A protective layer may also be provided on the photosensitive layer the charge generation layer or the charge transport layer see .

As the support it may be one having conductivity conductive support . For example supports made of a metal such as aluminum aluminum alloy or stainless steel are usable.

The charging member used preferably in the present invention is a member having the shape of a roller hereinafter also charging roller . It may be constituted of e.g. a conductive substrate and one or two or more cover layers formed on the conductive substrate. At least one of the cover layers is provided with conductivity. Stated more specifically it may be constituted of a conductive substrate a conductive elastic layer formed on the conductive substrate and a surface layer formed on the conductive elastic layer.

The surface of the charging member may preferably have a ten point average roughness Rz jis of 5.0 m or less.

The ten point average roughness Rz jis of the surface of the charging member is measured with a surface profile analyzer SE 3400 manufactured by Kosaka Laboratory Ltd. More specifically Rz jis is measured with this measuring instrument at any six points on the surface of the charging member and an average value of measurement values at the six points is regarded as the ten point average roughness.

If the charging member has too large surface roughness a developer toner and its external additives tends to adhere to the surface of the charging member as a result of continuous image reproduction resulting in contamination of the charging member surface appearing on the images reproduced.

By controlling the surface of the charging member to have the roughness within the specific range it is possible to keep small the difference in quantity of electric charges in discharge due to difference in level of unevenness of the surface. Thus faulty images such as spots can be kept from occurring because of faulty charging ascribable to the surface profile of the charging member.

In reference numeral denotes a drum shaped electrophotographic photosensitive member which is rotatively driven around an axis in the direction of an arrow at a given peripheral speed.

The peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member rotatively driven is uniformly charged to a positive or negative given potential through a charging means . The electrophotographic photosensitive member thus charged is then exposed to exposure light image exposure light emitted from an exposure means not shown for slit exposure laser beam scanning exposure or the like. In this way electrostatic latent images corresponding to the intended image are successively formed on the peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member . Voltage to be applied to the charging means may be only direct current voltage or may be direct current voltage on which alternating current voltage is superimposed.

The electrostatic latent images thus formed on the peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member are developed with a toner of a developing means to form toner images. Then the toner images thus formed and held on the peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member are successively transferred onto a transfer material such as paper P by applying a transfer bias from a transfer means a transfer roller . In addition the transfer material is fed through a transfer material feed means not shown to the part contact zone between the electrophotographic photosensitive member and the transfer means in such a manner as synchronized with the rotation of the electrophotographic photosensitive member .

The transfer material P to which the toner images have been transferred is separated from the peripheral surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member and is led into a fixing means where the toner images are fixed and is then put out of the apparatus as an image formed material a print or copy .

The surface of the electrophotographic photosensitive member from which toner images have been transferred is subjected to removal of the developer toner remaining after the transfer through a cleaning means such as a cleaning blade and thus is cleaned. It is further subjected to charge elimination by pre exposure light emitted from a pre exposure means not shown and thereafter repeatedly used for image formation.

The apparatus may be constituted of a combination of plural components integrally held in a container as a process cartridge from among the constituents such as the above electrophotographic photosensitive member charging means developing means transfer means and cleaning means so that the process cartridge is set detachably mountable to the main body of an electrophotographic apparatus. In the electrophotographic photosensitive member and the charging means developing means and cleaning means are integrally held to form a process cartridge detachably mountable to the main body of the electrophotographic apparatus through a guide means such as rails installed in the main body of the electrophotographic apparatus.

Evaluation was made on images which were reproduced at the initial stage and after 5 000 sheets of paper were run. Details are as follows 

LBP 2510 was so modified as to be operated at a process speed of 190 mm s. Evaluation was made using this modified machine in which each electrophotographic photosensitive member and each charging roller were set in a cyan color process cartridge of LBP 2510 and this process cartridge was set in a cyan process cartridge station.

During the paper feed running full color printing was carried out in an intermittent mode in which a character image with a print percentage of 2 was reproduced on one sheet at intervals of 20 seconds using letter paper to reproduce images on 5 000 sheets.

Then samples for image evaluation were reproduced on three sheets having respectively a solid white image a solid black image and a one dot zigzag pattern halftone image at the start of running and after 5 000 sheets of paper were run.
