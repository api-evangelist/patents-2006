The present invention relates to computer systems. More particularly the present invention relates to a system and method for provisioning target computer system s with programs such as an operating system program and application program s in accordance with a selected policy and based on a stored user state.

A user state on a computer system is a collection of data such as user state settings related to programs such as operating system programs and application programs on the computer system. Conventionally a stored user state also termed a user state package is created by obtaining selected user state data from registries and files on the computer system and storing the collected user state data as a stored user state package. User states packages are typically created for example by a system administrator for installation to another computer system or for backup purposes.

When a policy such as an organizational policy stipulates selected policy compliant programs and or program versions for installation on computer systems prior to restoring a user state package to a computer system a system administrator must first provision the computer system to which the user state package will be restored with an operating system image and applications in accordance with the organizational policy. Conventionally this procedure is manually performed by the system administrator and is often a time consuming process for the system administrator to select and obtain policy compliant programs and determine and obtain program version updates.

In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention a computer implemented method includes receiving a selection of a user state package to apply to a target the user state package including at least one or more user state settings. A selection of a policy to apply to the target is received the policy identifying one or more policy compliant programs. A selection of a target is received the target identifying at least one or more computer systems. One or more user state package programs are automatically determined based on at least one or more of the user state settings and the one or more policy compliant programs are automatically determined from the policy. One or more target programs are selected for application to the target from a group consisting of the one or more user state package programs and the one or more policy compliant programs. In one embodiment the target programs are automatically deployed to and installed on the target and the user state settings are restored to the target.

In accordance with another embodiment a user input confirming the selection of a program including program versions not identified as a user state package program is obtained prior to selecting the program as a target program.

Embodiments in accordance with the invention permit a user such as a system administrator to assign a user state package and policy to a target and to have target programs such as an operating system program and application programs automatically deployed and installed on the target in accordance with the selected policy and based on the user state package. Embodiments in accordance with the invention further automatically restore the user state settings to the target as applicable. In some embodiments the user state settings are automatically transformed as needed for use by a target program.

Embodiments are best understood by reference to the following detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Common reference numerals are used throughout the drawings and detailed description to indicate like elements.

In accordance with one embodiment referring generally to the selection of a stored user state package such as by a system administrator is received operation for application to a target. The selection of the target such as by the system administrator is received operation . The selection of a policy such as by the system administrator is received operation for application to the target. User state package programs such as operating system programs and application programs for which settings are present in the user state package are determined operation . Policy compliant programs such as operating system programs and application programs which are identified in the selected policy are determined operation .

Referring generally now to each user state package program is automatically selected operation for evaluation with the selected policy and a determination is made whether each user state package program corresponds to a policy compliant program check operation . When a selected user state package program does not correspond to a policy compliant program NO the user state package program is automatically not selected as a target program. Alternatively when a selected user state package program corresponds to a policy compliant program YES a determination is made whether the version of the user state package program if any corresponds to a version of a corresponding policy compliant program check operation .

When the version of the user state package program corresponds to a version of a corresponding policy compliant program YES the user state package program and version is automatically selected as a target program operation . Otherwise when a selected user state package program is a policy compliant program but the version does not correspond to a version of a corresponding policy compliant program NO the policy compliant program and version is automatically selected as a target program operation . Each user state package program is incremented through check operation until each user state package program is evaluated in accordance with the selected policy.

Referring generally now to the selected policy is automatically evaluated to determine whether there are policy compliant programs to be selected as target programs for example required policy compliant programs which are not currently selected as target programs check operation . When there are policy compliant programs to be selected as target programs YES those policy compliant programs i.e. those identified in check operation are automatically selected as target programs operation . Otherwise when there are no policy compliant programs to be selected as target programs NO the target programs are automatically deployed to the target operation and automatically installed on the target operation .

The user state package e.g. the user state settings in the user state package are automatically restored to the target operation . In some embodiments during restoration the user state settings are transformed as applicable for use by corresponding target programs installed on the target. In some embodiments optionally a target configuration package is generated identifying each of the target programs and user state settings installed on the target operation .

In some embodiments optionally a notification is generated operation for example providing a list of the target programs and providing an installation status.

In accordance with another embodiment referring generally now to B and C a method is also described which prompts user input to confirm or deny the selection of a policy compliant program version as a target program e.g. a version update operations and and to confirm or deny the selection of a policy compliant program e.g. a required policy compliant program not earlier selected as a target program operations and . In one embodiment denial of the selection of the policy compliant program version and or policy compliant program as a target program by the user is logged operations and respectively such as for later notification and or analysis.

In one embodiment deployment application is loaded onto host computer system via an I O device such as from a CD DVD or floppy disk containing deployment application . In one embodiment deployment application is stored for example in memory of host computer system and executed on host computer system .

In one embodiment host computer system includes one or more stored policy ies one or more stored user state package s and one or more deployable program s . In one embodiment deployable program s are suitable for deployment and installation to a target and can include complete programs such as an operating system program and one or more application programs as well as program updates such as program version updates.

In one embodiment user state package s policy ies and deployable program s are stored on host computer system such as in memory however in other embodiments some or all of user state package s policy ies and deployable program s are stored on host computer system and or one or more other computer systems not shown accessible by host computer system .

In one embodiment a stored user state package such as a user state package is a collection of data such as user state settings related to programs such as operating system programs and application programs on a computer system. For example in the present embodiment user state package is a collection of data including user state settings obtained from a user computer system related to a user operating system and one or more user application s on user computer system .

As earlier described typically a stored user state package is created by collecting user state settings e.g. user state settings from registries and files on a computer system e.g. user computer system and storing the collected data as a user state package e.g. as user state package . Herein user state settings can include both default settings associated with a program as well as user defined settings if any set by a user for an associated program. Examples of user state settings include but are not limited to font type document margins line spacing and automatic formatting.

In some embodiments a user state package e.g. user state package includes a record of the program name including program version if any of each program for which user state settings are stored on the user computer system e.g. user computer system . Stored user state packages and user state settings as well as the generation of a user state package are well known to those of skill in the art and are not further described herein to avoid detracting from the description of the invention. Herein the unmodified terms program and programs includes operating system programs and or application programs unless otherwise specified.

In one embodiment host computer system is a server computer system. Host computer system is coupled to user computer system i.e. a second computer system of computer system by a network . User computer system sometimes referred to as a client computer system typically includes a central processing unit CPU sometimes called a processor an input output I O interface and a memory . User computer system can further include standard devices such as a keyboard a mouse a display device and a printer as well as one or more standard input output I O device s such as a compact disk CD or DVD drive floppy disk drive or other digital or waveform ports for inputting data to and outputting data from user computer system . In various embodiments I O interface includes analog modems digital modems and or one or more network interface card s .

In one embodiment user computer system includes user operating system i.e. an operating system program and one or more user application s i.e. one or more application programs. In one embodiment user state settings are stored on user computer system for example in various structures of memory such as in files and registries of user computer system . The location and storage of user settings on a user computer system are well known to those of skill in the art and not further described herein to avoid detracting from the principles of the invention.

Additional computer systems such as computer systems A N one or more third computer systems are also coupled to host computer system by network . In one embodiment computer systems A N are similar to user computer system and for example include a central processing unit an input output I O interface and a memory. Computer systems A N may further include standard devices like a keyboard a mouse a printer and a display device. In one embodiment one or more of computer systems A N are designated as a target to receive selected target programs e.g. target programs and user state package settings if applicable e.g. restored user state package setting based on a selected user state package and in accordance with a selected policy as further herein described.

Herein network can be any network or network system that is of interest to a user including a local network or the Internet. Further the particular type of and configuration of host computer system user computer system and computer systems A N are not essential to this embodiment of the invention.

In RECEIVE SELECTION OF USER STATE PACKAGE operation in one embodiment the selection of a user state package is received. In one embodiment a user such as a system administrator selects a stored user state package to apply to a target and the selection is communicated to deployment application .

Herein in one embodiment a user state package i.e. user state package can represent a single user or a group of users a single computer system or a group of computer systems. In one embodiment user state package includes at least user state settings e.g. user state settings for operating systems and applications e.g. user operating system and user application s on a computer system e.g. user computer system . In some embodiments user state package can further include a record of each program including program version if any for which user state settings are stored.

In one embodiment one or more user state packages are displayed such as on display device and a user such as a system administrator selects a user state package for application to a target. For example in one embodiment one or more user state package icons representing different user state packages e.g. user state package are displayed on display device . The system administrator positions a cursor such as via mouse over a desired user state package icon and clicks on the user state package icon to select an associated user state package .

As another example in one embodiment the system administrator positions a cursor such as via mouse over a desired user state package icon and drags the user state package icon to a designated user state package selection area displayed on display device to select an associated user state package . From RECEIVE SELECTION OF USER STATE PACKAGE operation processing transitions to a RECEIVE SELECTION OF TARGET operation .

In RECEIVE SELECTION OF TARGET operation in one embodiment the selection of a target is received. In one embodiment a user such as the system administrator selects one or more targets and the selection is communicated to deployment application .

Herein in one embodiment a target can represent a single user or a group of users a single computer system or a group of computer systems. A target can represent the users or computer systems in an organization domain or group.

In one embodiment one or more targets are displayed such as on display device and the system administrator selects one or more targets. For example in one embodiment one or more target icons representing different targets such as target icons representing one or more computer systems A N are displayed on display device . The system administrator positions a cursor over a desired target icon such as via mouse and clicks on the target icon to select an associated target e.g. computer system A.

As another example in one embodiment the system administrator positions a cursor over a desired target icon such as via mouse and drags the target icon to a designated target selection area displayed on display device to select an associated target such as for example computer system A. From RECEIVE SELECTION OF TARGET operation processing transitions to a RECEIVE SELECTION OF POLICY operation .

In RECEIVE SELECTION OF POLICY operation in one embodiment the selection of a policy is received. In one embodiment a user such as the system administrator selects a policy to apply to a target and the selection is communicated to deployment application .

Herein in one embodiment a policy can represent an organizational policy a domain policy a group policy a user policy or a machine policy. In one embodiment a policy includes at least a record of programs determined to be compliant with the policy herein termed policy compliant programs including the policy compliant program version if any. In some embodiments the policy e.g. policy further specifies policy compliant settings for one or more of the policy compliant programs.

In one embodiment one or more policies are displayed such as on display device and the system administrator selects one or more policies. For example in one embodiment one or more policy icons representing one or more policies are displayed on display device . The system administrator positions a cursor over a policy icon such as via mouse and clicks on the selected policy icons to select one or more associated policies .

As another example in one embodiment the system administrator positions a cursor over a desired policy icon such as via mouse and drags the policy icon to a designated policy selection area displayed on display device to select an associated policy such as for example a policy . From RECEIVE SELECTION OF POLICY operation processing transitions to a DETERMINE USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM S operation .

In DETERMINE USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM S operation programs for which user state settings are present in the selected user state package herein termed user state package programs are automatically determined. In one embodiment the user state package program s are automatically determined from information present in the user state package e.g. user state package . Determination of programs from user state settings is well known to those of skill in the art and not further described herein to avoid detracting from the principles of the invention.

In one embodiment the user state package program s are automatically determined based on the user state settings e.g. user state setting present in the user state package e.g. user state package . In one embodiment each user state package program determined from the user state package identifies a particular user state package program including user state package program version if any.

For example assume user state package includes user state settings such as user state settings and deployment application automatically determines the user state package programs as 

From DETERMINE USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM S operation processing transitions to a DETERMINE POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S operation .

In DETERMINE POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S operation programs identified in the selected policy herein termed policy compliant programs are automatically determined. In one embodiment the policy compliant program s are automatically determined from information present in the policy e.g. policy . In one embodiment a policy includes at least a record of policy compliant programs including the policy compliant program version if any. For example assume policy specifies policy compliant programs and deployment application automatically determines the policy compliant programs as 

From DETERMINE POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S operation processing transitions to a SELECT USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM operation .

Referring now to in SELECT USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM operation in one embodiment an initial user state package program determined in operation is automatically selected for comparison to policy compliant programs determined in operation . For example assume the user state package program Microsoft Windows XP is initially selected for comparison to policy compliant programs identified in policy . From SELECT USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM operation processing transitions to a POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM check operation .

In POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM check operation in one embodiment the user state package program selected in operation is automatically compared to policy compliant programs determined in operation . In one embodiment the user state package program is automatically compared to each policy compliant program in policy to determine if the user state package program corresponds to one or more policy compliant programs.

In an alternative embodiment the comparison is limited to comparisons between similar program types. For example in one embodiment a user state package program that is an operating system program is compared with policy compliant programs that are operating system programs. Similarly a user state package program that is a word processing program is compared with policy compliant programs that are word processing programs.

In one embodiment if the user state package program corresponds to one or more policy compliant programs the user state package program is automatically determined to correspond to a program compliant program. Alternatively if the user state package program does not correspond to one or more policy compliant programs the user state package program is automatically determined not to correspond to a program compliant program.

For example assume the user state package program Microsoft Windows XP is initially selected in operation and compared to the policy compliant program Microsoft Window XP Microsoft Word 2000 and Microsoft Word 2007. The user state package program Microsoft Windows XP corresponds to the policy compliant program Microsoft Windows XP without regard to version. In particular the user state package program e.g. Microsoft Windows and the policy compliant program e.g. Microsoft Windows correspond without consideration of the version in this operation. Alternatively if for example Microsoft Windows any version had not been identified as a policy compliant program the user state package program Microsoft Windows XP would not correspond to one or more policy compliant programs.

In one embodiment if the user state package program is determined to correspond to one or more policy compliant programs YES processing transitions from POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM check operation to a POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION check operation . Otherwise if the user state package program is determined not to correspond to one or more policy compliant programs NO processing transitions from POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM check operation to a NEXT check operation further described herein.

In POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION check operation in one embodiment a determination is made whether the user state package program version corresponds to a policy compliant program version. In one embodiment the user state package program version is compared to the policy compliant program versions for each of the policy compliant programs corresponded to in check operation .

For example the user state package program Microsoft Windows version XP of is compared to each policy compliant program version for each policy compliant program corresponded to in check operation . In the present example the user state package program version XP of Microsoft Windows corresponds to the policy compliant program version XP of Microsoft Windows. In the alternative if for example the user state package program version did not match a policy compliant program version for example if only version 2000 of Microsoft Windows had been specified as a policy compliant program version in policy the user state package program version would not correspond to a policy compliant program version.

In one embodiment if the user state package program version does not correspond to a policy compliant program version NO processing transitions from POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION check operation to a SELECT POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION AS TARGET PROGRAM operation further described herein. Alternatively if the user state package program version corresponds to a policy compliant program version YES processing transitions from POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION check operation to a SELECT USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM VERSION AS TARGET PROGRAM operation .

In SELECT USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM VERSION AS TARGET PROGRAM operation in one embodiment the user state package program version is automatically selected as a target program. In one embodiment the user state package program version is logged as a target program to a memory structure of deployment application such as a target program list that includes an entry for each target program. Herein a target program is a program including version if any selected as a target program in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. From SELECT USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM VERSION AS TARGET PROGRAM operation processing transitions to NEXT check operation .

In NEXT check operation a determination is made whether a next user state package program is to be evaluated. If a next user state package program is to be evaluated from NEXT check operation processing returns to SELECT USER STATE PACKAGE PROGRAM operation with a next user state package program being selected. Otherwise if a next user state package program is not to be evaluated from NEXT check operation processing transitions to an OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S TO INSTALL check operation further described herein.

In the present example the user state package program Microsoft Word 97 remains to be next evaluated. Continuing the present example Microsoft Word Version 97 is next selected in operation . In check operation Microsoft Word Version 97 is compared to the policy compliant programs Microsoft Window XP Microsoft Word 2000 and Microsoft Word 2007. The user state package program Microsoft Word 97 corresponds to the policy compliant programs Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Word 2000 regardless of version i.e. Microsoft Word. However in check operation Microsoft Word version 97 does not correspond to either the policy compliant programs Microsoft Word version 2007 or 2000. Thus processing transitions from check operation to SELECT POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION AS TARGET PROGRAM operation .

In SELECT POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION AS TARGET PROGRAM operation the policy compliant program version corresponded to in operation is selected for installation on the target. In one embodiment the policy compliant program version corresponding to the user state package program in check operation is logged as a target program to a memory structure of deployment application such as to the target program list earlier described.

In one embodiment where more than one policy compliant program version is identified the policy compliant program having the most recent version is selected. In other embodiments different version selection criteria can be used.

In the present example two policy compliant program versions of Microsoft Word i.e. version 2007 and 2000 are specified in policy . In the present example it is assumed that the most recent version is to be selected and thus in the present example the policy compliant program version Microsoft Word 2007 is selected as the target program. From SELECT POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION AS TARGET PROGRAM operation processing transitions to NEXT check operation as earlier described.

In the present example in NEXT check operation a determination is made there are no further user state package programs to evaluate NO and processing transitions from NEXT check operation to OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S TO INSTALL check operation .

Referring now to in OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S TO INSTALL check operation a determination is automatically made whether other policy compliant program s specified in the policy remain to be selected as target programs. In one embodiment a determination is made whether each policy compliant program that is required to be installed on a target by policy is currently selected as a target program.

Herein in one embodiment a policy compliant program that is required to be installed on a target by a policy is termed a required policy compliant program. In one embodiment a required policy compliant program is identified in a policy e.g. policy using a required program identifier such as required program flag or by otherwise indicating in the policy e.g. policy that an associated policy compliant program is required to be installed on the target.

In one embodiment each required policy compliant program of the policy e.g. policy is automatically compared to each target program identified in the target program list. More particularly in one embodiment each required policy compliant program of the policy e.g. policy is automatically compared to each target program identified in the target program list to determine whether or not there is a corresponding target program.

In one embodiment when each required policy compliant program is determined to correspond to a target program there are no other policy compliant programs to select as target program NO and processing transitions from OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S TO INSTALL check operation to a DEPLOY TARGET PROGRAM S TO TARGET operation described further herein. Alternatively in one embodiment when one or more required policy compliant programs are determined not to correspond to a target program there are other policy compliant programs to select as target programs YES and processing transitions from OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S TO INSTALL check operation to a SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S AS TARGET PROGRAM S operation .

In the present example assume that the policy compliant program Excel is a required policy compliant program. The required policy compliant program Excel is automatically compared to each target program e.g. Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Word 2007 and a determination is made that there no corresponding target programs. Further in the present example there are no other required policy compliant programs to evaluate. Thus in the present example there is an other policy compliant program to install YES and processing transitions from OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S TO INSTALL check operation to a SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S AS TARGET PROGRAM S operation .

In SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S AS TARGET PROGRAM S operation in one embodiment each policy compliant program determined in check operation is automatically selected as a target program. In one embodiment each policy compliant program determined in check operation is logged as a target program to a memory structure of deployment application such as the target program list earlier described. From SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S AS TARGET PROGRAM S operation processing transitions to DEPLOY TARGET PROGRAM S TO TARGET operation .

In DEPLOY TARGET PROGRAM S TO TARGET operation in one embodiment the programs selected as target programs are automatically deployed to the target. In one embodiment deployable programs corresponding to each of the target programs identified in the target list are automatically obtained and are automatically communicated to the target.

In one embodiment deployment application includes or has access to programs including program version update programs which are deployable to and installable on a target such as deployable programs . In one embodiment deployable programs include at least programs corresponding to target programs.

In one embodiment deployment application automatically obtains target programs from deployable programs and automatically communicates the target programs to the target such as in one or more network packages if needed. For example in one embodiment deployment application communicates target programs from host computer system via I O interface over network to target computer system A.

Continuing the present example target programs Microsoft Windows XP selected in operation Microsoft Word 2007 selected in operation and Excel selected in operation are automatically obtained from deployable programs and automatically deployed to computer system A. From DEPLOY TARGET PROGRAM S TO TARGET operation processing transitions to an INSTALL TARGET PROGRAM S TO TARGET operation .

In INSTALL TARGET PROGRAM S TO TARGET operation in one embodiment the target programs deployed in operation are automatically installed on the target e.g. target programs . From INSTALL TARGET PROGRAM s TO TARGET operation processing transitions to a RESTORE USER STATE PACKAGE SETTINGS TO TARGET operation .

In RESTORE USER STATE PACKAGE SETTINGS TO TARGET operation in one embodiment the user state settings identified in user state package e.g. user state settings are automatically deployed and installed on the target as applicable e.g. restored user state settings . For example user state settings in user state package for target programs Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Word 97 are automatically communicated to and installed on the target e.g. computer system A.

In one embodiment none some or all of the user state settings are automatically transformed for use by corresponding target program s installed on the target. In the present example the user state settings associated with Microsoft Word 97 are transformed for use with the target program Microsoft Word 2007 installed on the target. In one embodiment the user state package settings and or transformed user state package settings are automatically stored in one or more registries files and or other structures present on the target for use as settings by the corresponding program. From RESTORE USER STATE PACKAGE SETTINGS TO TARGET operation processing transitions to an optional GENERATE TARGET CONFIGURATION PACKAGE operation or transitions directly to a NOTIFY operation .

In optional GENERATE TARGET CONFIGURATION PACKAGE operation in one embodiment a target configuration package associated with the target is automatically generated. In one embodiment the target configuration package includes at least a listing of the target programs installed on the target. In some embodiments the target configuration package further includes the user state settings including any transformed user state settings installed on the target. From optional GENERATE TARGET CONFIGURATION PACKAGE operation processing transitions to a NOTIFY operation .

In NOTIFY operation in one embodiment the user of host computer system e.g. the system administrator and or other users are automatically notified of the completion of the installation of the target programs and user state settings to the target. In one embodiment a record is automatically generated and provided to the user e.g. system administrator.

In one embodiment the notification identifies the target program s and or user state settings deployed and installed to the target. In some embodiments the notification identifies the user state package programs the policy compliant programs and the target programs.

The user is notified using any one of a number of techniques e.g. by using a pop up window by generating an e mail by writing to a file and or otherwise by logging the event. From NOTIFY operation processing transitions to an EXIT operation with processing exiting method .

In the present embodiment operations through are similarly performed as earlier described with reference to method hereby incorporated by reference except that at selected operations in one embodiment user confirmation of a selection of a program and or program version not identified in the user state package is requested prior to selecting the program and or program version as a target program as further described herein.

More particularly referring now to at POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION check operation when the user state package program version is determined not to correspond to a policy compliant program version NO processing transitions to a REQUEST USER CONFIRM operation . Thus rather than automatically selecting the policy compliant program version as a target program as in operation of method user confirmation is requested as further detailed herein.

In REQUEST USER CONFIRM operation in one embodiment a message prompt or other notification is automatically generated and displayed and or otherwise conveyed to the user requesting user input such as a user confirmation input. In one embodiment user input is requested using any one of a number of techniques for example by using a pop up window.

For example in one embodiment a pop up window is displayed to the user such as on display device with the text query User state package program version Microsoft Word version 97 is not policy compliant. Confirm selection of policy compliant program version Microsoft Word 2007 for installation on target In one embodiment graphical user interface input selection buttons for example YES and NO are displayed to the user.

The user inputs a selection for example by placing a cursor over one of the input selection buttons on display device such as via mouse and clicking on the input selection button to generate a selection i.e. a user input. For example selection of input selection button YES generates a confirmation of the selection of Microsoft Word 2007 as a target program. Alternatively selection of input selection button NO generates a denial of the selection of Microsoft Word 2007 as a target program. From REQUEST USER CONFIRM operation processing transitions to a RECEIVE USER INPUT operation .

In RECEIVE USER INPUT operation in one embodiment the user input is received communicating the selection requested in operation for example a confirmation or a denial is received. From RECEIVE USER INPUT operation processing transitions to a USER CONFIRM check operation .

In USER CONFIRM check operation in one embodiment a determination is automatically made whether or not the user input received in operation confirms the selection of the policy compliant program version as a target program. For example when a confirmation is received in operation the selection of Microsoft Word 2007 as a target program is confirmed. Alternatively when a denial is received in operation the selection of Microsoft Word 2007 as a target program is denied.

In one embodiment if the user input confirms the selection of the policy compliant program version as a target program YES processing transitions from USER CONFIRM check operation to SELECT POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM VERSION AS TARGET PROGRAM operation as earlier described with reference to method hereby incorporated by reference with selection of the policy compliant program version as a target program. Otherwise if the user input does not confirm the selection of the policy compliant program version as a target program NO the policy compliant program version is not selected as a target program and processing transitions from USER CONFIRM check operation to a LOG operation .

In LOG operation in one embodiment the non selection of the policy compliant program version as a target program is logged such as to a text file for later evaluation. From LOG operation processing transitions to NEXT check operation as earlier described with reference to method hereby incorporated by reference.

Additionally referring now to in OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S TO INSTALL check operation when there are one or more other policy compliant programs required to be installed to the target such as required policy compliant programs YES processing transitions from OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S TO INSTALL check operation to a SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM operation .

In SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM operation in one embodiment an initial policy compliant program determined in check operation e.g. a required policy compliant program is automatically selected for comparison to target programs. For example assuming again the program Excel is identified in policy as a required policy compliant program Excel is initially selected. From SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM operation processing transitions to a REQUEST USER CONFIRM operation . Thus rather than automatically selecting each of the policy compliant program s identified in check operation as target programs as in operation of method user confirmation of each policy compliant program identified in check operation is requested as further described herein.

In REQUEST USER CONFIRM operation in one embodiment a message prompt or other notification is automatically generated and displayed and or otherwise conveyed to the user requesting user input such as a user confirmation input. In one embodiment user input is requested using any one of a number of techniques for example by using a pop up window.

For example a pop up window is displayed to the user such as on display device with the text query Policy compliant program Excel is required for installation to the target. Confirm selection of policy compliant program Excel for installation on target In one embodiment graphical user interface input selection buttons for example YES and NO are displayed to the user.

The user inputs a selection for example by placing a cursor over one of the input selection buttons on display device such as via mouse and clicking on the input selection button to generate a selection i.e. a user input. For example selection of input selection button YES generates a confirmation of the selection of Excel as a target program. Alternatively selection of input selection button NO generates a denial of the selection of Excel as a target program. From REQUEST USER CONFIRM operation processing transitions to a RECEIVE USER INPUT operation .

In RECEIVE USER INPUT operation in one embodiment the user input is received communicating the selection requested in operation for example a confirmation or a denial is received. From RECEIVE USER INPUT operation processing transitions to a USER CONFIRM check operation .

In USER CONFIRM check operation in one embodiment a determination is automatically made whether or not the user input received in operation confirms the selection of the policy compliant program as a target program. For example when a confirmation is received in operation the selection of Excel as a target program is confirmed. Alternatively when a denial is received in operation the selection of Excel as a target program is denied.

In one embodiment if the user input confirms the selection of the policy compliant program as a target program YES processing transitions from USER CONFIRM check operation to SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S AS TARGET PROGRAM S operation as earlier described with reference to method hereby incorporated by reference with selection of the policy compliant program as a target program. Otherwise if the user input does not confirm the selection of the policy compliant program as a target program NO the policy compliant program is not selected as a target program and processing transitions from USER CONFIRM check operation to SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S AS TARGET PROGRAM S operation .

In SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S AS TARGET PROGRAM S operation in the present embodiment rather that automatically selecting each required policy compliant program identified in check operation as target program s in one embodiment the individual policy compliant program selected in operation and confirmed in operation is selected as a target program.

In an alternative embodiment similar to the performance of operation in method each of the required policy compliant programs confirmed for selection as target programs in operation is temporarily stored until all the policy compliant programs identified in operation have been either confirmed or denied for selection as a target program and then each of the confirmed policy compliant programs are selected as target programs. From SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM S AS TARGET PROGRAM S operation processing transitions to a NEXT check operation .

In NEXT check operation in one embodiment a determination is made whether a next policy compliant program identified in check operation is to be selected for comparison to target programs. If a next policy compliant program is to be selected for comparison from NEXT check operation processing returns to SELECT OTHER POLICY COMPLIANT PROGRAM operation with a next policy compliant program being selected for comparison. Otherwise if a next policy compliant program is not to be selected for comparison NO from NEXT check operation processing transitions to DEPLOY TARGET PROGRAM S TO TARGET operation as earlier described with reference to method hereby incorporated by reference.

Referring now back again to USER CONFIRM check operation alternatively if the user input does not confirm the selection of the policy compliant program as a target program NO processing transitions from USER CONFIRM check operation to a LOG operation .

In LOG operation in one embodiment the non selection of the required policy compliant program as a target program is logged such as to a text file for later evaluation. From LOG operation processing transitions to NEXT check operation as earlier described.

Referring now to DEPLOY TARGET PROGRAM S TO TARGET operation and processing flows through the remaining operations as earlier described with reference to method with processing exiting method at an EXIT operation .

In some embodiments users are provided an input option of canceling the operations of method and exiting method for example in operations and in which instances processing would transition directly to EXIT operation . In some embodiments where a user does not select a policy compliant program or policy compliant program version a user is provided an input option of installing the user state program and or program version with the non policy compliant selection being logged to a text file such as for later evaluation.

Referring again to although deployment application is referred to as an application this is illustrative only. Deployment application should be capable of being called from an application or the operating system. In one embodiment an application is generally defined to be any executable code. Moreover those of skill in the art will understand that when it is said that an application or an operation takes some action the action is the result of executing one or more instructions by a processor.

While embodiments in accordance with the present invention have been described for a client server configuration an embodiment of the present invention is carried out using any suitable hardware configuration or means involving a personal computer a workstation a portable device or a network of computer devices. Other network configurations other than client server configurations e.g. peer to peer web based intranet and Internet network configurations are used in other embodiments.

Herein a computer program product comprises a medium configured to store or transport computer readable code in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Some examples of computer program products are CD ROM discs DVDs ROM cards floppy discs magnetic tapes computer hard drives servers on a network and signals transmitted over a network representing computer readable code.

In another example a computer program product comprises a tangible medium configured to store computer readable code including CD ROM discs DVDs ROM cards floppy disks magnetic tapes computer hard drives and servers on a network.

As illustrated in this medium belongs to the computer system itself. However the medium is also removable from the computer system. For example deployment application is stored in memory that is physically located in a location different from processor such as on a different computer system coupled to memory . This could be accomplished in a client server system or alternatively via a connection to another computer via modems and analog lines or digital interfaces and a digital carrier line.

More specifically in one embodiment host computer system is a portable computer a workstation a two way pager a cellular telephone a digital wireless telephone a personal digital assistant a server computer an Internet appliance or any other device that includes components that execute deployment application in accordance with at least one of the embodiments as described herein. Similarly in another embodiment host computer system is comprised of multiple different computers wireless devices cellular telephones digital telephones two way pagers personal digital assistants server computers or any desired combination of these devices that are interconnected to perform the methods as described herein.

In view of this disclosure deployment application in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention can be implemented in a wide variety of computer system configurations. In addition deployment application could be stored as different modules in memories of different devices. For example deployment application could initially be stored in a different computer system and as necessary a portion of deployment application could be transferred to host computer system and executed on host computer system . Consequently part of the functionality would be executed on processor of host computer system and another part would be executed on a processor of the different computer system. In view of this disclosure those of skill in the art can implement various embodiments of the present invention in a wide variety of physical hardware configurations using an operating system and computer programming language of interest to the user.

This disclosure provides exemplary embodiments of the present invention. The scope of the present invention is not limited by these exemplary embodiments. Numerous variations whether explicitly provided for by the specification or implied by the specification or not may be implemented by one of skill in the art in view of this disclosure.
