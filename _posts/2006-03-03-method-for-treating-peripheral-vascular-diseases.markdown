The present invention relates to a method for treating peripheral vascular diseases in a mammalian subject using a specific prostaglandin compound. The invention also relates to a composition which is useful for the method.

Vascular diseases are often the result of decreased perfusion in the vascular system or physical or biochemical injury to the blood vessel.

Peripheral vascular disease PVD is defined as a disease of blood vessels often encountered as narrowing of the vessels of the limbs. There are two main types of these disorders functional disease which doesn t involve defects in the blood vessels but rather arises from stimuli such as cold stress or smoking and organic disease which arises from structural defects in the vasculature such as atherosclerotic lesions local inflammation or traumatic injury. This can lead to occlusion of the vessel aberrant blood flow and ultimately to tissue ischemia.

One of the more clinically significant forms of PVD is peripheral artery disease PAD . PAD is often treated by angioplasty and implantation of a stent or by artery by pass surgery. Clinical presentation depends on the location of the occluded vessel. For example narrowing of the artery that supplies blood to the intestine can result in severe postprandial pain in the lower abdomen resulting from the inability of the occluded vessel to meet the increased oxygen demand arising from digestive and absorptive processes. Severe forms the ischemia can lead to intestinal necrosis. Similarly PAD in the leg can lead to intermittent pain usually in the calf that comes and goes with activity. This disorder is known as intermittent claudication IC and can progress to persistent pain while resting ischemic ulceration and even amputation.

Peripheral vascular disease is also manifested in atherosclerotic stenosis of the renal artery which can lead to renal ischemia and kidney dysfunction.

Diabetes mellitus causes a variety of physiological and anatomical irregularities the most prominent of which is the inability of the body to utilize glucose normally which results in hyperglycemia. Chronic diabetes can lead to complications of the vascular system which include atherosclerosis abnormalities involving large and medium size blood vessels macroangiopathy and abnormalities involving small blood vessels microangiopathy such as arterioles and capillaries.

Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of developing one or more foot ulcers as a result of established long term complications of the disease which include impaired nerve function neuropathy and or ischemia.

Local tissue ischemia is a key contributing factor to diabetic foot ulceration. In addition to large vessel disease patients with diabetes suffer further threat to their skin perfusion in at least two additional ways. First by involvement of the non conduit arteries which are detrimentally affected by the process of atherosclerosis. Second and perhaps more importantly by impairment of the microcirculatory control mechanisms small vessel disease . Normally when a body part suffers some form of trauma the body part will as part of the body s healing mechanism experience an increased blood flow. When small vessel disease and ischemia are present as in the case of many diabetics this natural increased blood flow response is significantly reduced. This fact together with the tendency of diabetics to form blood clots thrombosis in the microcirculatory system during low levels of blood flow is believed to be an important factor in ulcer pathogenesis.

Neuropathy is a general term which describes a disease process which leads to the dysfunction of the nervous system and one of the major complications of diabetes mellitus with no well established therapies for either its symptomatic treatment or for prevention of progressive decline in nerve function.

The thickening and leakage of capillaries caused by diabetes primarily affect the eyes retinopathy and kidneys nephropathy . The thickening and leakage of capillaries caused by diabetes are also associated with skin disorders and disorders of the nervous system neuropathy . The eye diseases associated with diabetes are nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy proliferative diabetic retinopathy diabetic maculopathy glaucoma cataracts and the like.

Others although not known to be related to diabetes are similar in their physiological effects on the peripheral vascular system. Such diseases include Raynaud syndrome CREST syndrome autoimmune diseases such as erythematosis rheumatoid disease and the like.

Prostaglandins hereinafter referred to as PG s are members of class of organic carboxylic acids which are contained in tissues or organs of human or other mammals and exhibit a wide range of physiological activity. PGs found in nature primary PGs generally have a prostanoic acid skeleton as shown in the formula A 

On the other hand some of synthetic analogues of primary PGs have modified skeletons. The primary PGs are classified into PGAs PGBs PGCs PGDs PGEs PGFs PGGs PGHs PGIs and PGJs according to the structure of the five membered ring moiety and further classified into the following three types by the number and position of the unsaturated bond at the carbon chain moiety 

Further the PGFs are classified according to the configuration of the hydroxyl group at the 9 position into type the hydroxyl group is of an configuration and type the hydroxyl group is of a configuration .

PGEand PGEand PGEare known to have vasodilation hypotension gastric secretion decreasing intestinal tract movement enhancement uterine contraction diuretic bronchodilation and anti ulcer activities. PGF PGF and PGF have been known to have hypertension vasoconstriction intestinal tract movement enhancement uterine contraction lutein body atrophy and bronchoconstriction activities.

Some 15 keto i.e. having oxo at the 15 position instead of hydroxy PGs and 13 14 dihydro i.e. having single bond between the 13 and 14 position 15 keto PGs are known as the substances naturally produced by the action of enzymes during the metabolism of primary PGs.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 197 821 to Ueno et al. describes that some 15 keto PGE compounds are an antagonist for endothelin which is considered to have a relation to hypertension Buerger disease asthma eyegrounds diseases and the like the cited reference is herein incorporated by reference .

U.S. Pat. No. 6 197 821 indicates that when the bond between 13 and 14 positions is saturated a keto hemiacetal equilibrium may sometimes be formed by the formation of a hemiacetal between the hydroxy group at 11 position and the keto group at 15 position the cited reference is herein incorporated by reference .

U.S. Pat. No. 5 317 032 to Ueno et al. describes prostaglandin compound cathartics including the existence of bicyclic tautomers and U.S. Pat. No. 6 414 016 to Ueno describes the bicyclic tautomers as having pronounced activity as anti constipation agents the cited references are herein incorporated by reference . The bicyclic tautomers substituted by one or more halogen atoms can be employed in small doses for relieving constipation. At the C 16 position especially fluorine atoms can be employed in small doses for relieving constipation.

Currently used oral drugs for peripheral vascular diseases include cilostazol commercial name Pletaal and prostaglandin PG preparations commercial names Dorner Opalmon etc. having a vasodilative effect as well as an antiplatelet effect ticlopidine mainly having an antiplatelet effect commercial name Panaldine sarpogrelate commercial name Anplag and ethyl icosapentate commercial name Epadel which is also adaptable to hyperlipemia. They have different action mechanisms so that it may be required to use two or three preparations in combination depending on pathology. Particularly in medium illness multiple drugs are more likely to be applied. Injectable preparations include prostaglandin E1 preparations antithrombin preparations commercial name Argatroban . They are in principle used for medium or more severe illness requiring hospitalization.

The efficacy of the existing drugs is not wholly satisfactory. Particularly antiplatelets such as ticlopidine or ethyl icosapentate are less effective probably because it is unclear to which extent platelets are involved in each pathology or whether the vasodilative effect is sufficient even if a drug has such an effect or whether bloodstream at ischemic sites can be selectively enough ensured.

The present inventor conducted an intensive study and found that 11 deoxy prostaglandin compounds possessed selective significant effects on the peripheral vascular diseases which resulted in the completion of the present invention.

Namely the present invention relates to a method for treating a peripheral vascular disease in a mammalian subject which comprises administering an effective amount of a 11 deoxy prostaglandin compound to the subject in need thereof.

The present invention further relates to a composition for treating a peripheral vascular disease in a mammalian subject which comprises an effective amount of a 11 deoxy prostaglandin compound.

Furthermore the present invention relates to use of a 11 deoxy prostaglandin compound for manufacturing a composition for treating a peripheral vascular disease in a mammalian subject wherein the composition comprises an effective amount of a 11 deoxy prostaglandin compound.

Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for treating damaged peripheral vascular wall and or peripheral vascular endothelial cells in a mammalian subject which comprises administering an effective amount of a 11 deoxy prostaglandin compound to the subject in need thereof.

In the present invention the 11 deoxy prostaglandin compound hereinafter referred to as 11 deoxy PG compound may include any of derivatives or analogs including substituted derivatives of a compound having no substituent at 11 position of the prostanoic acid skeleton irrespective of the configuration of the five membered ring the number of double bonds presence or absence of a substituent or any other modification in the or chain.

The formula A shows a basic skeleton of the C 20 carbon atoms but the present invention is not limited to those having the same number of carbon atoms. In the formula A the numbering of the carbon atoms which constitute the basic skeleton of the PG compounds starts at the carboxylic acid numbered 1 and carbon atoms in the chain are numbered 2 to 7 towards the five membered ring those in the ring are 8 to 12 and those in the chain are 13 to 20. When the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the chain the number is deleted in the order starting from position 2 and when the number of carbon atoms is increased in the chain compounds are named as substitution compounds having respective substituents at position 2 in place of the carboxy group C 1 . Similarly when the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the chain the number is deleted in the order starting from position 20 and when the number of carbon atoms is increased in the chain the carbon atoms beyond position 20 are named as substituents. Stereochemistry of the compounds is the same as that of the above formula A unless otherwise specified.

As stated above the nomenclature of the 11 deoxy PG compounds is based on the prostanoic acid skeleton. However in case the compound has a similar partial structure as a prostaglandin the abbreviation of PG may be used. Thus a 11 deoxy PG compound of which chain is extended by two carbon atoms that is having 9 carbon atoms in the chain is named as 2 decarboxy 2 2 carboxyethyl 11 deoxy PG compound. Similarly 11 deoxy PG compound having 11 carbon atoms in the chain is named as 2 decarboxy 2 4 carboxybutyl 11 deoxy PG compound. Further 11 deoxy PG compound of which chain is extended by two carbon atoms that is having 10 carbon atoms in the chain is named as 11 deoxy 20 ethyl PG compound. These compounds however may also be named according to the IUPAC nomenclatures.

Examples of the analogs including substituted derivatives or derivatives include a 11 deoxy PG compound of which carboxy group at the end of chain is esterified a compound of which chain is extended physiologically acceptable salt thereof a Compound having a double bond at 2 3 position or a triple bond at position 5 6 a compound having substituent s at position 3 5 6 16 17 18 19 and or 20 and a compound having lower alkyl or a hydroxy lower alkyl group at position 9 in place of the hydroxy group.

Stereochemistry of PGs having hydroxy lower alkyl or hydroxy lower alkyl substituent at position 9 may be or a mixture thereof.

Further the above analogs or derivatives may be compounds having an alkoxy cycloalkyl cycloalkyloxy phenoxy or phenyl group at the end of the chain where the chain is shorter than the primary PGs.

A cannula was inserted into the common carotid artery of the rabbit under inhalation anesthesia of isoflurane. Nine parts of the blood samples obtained through the cannula were mixed with 1 part of 3.8 w v sodium citrate. After centrifugation of the blood samples for 10 min at 1 000 rpm platelet rich plasma PRP was collected from the top layer. Then the bottom layer was further centrifuged for 15 min at 3 000 rpm and platelet poor plasma PPP was collected from the top layer. The platelet counts of the PRP and PPP fractions were performed using an ADVIA120 Hematology system ADVIA120 Bayer Medical Ltd. . The PRP fraction was diluted with the PPP fraction so that the platelet counts was adjusted to approximately 30 10cells L. Thus obtained PRP 0.178 mL was put into a cuvet and pre incubated on a warm bath at 37 C. for about 5 minutes. Test solution 0.022 mL containing prostaglandin E1 or Compound A was added to the PRP. One minute later 25 M ADP solution 0.022 mL was added and the degree of platelet aggregation was measured using a platelet aggregation measuring device NBS hematolaser Nikko Bioscience Inc. . For each test solution a duplicate test was performed on the blood samples from 3 animals. Inhibition rate was evaluated by comparing the aggregation in the test substance group with that in the vehicle control group 100 .

As shown in Table 3 prostaglandin E PGE inhibited platelet aggregation by 20.9 91.2 and 89.0 at concentrations of 1 10 1 10and 1 10g mL respectively. On the other hand Compound A showed no effect on platelet aggregation up to the highest concentration 1 10g mL tested. The results indicate that Compound A has no effect on platelet aggregation.
