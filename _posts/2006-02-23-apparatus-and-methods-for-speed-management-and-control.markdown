The disclosed embodiments relate to wireless devices and wireless communication networks and more particularly to apparatus and methods for speed management and speed control of a vehicle through a wireless device on a wireless network.

The driver of a vehicle should be aware of the speed limit of the road upon which they are driving. Unfortunately currently the only way for a driver to know the speed limit of a road is to observe posted speed limit signs or to know the rules of a given city area or type of road as to the speed limit when no signs are posted. Posted speed limit signs are problematic because such signs may only be located infrequently on any given stretch of road. As such a driver turning onto the road may not be notified of the speed limit in a timely manner. Another disadvantage of such posted speed limit signs is that they are often obstructed from view by trees shrubs and other signs. Further even if not obstructed such speed limit signs may be difficult to see among the myriad of signs and advertisements typically found in urban and suburban areas. Additionally if a driver is new to a particular stretch of road or is trying to find a location on the road such posted speed limit signs may be outside of the driver s focus of attention and may be easily missed. Thus posted speed limit signs often provide less than adequate notice of the speed limit for that road to a driver of a vehicle.

Alternately many drivers are not familiar with local speed limit rules such as on city streets where speed limit signs are often not posted. For example these areas rely on postings located at the perimeter of the area such as a sign reading city speed limit of 25 mph unless otherwise posted and if the driver does not notice these signs prior to entering the area they may never again be notified of the speed limit within the area. Thus many drivers lack knowledge of the rules of a given city area or type of road as to the speed limit.

There are systems such as cruise control systems that help a driver to maintain a vehicle at a desired speed limit value set by the driver. The disadvantage of these systems however is that the desired speed limit value will not change until manually altered or cancelled. These cruise control systems do not include any mechanism to notify the driver of a speed limit of a road or to automatically adjust the desired speed limit value based upon a change in the speed limit of the road.

Therefore improved apparatus and methods are desired to aid a driver in managing and controlling the speed of a vehicle in relation to a speed limit for the road or transit route upon which they are traveling.

To address one or more of the drawbacks of the prior art the disclosed embodiments provide apparatus and methods for speed management and control.

In one embodiment a method of speed management and control comprises receiving a present geographic position of a wireless device determining a speed limit corresponding to the present geographic position and selectively generating an alert based upon the speed limit.

In another embodiment a method of speed management and control comprises determining a present geographic position of a wireless device and referencing a database on the wireless device having a plurality of geographic location data associated with a plurality of speed limit data. The method further includes matching the present geographic position with one of the plurality of geographic location data and then identifying a speed limit as the one of the plurality of speed limit data corresponding to the matched one of the plurality of geographic location data. Additionally the method includes selectively generating an alert on the wireless device based upon the speed limit. A further embodiment includes a computer readable medium executable by a processor to perform the above stated actions.

In yet another embodiment an apparatus for speed management and control comprises a determination means for determining a present geographic position of a wireless device. The apparatus further includes a referencing means for referencing a database on the wireless device having a plurality of geographic location data associated with a plurality of speed limit data. Also the apparatus includes a matching means for matching the present geographic location with one of the plurality of geographic location data. Further the apparatus includes an identification means for identifying a speed limit as the one of the plurality of speed limit data corresponding to the matched one of the plurality of geographic location data. Additionally the apparatus includes a first generating means for selectively generating an alert on the wireless device based upon the speed limit and a second generating means for generating a speed control signal based on the speed limit where the speed control signal is operable to change a speed of movement of the wireless device on a transit route.

In still another embodiment a wireless device comprises a computer platform and a speed management module executable by the computer platform. The speed management module being operable to receive a geographic position associated with the wireless device and further operable to determine a speed limit corresponding to the geographic position. Additionally the speed management module being further operable to generate an alert based upon the speed limit.

Additional aspects and advantages of the disclosed embodiments are set forth in part in the description which follows and in part are obvious from the description or may be learned by practice of the disclosed embodiments. The aspects and advantages of the disclosed embodiments may also be realized and attained by the means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

The disclosed embodiments include apparatus methods and computer readable media for the management and control of a speed of movement associated with a wireless device. These apparatus and methods provide a wireless device with logic that enables the wireless device to automatically determine a speed limit of a transit route such as a road corresponding to the geographic position of the device. As such the wireless device may generate an output to notify an end user of the speed limit and may further generate speed control signals to automatically initiate a change in an actual speed associated with the wireless device such as the speed of a vehicle carrying the wireless device.

Referring to one embodiment of a speed management and control system includes a wireless device having a resident speed management module that determines a current speed limit for a transit route associated with a present geographic position of the wireless device. Resident speed management module may then generate an alert based on the current speed limit . For instance alert may be some type of user recognizable indicator associated with the current speed limit generated by an output mechanism such as a graphic representing the current speed limit displayable on a display module of wireless device . Further resident speed management module may monitor and or control an actual speed associated with movement of wireless device based on speed limit . For instance resident speed management module may generate a speed control signal including a desired speed that is based on speed limit for use by a speed control system of a vehicle associated with wireless device . For example speed control system receives desired speed and operates to maintain actual speed of vehicle within a predetermined range of desired speed . Thus speed management and control system includes a wireless device having a resident speed management module for determining and notifying a user of the current speed limit based on the present geographic position of the wireless device and may additionally provide a speed control signal to vehicle associated with wireless device to match actual speed with desired speed .

In one embodiment referring to to determine speed limit associated with transit route resident speed management module includes logic which executes to determine the present geographic position of wireless device . For instance such logic may include a resident speed management application that executes to initiate operation of additional logic such as a resident location module to estimate the present geographic position of wireless device . For example resident location module may include logic executable to wirelessly exchange communications with a geographic information system Block which includes location determination system such as an orbiting global positioning system and or a remote location module situated across a wireless network . Resident location module operates with these exchanged communications and data to determine the present geographic position of wireless device Block . For example resident location module or the geographic information system typically determines the present geographic position by performing triangulation calculations to estimate a position location based on the timing and or distance associated with communications messages and data exchanged between wireless device and a plurality of geographic information system stations such as satellites and or cellular base stations. Once the present geographic position is determined resident speed management application executes to locally determine the corresponding current speed limit Block . For example resident speed management application executes to reference to a local speed limit database that associates a plurality of geographic location data with a plurality of speed limit data . Further resident speed management application executes to match present geographic position with one of the plurality of geographic location data and thereby finds the associated speed limit data that defines current speed limit .

Upon determining the current speed limit resident speed management application may then execute to generate transmit and or present alert Blocks . Alert may be generated transmitted and or presented on either a continuous basis or a selective basis for example based on predetermined time intervals or predetermined events. Predetermined events may include for example a change in the speed limit a condition where the current setting of the desired speed is outside of a predetermined range of the current speed limit a condition where the existing actual speed is outside of a predetermined range of the current speed limit and a condition of detecting a change in the current speed limit. For instance in a speed limit monitoring mode resident speed management application may compare current speed limit with a previously stored speed limit associated with a previous geographic position of wireless device and generate alert if there is a difference between the two values that exceeds a predetermined speed limit relationship . Similarly in a speed monitoring mode resident speed management application may execute to compare current speed limit with desired speed and or actual speed and generate alert if there is a difference between the values that exceeds a predetermined speed control relationship . Additionally as mentioned above alert may include an indication of current speed limit an indication of a change in current speed limit as well as other associated predetermined messages . For example predetermined messages may include but are not limited to a warning that the speed limit has increased or decreased based on a comparison of current speed limit and prior speed limit an indication of actual speed an indication of desired speed a representation of the geographical area and or a transit route map of the present geographical position a representation of a special road condition such as slippery when wet icy a downhill decline and angle degrees uphill recommendation to use lower gear turning on the headlights railroad tracks ahead narrow bridge a warning of special zoning such as school zone construction zone any road sign can be in the database and can therefore be automatically accessed and displayed a warning of a speed condition such as actual speed being above speed limit actual speed being below speed limit actual speed being about equal to speed limit actual speed being within a predetermined range of speed limit and actual speed being outside of the predetermined range of the speed limit etc. After outputting alert Block the system may resume operation to determine the current geographic location and associated speed limit Block .

The system can also anticipate an upcoming event road condition based on current geographic location or current geographic location and current velocity speed and heading or alternatively based on current geographic location current speed and geographic map. The system therefore can provide alerts that include advance notifications of such upcoming events road conditions.

Optionally after determining speed limit corresponding to the present geographic position resident speed management module may generate speed control signal Block . For example resident speed management application may execute to compare current speed limit with previously stored speed limit and if they do not match generate desired speed limit based on speed limit . Desired speed limit may be equal to speed limit or desired speed limit may have some predetermined desired relationship to speed limit . For example predetermined desired relationship may be a selectable speed limit value above or below current speed limit . Further resident speed management module may transmit speed control signal including desired speed for receipt by vehicle in order to control the speed of the vehicle Block Block . Optionally resident speed management module may include logic to ensure that vehicle has properly received speed control signal Block . For example resident speed management application may execute to check for receipt of a confirmation from vehicle that speed control signal has been received and either retransmit speed control signal Block if a receipt confirmation is not received in a predetermined time or resume operation to determine the current speed limit based on the present geographic position Block . Correspondingly vehicle includes logic to transmit a receipt confirmation to wireless device to verify that speed control signal was received Block . Alternatively the resident speed management module may include logic for determining the change in the actual speed in order to verify the response of the vehicle to the speed control signal i.e. the actual speed is decreasing from value v to value v v in a time interval T as expected in response to the speed control signal .

Further vehicle includes logic such as speed control system to update a stored value of desired speed with the newly received value of desired speed Block . Further speed control system includes logic that operates to match actual speed to desired speed Block . For example performing such a match may include monitoring logic that determines and compares actual speed with desired speed where adjustments to actual speed are made until actual speed equals desired speed or until actual speed is within predetermined range of desired speed . Predetermined range may be a range of speeds set by the manufacturer of speed control system or which may be a range of speeds configurable by a user or by resident speed management module . For example predetermined range may be a range of speeds to ensure that the actual speed will be below the maximum and above the minimum desired speed e.g. the user may not want to ever exceed 60 mph even though the current speed limit may be 65 mph. Optionally speed control system may include logic that transmits the detected actual speed to wireless device Block where it may be stored and utilized in the operations of resident speed management module .

Additionally resident speed management module may include logic for determining actual speed Block . For example resident speed management application may include logic to calculate actual speed based on a change in geographic positions over time. Alternatively resident speed management application may include logic to exchange communications with and receive actual speed from vehicle see Block . In yet a further option resident speed management application may include logic to exchange communications with and receive actual speed from remote location module which may include logic to calculate actual speed based on a change in geographic positions over time or based on a direct speed reading from a GPS system. For example typical GPS systems allow Doppler based speed calculation not necessarily relying on the change in the position and such determinations can be done either in the resident module or in remote module . As such the logic of resident speed management module may generate alert Block and or speed control signal Block based on actual speed .

Rather than having the system automatically generate speed control signal resident speed management module may receive a user input of desired speed Block such as in response to the presentation of alert on output mechanism Block . For example a user of vehicle and or wireless device may provide a desired speed input to an input mechanism of wireless device . Input mechanism includes but is not limited to a keyboard a touchpad a touch screen display an audio input recognition mechanism etc. As such resident speed management module includes logic to incorporate this manually entered desired speed into the generated speed control signal Block . In one example desired speed input may represent a desired maximum speed.

Further resident speed management module may execute to exchange communications with vehicle or with remote location module across wireless network to receive actual speed . For instance speed control system of vehicle may monitor actual speed and selectively forward its value to resident speed management module . The selective forwarding of actual speed may be a setting determined by resident speed management module . For example the selective forwarding of actual speed by speed control system may be continuous or based on receipt of a request from resident speed management module or based on a predetermined change in actual speed or based on a predetermined deviation from desired speed or other predetermined speed related event. Alternatively remote location module may include logic executable to estimate actual speed based upon a change in geographic position over time. In another example remote location module may include logic executable to estimate actual speed based upon instantaneous GPS measurement. In this case remote location module may operate to selectively transmit actual speed across wireless network to resident speed management application to perform the operations described above. For example in a speed monitoring mode resident speed management application may execute to compare current speed limit with actual speed and generate alert if there is a difference between the values that exceeds predetermined speed control relationship .

Further resident speed management module may execute to exchange communications with resident location module to receive actual speed . For example GPS Doppler pseudorange rate measurements allow computation of vehicle velocity speed and heading .

In another embodiment referring to instead of determining current speed limit locally on wireless device system may be configured so that remote speed management module determines current speed limit based on the present geographic position . For example remote speed management application may include logic executable to receive the exchanged location determination related communications between wireless device and remote location module Block . Further remote speed management application includes logic to determine present geographic position based on the exchanged communications with wireless device Block . For example remote speed management application executes to generate the present geographic position in a similar manner as described above with reference to resident speed management application . In this case however remote speed management application operates by accessing a remote speed limit database which may be essentially equivalent to local speed limit database . Alternatively remote location module may include similar logic and data to determine and transmit present geographic position to remote speed management application . In yet another alternative remote speed management application may receive present geographic position from wireless device . Once present geographic position is determined in this embodiment remote speed management application executes to generate speed limit based on the present geographic location in the manner described above Block . Once speed limit is determined in this embodiment remote speed management application may execute to transmit speed limit across wireless network to resident speed management module to perform the operations described above Block . Alternatively remote speed management application may include the logic enabling execution to generate alert and or speed control signal in a similar manner as that described above with respect to resident speed management application Block . In this case remote speed management application may then execute to forward alert and or speed control signal including desired speed across wireless network to resident speed management module Block . Upon receipt of this information resident speed management module may then operate as described above to transmit alert to output mechanism and or to transmit speed control signal to vehicle .
