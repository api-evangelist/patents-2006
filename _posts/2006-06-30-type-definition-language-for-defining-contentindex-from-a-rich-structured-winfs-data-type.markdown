Storage systems such as WinFS Microsoft Windows Future Storage or Microsoft Windows File System for example allow different kinds of data to be identified by metadata and uses it to set up relationships among data thereby giving a semantic structure to the data. These relationships can then be used by a relational database to enable searching and dynamic aggregation of the data allowing the data to be presented in a variety of ways. WinFS includes a relational database engine derived from the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 SQL database platform to facilitate this.

Content indexing of WinFS data is strategically important for allowing WinFS applications and users to search and find data stored in WinFS stores without having to necessarily know the structure of the data. It enables applications to provide end users with richer and advanced data exploration capabilities over WinFS items making it easier for users to find their information.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In consideration of the above identified shortcomings of the art defining content indexable data from a rich structured type and it s processing is provided. For several embodiments a method for providing content index information for a data item comprises providing a schema containing content index definitions using the prescribed language for the item generating appropriate query language statements for content index data extraction based on the schema and storing the generated query language statements in a file system store as part of it s processing.

Also a system for defining content indexable properties in rich structured data types comprises means for a schema designer to annotate type properties in the schema by marking said type properties for content indexing using an XML based type definition language.

It should be understood that the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or where appropriate with a combination of both. Thus the methods and apparatus of the invention or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention.

Such programs are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

Although exemplary embodiments may refer to utilizing aspects of the invention in the context of one or more stand alone computer systems the invention is not so limited but rather may be implemented in connection with any computing environment such as a network or distributed computing environment. Still further aspects of the invention may be implemented in or across a plurality of processing chips or devices and storage may similarly be effected across a plurality of devices. Such devices might include personal computers network servers handheld devices supercomputers or computers integrated into other systems such as automobiles and airplanes.

In light of the diverse computing environments that may be built according to the general framework provided in the systems and methods provided herein cannot be construed as limited in any way to a particular computing architecture. Instead the invention should not be limited to any single embodiment but rather should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.

Referring next to shown is an exemplary networked computing environment in which many computerized processes may be implemented to perform the processes described above. For example parallel computing may be part of such a networked environment with various clients on the network of using and or implementing the defining and extracting of a flat list of search properties from a rich structured type. One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that networks can connect any computer or other client or server device or in a distributed computing environment. In this regard any computer system or environment having any number of processing memory or storage units and any number of applications and processes occurring simultaneously is considered suitable for use in connection with the systems and methods provided.

Distributed computing provides sharing of computer resources and services by exchange between computing devices and systems. These resources and services include the exchange of information cache storage and disk storage for files. Distributed computing takes advantage of network connectivity allowing clients to leverage their collective power to benefit the entire enterprise. In this regard a variety of devices may have applications objects or resources that may implicate the processes described herein.

This network may itself comprise other computing entities that provide services to the system of and may itself represent multiple interconnected networks. In accordance with an aspect of the invention each entity and may contain discrete functional program modules that might make use of an API or other object software firmware and or hardware to request services of one or more of the other entities and .

It can also be appreciated that an object such as may be hosted on another computing device . Thus although the physical environment depicted may show the connected devices as computers such illustration is merely exemplary and the physical environment may alternatively be depicted or described comprising various digital devices such as PDAs televisions MP3 players etc. software objects such as interfaces COM objects and the like.

There are a variety of systems components and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example computing systems may be connected together by wired or wireless systems by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently many networks are coupled to the Internet which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks. Any such infrastructures whether coupled to the Internet or not may be used in conjunction with the systems and methods provided.

A network infrastructure may enable a host of network topologies such as client server peer to peer or hybrid architectures. The client is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group to which it is not related. In computing a client is a process i.e. roughly a set of instructions or tasks that requests a service provided by another program. The client process utilizes the requested service without having to know any working details about the other program or the service itself. In a client server architecture particularly a networked system a client is usually a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer e.g. a server. In the example of any entity and can be considered a client a server or both depending on the circumstances.

A server is typically though not necessarily a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network such as the Internet. The client process may be active in a first computer system and the server process may be active in a second computer system communicating with one another over a communications medium thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects may be distributed across multiple computing devices or objects.

Client s and server s communicate with one another utilizing the functionality provided by protocol layer s . For example HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP is a common protocol that is used in conjunction with the World Wide Web WWW or the Web. Typically a computer network address such as an Internet Protocol IP address or other reference such as a Universal Resource Locator URL can be used to identify the server or client computers to each other. The network address can be referred to as a URL address. Communication can be provided over a communications medium e.g. client s and server s may be coupled to one another via TCP IP connection s for high capacity communication.

In light of the diverse computing environments that may be built according to the general framework provided in and the further diversification that can occur in computing in a network environment such as that of the systems and methods provided herein cannot be construed as limited in any way to a particular computing architecture or operating system. Instead the invention should not be limited to any single embodiment but rather should be construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the appended claims.

Although the concepts ideas and features described herein are described in an exemplary fashion with respect to how they are implemented in a file system called Microsoft Windows Future Storage or Microsoft Windows File System WinFS and the Microsoft Windows Vista operating system formerly code named Longhorn implementations in and applicability to other operating and file systems are contemplated entirely possible and apparent to those skilled in the art based on the exemplary descriptions provided herein. Provided below is a background and overview of WinFS largely from http en.wikipedia.org wiki WinFS including description of the data storage data model type system relationships rules access control data retrieval search and data sharing aspects of WinFS.

WinFS is a data storage and management system based on relational databases developed by Microsoft Corp. headquartered in Redmond Wash. for use as an advanced storage subsystem for the Microsoft Windows operating system.

Implemented on top of the NT File System NTFS one of the file systems for the Microsoft Windows NT operating system WinFS is a centralized data store for the Microsoft Windows platform. It allows different kinds of data to be identified by metadata and uses them to set up relationships among data thereby giving a semantic structure to the data. These relationships can then be used by a relational database to enable searching and dynamic aggregation of the data allowing the data to be presented in a variety of ways. WinFS includes a relational database engine derived from the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 SQL database platform to facilitate this.

Previously file systems viewed files and other file system objects only as a stream of bytes and had no information regarding the data that is stored in the files. They also provided only a single way of organizing the files and that is via folders and file names. Because such a file system has no knowledge about the data it stores the applications creating the file tend to use specific often proprietary file formats i.e. the data can be interpreted only by the application that created it. This leads to proliferation of application specific file formats and hampers sharing of data between multiple applications. It becomes difficult to create an application which processes information from multiple file types because the programmers have to understand the structure of all the files where the source data could reside and then figure out how to filter out the necessary information from all the information that will be stored in the file. If more than one file type stores the same data in different formats it becomes necessary to convert them to a single format before they can be used. Though common file formats can be used as a workaround to this problem they do not present a universal solution there is no guarantee that any given application will be able to access the data.

As a result of the above mentioned properties of file systems data from multiple applications cannot be easily aggregated. The only knowledge that the file system has about the data is the name of the file the data is stored in. As a result of this file systems can retrieve and search data based only on the filename. A better solution would be the use of attributes independently exposed by each file recognizable by either the file system natively or via some extension. Attributes are metadata about the files such as type of file e.g. document picture music etc. creator artist etc. This allows files to be searched for by its attributes in ways not possible using only the folder hierarchy such as finding pictures which have person X . Desktop search applications take this concept a step further. They index the files including the attributes and using file filters extract data from different file formats. Different filters have to be used for different file formats. This allows for searching on both the file s attributes and the data contained in the file.

However they still don t promote data sharing as the data they extract is stored in a format specific to the desktop search application in a format which enables fast searching. Desktop search applications can only find information and can t help users with anything that needs to be done with the searched information. Also this approach doesn t solve the problem of aggregating data from two or more applications. For example it is nearly impossible to search for the phone numbers of all persons who lives in some city X and has more than 100 appearances in my collection of photos and with whom I have had e mail within last month. Such a search encompasses data across three applications address book for phone numbers and address photo manager for information on who appears in which photo and the e mail application to know the e mail acquaintances.

This is where WinFS comes into effect. The artificial organization using names and location is done away with and a more natural organization is created one using attributes to describe the data in files and the relation of that data with other data. By creating a unified datastore it promotes sharing and reuse of data between different applications. The advantage is that any application or even the file browser can understand files created by any application. Addition of attributes will give further meaning to the data such as which persons appear in which pictures and the person an e mail was addressed to. But instead of viewing the pictures and e mails and files WinFS recognizes picture and e mail to be specific types of data which are related to person using the relation of some person. So by following the relation a picture can be used to aggregate e mails from all the persons in the picture and conversely an e mail can aggregate all pictures in which the addressee appears in. WinFS extends this to understand any arbitrary types of data and the relations that hold them together. The types and relations have to be specified by the application that stores the data or the user and WinFS organizes the data accordingly.

WinFS stores data in virtual locations called stores. A WinFS store is a common repository where every application will store their data along with its metadata relationships and information on how to interpret the data. In this way WinFS does away with the folder hierarchy and allows searching across the entire repository of data.

WinFS store is actually a relational store where applications can store their structured as well as unstructured data. Based on the meta data metadata type of data and also the relationships of the data with other data as will be specified by the application or the user WinFS will assign a relational structure to the data. By using the relationships WinFS aggregates related data. WinFS provides a unified storage but stops short of defining the format that is to be stored in the data stores. Instead it supports data to be written in application specific formats. But applications must provide a schema that defines how the file format should be interpreted. For example a schema could be added to allow WinFS to understand how to read and thus be able to search and analyze say a Portable Document Format PDF file. By using the schema any application can read data from any other application and also allows different applications from writing in each other s format by sharing the schema.

Multiple WinFS stores can be created on a single machine. This allows different classes of data to be kept segregated for example official documents and personal documents can be kept in different stores. WinFS by default provides only one store named DefaultStore. WinFS stores are exposed as shell objects akin to virtual folders which dynamically generates a list of all items present in the store and presents them in a folder view. The shell object also allows searching information in the datastore.

WinFS is not a physical file system. Rather it provides rich data modeling capabilities on top of the NTFS file system. It still uses NTFS to store its data in physical files. WinFS uses a relational engine which is derived from Microsoft SQL Server 2005 to provide the data relations mechanism as the relation system in WinFS is very similar to the relation system used in relational databases. WinFS stores are SQL Server database .MDF files with the FILESTREAM attribute set. These files are stored in secured folder named System Volume Information placed into the volume root in folders under the folder WinFS with names of GUIDs of these stores.

WinFS also allows programmatic access to its features for example via a set of Microsoft .NET .NET application programming interfaces APIs that enables applications to define custom made data types define relationships among data store and retrieve information and allow advanced searches. The applications can then use novel ways of aggregating data and presenting the aggregated data to the user.

A data unit that has to be stored in a WinFS store is called a WinFS item. A WinFS item along with the core data item also contains information on how the data item is related with other data. A WinFS Item can further consist of sub entities called Fragments. WinFS allows Items and Fragments to be related together in different ways. The different types of relationships are 

WinFS helps in unification of data and thus reduce redundancies. If different applications store data in a non interoperable way data has to be duplicated across applications which deal with same data. For example if more than one e mail application is used the list of contacts must be duplicated across the two. So when there is any need for updating contact information it must be done at two places. If by mistake it is not updated in one of the applications it will continue to have outdated information. But with WinFS an application can store all the contact information in a WinFS store and supply the schema in which it is stored. Then other applications can use the stored data. By doing so duplicate data is removed and with it the hassles of manually synchronizing all instances of the data.

WinFS models data using the data items along with its relationships extensions and rules governing its usage. WinFS needs to understand the type and structure of the data items so that the information stored in the data item can be made available to any application that requests it. This is done by the use of schemas. For every type of data item that is to be stored in WinFS a corresponding schema needs to be provided which will define the type structure and associations of the data. These schemas are defined for example using Extensible Markup Language XML . XML allows designers to create their own customized tags enabling the definition transmission validation and interpretation of data between applications and between organizations.

Predefined WinFS schemas include schemas for messages contacts calendar file items etc and also includes system schemas that include configuration programs and other system related data. Custom schemas can be defined on a per application basis in situations where an application wants to store its data in WinFS but not share the structure of that data with other applications or they can be made available across the system.

The most important difference between other file systems and WinFS is that WinFS knows the type of each data item that it stores and the type specifies the properties of the data item. The WinFS type system is closely associated with the .NET Framework s concept of classes and inheritance. A new type can be created by extending and nesting any predefined types.

Referring next to shown is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary type hierarchy. Shown is item defined by other items contact document and picture nested within it.

In particular WinFS provides four predefined base types Items Relationships ScalarTypes and ComplexTypes. An Item is the fundamental data object which can be stored and a Relationship is the relation or link between two data items. Generally since all WinFS items must have a type the type of item stored defines its properties. The properties of an Item may be a ScalarType which defines the smallest unit of information a property can have or a ComplexType which is a collection of more than one ScalarTypes and or ComplexTypes. All WinFS types are made available as .NET Common Language Runtime CLR classes. CLR is the core runtime engine in the Microsoft .NET Framework for executing applications.

Any object represented as a data unit such as contact picture document etc can be stored in a WinFS store as a specialization of the Item type. By default WinFS provides Item types for Files Contacts Calendar and Messages. The File Item can store any generic data which is stored in file systems as files. But unless an advanced schema is provided for the file by defining it to be a specialized Item WinFS will not be able to access its data. Such a file Item can only support being related to other Items. A developer can extend any of these types or the base type Item to provide a type for his or her custom data.

Referring next to shown is a block diagram illustrating an example use of the predefined types in defining a new type. The data contained in an Item is defined in terms of properties or fields which hold the actual data. For example an Item Contact may have a field Name which is a ScalarType and one field Address a ComplexType which is further composed of two ScalarTypes Street and City . To define this type the base class Item is extended and the necessary fields are added to the class. A ComplexType field can be defined as another class which contains the two ScalarType fields. Once the type is defined a schema has to be defined which denotes the primitive type of each field for example the Name field is a String the Address field is a custom defined Address class both the fields of which are Strings. Other primitive types that WinFS supports are Integer Byte Decimal Float Double Boolean and DateTime among others. The schema will also define which fields are mandatory and which are optional. The Contact Item defined in this way will be used to store information regarding the Contact by populating the properties field and storing it. Only those fields marked as mandatory needs to be filled up during initial save. Other fields may be populated later by the user or not populated at all. If more properties fields such as last conversed date needs to be added this type can be simply extended to accommodate them. Item types for other data can be defined similarly.

Referring next to shown is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary relation stored as a reference to a particular row in the table of an item. WinFS creates a table for all defined Items . All the fields defined for the Item form the columns of the table and all instances of the Item are stored as rows in the table for the respective Item . A Relation is stored as a reference to the particular row in the table of the Item which holds the instance of the target Item with which the current Item is related. All Items are exposed as .NET CLR objects with uniform interface providing access to the data stored in the fields. Thus any application can retrieve object of any Item type and can use the data in the object without being bothered about the physical structure the data was stored in.

Items can be related to one more other items giving rise to a one to one relationship or with more than one item resulting in a one to many relationship. The related items in turn may be related to other data items as well resulting in a network of relationships which is called a many to many relationship. Creating a relationship between two items creates another field in the data of the items concerned which refer to the row in the other item s table where the related object is stored.

Referring next to shown is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary relationship between two items Item Reference . A Relationship represents a mapping between two items a Source e.g. a picture item and a Target a e.g. a contact item . From the point of view of the Source item the relationship is an Outgoing Relationship whereas from that of the target item it is an Incoming Relationship. Relationships are bidirectional which means that if Source is related with Target the Target is also related with the Source . WinFS provides three types of primitive relationships Containment ItemReference Condition based association.

WinFS includes Rules which are executed when certain condition is met. WinFS rules work on data and data relationships. For example a rule can be created which states that whenever an Item is created which contains field Name and if the value of that field is some particular name a relationship should be created which relates the Item with some other Item. WinFS rules can also access any external application. For example a rule can be built which launches a Notify application whenever a mail is received from a particular contact. WinFS rules can also be used to add new properties fields to existing data Items.

WinFS rules are also exposed as .NET CLR objects. As such any rule can be used for any other purposes. They can be even extended by inheriting them to form a new rule which consists of the condition and action of the parent rule plus something more or new.

Even though all data is shared everything is not equally accessible. WinFS uses Microsoft Windows authentication system to provide two data protection mechanisms. First there is share level security that controls access to the WinFS share. Second there is item level security that supports Microsoft Windows NT compatible security descriptors. The process accessing the item must have enough privileges to access it. Also in Microsoft Windows Vista there is the concept of integrity level for an application. A higher integrity data cannot be accessed by a lower integrity process.

The primary mode of data retrieval from a WinFS store is searching for the required data and enumerating through the set of Items that has been returned. WinFS also supports retrieval of the entire collection of Items that is stored in the WinFS store or returning a subset of it which matches the criteria that has been queried for.

WinFS makes all data available as CLR objects. So the data retrieved which is encapsulated as an object has intrinsic awareness of itself. By using the abstraction provided by use of objects it presents a uniform interface to hide its physical layout and still allow applications to retrieve the data in an application independent format or to get information about the data such as its author type and its relations.

For each Item that has been returned WinFS can also return a set of Relations which specify the Relations the Item is involved in. WinFS can return all the relations of the Item or can return Relations that conform to a queried criterion. For each pair or Item and Relation WinFS can retrieve the Item which forms the other end of the Relation. Thus by traversing the Relations of an Item all the Items that are related with the Item can be retrieved.

WinFS application programming interface API provides a class called the ItemContext class which is used to query for and update WinFS Items. The criterion for the query is expressed using an ESQL Entity SQL query string which is derived from Transact SQL TSQL and extends it with additional support for rich types collections and objects. As an example the following query will return a collection of messages located in a folder given the folder s ItemId itemId and that has a Title that starts with a specified string 

The above statement is very similar to a transact SQL statement with the addition of a new operator of Type. Joins order by group by aggregate functions nested queries can also be used in ESQL. ESQL however does not provide 100 compatibility with TSQL.

An ESQL query can specify a single search condition or a compound condition ESQL queries can also be used with relations to find related data.

WinFS is about sharing data. It allows easy sharing of data between applications. Not just that there is provision to share data among multiple WinFS stores as well which might reside in different computers by copying to and from them. A WinFS item can also be copied to a non WinFS file system but unless that data item is put back into WinFS store it won t support the advanced services provided by WinFS.

WinFS API also provides some support for sharing with non WinFS applications. WinFS exposes a shell object to access WinFS stores. This object which maps the WinFS items to a virtual folder hierarchy can be accessed by any application. Non WinFS file formats can be stored in WinFS stores as well using the File Item provided by WinFS. Importers can be written which convert specific file formats to WinFS Item types.

WinFS data can also be manually shared using network shares by sharing the legacy shell object. In addition WinFS provides synchronization services to automatically synchronize Items in two or more WinFS stores subject to some predefined condition such as share only photos or share photos which have an associated contact. The stores may be in the same computer or on different computers. Synchronization is done in a peer to peer mode eliminating the need to any central authority to manage the synchronization. Whenever a synchronization which can be either manual or automatic or scheduled is initiated WinFS enumerates the changes i.e. it finds out which Items are new or changes and therefore in need of synchronization and then update accordingly. If two or more changes are conflicting WinFS can either resort to automatic resolution of the conflict based on predefined rules or can defer them for manual resolution. WinFS also updates the schemas if required.

Extracting Microsoft Windows Vista operating system i.e. Windows or Windows Vista search properties from WinFS data is important to allow WinFS applications to search and categorize data in WinFS. Applications that are WinFS type agnostic can just operate on these search properties rather than operating on the individual types. Since these properties are stored in Windows Desktop Search WDS store as well it allows non WinFS applications written against WDS application programming interfaces APIs to also view search properties from WinFS data.

Also the WinFS independent software vendors ISVs can pick the metadata search properties for their types without compromising their item schema design. The ISVs specify mappings between WinFS types and the Windows search properties. These mappings can be specified by a type designer as schema files. For file stream contents in file items WinFS leverages the Property handlers registered with the Windows property system and extract appropriate search properties.

Referring next to shown is a block diagram illustrating as an example the alignment of WinFS content in WDS to accomplish the above objectives. As shown WinFS notifies WDS about WinFS item changes. Then the Protocol Handler is invoked by WDS . Search properties for the item are then extracted and stored in WinFS Store and WDS property store using the WDS components. Properties of WinFS items can then be used in Windows Vista search and in organization capabilities similar to any other content in Windows Vista. WinFS items are full text indexed using the Windows Search indexer . Indexes for WinFS items are stored in the common index catalog defined as part of the WDS . Full text queries in Windows platform return WinFS items alongside other non WinFS content.

WinFS API surface programs against search properties associated with an item . This includes querying for these properties and allows updates to these properties . The WinFS API query syntax allows making use of WDS full text query operations. Full text queries through the WinFS API are also satisfied by the common index catalog maintained by WDS. The WinFS Shell Namespace Extension WinFS SNE handles generic shell operations over WinFS items like double click bindings icons thumbnails etc. WinFS SNE allows updates of search properties of WinFS Items using the WinFS API . Out of the box WinFS schemas accommodate search property mapping definitions and corresponding schema types.

As shown above rich structured data in WinFS is mapped into a set of Windows search properties which is a flat list. These properties are stored both in the WDS Store i.e. WDS property store and in the WinFS Store . This is applicable not only to WinFS but any rich structured data that should be mapped into Windows search properties .

A mapping language is used for mapping search properties from rich structured data types declared as part of a WinFS type schema. For example this mapping language uses a query language for operating on entities in WinFS. The mapping is specified in a separate file from the schema definition using an XML syntax. Windows search properties can be defined in terms of schematized properties with simple functions over them such as WindowsSearchName Contact.FirstName Contact.LastName. Referring next to shown is an example of such XML code for search property mappings.

In addition if the type designer desires these search properties to be updateable he she to provides C code for doing the reverse mapping from search properties to the appropriate native type properties. This reverse mapping indicates that when the user changes the value of search property through WinFS API this supplied C code will be invoked to change the appropriate native type properties.

The process involved in defining and compiling these mappings is as follows. For defining the mappings at build time the type designer defines his her types in the schema and generates the client C classes using the normal schema install mechanism. The type designer or a separate mapping designer defines the Object Structured Query Language ESQL mapping expressions from the WinFS type properties to the Windows search properties. These mappings are provided in a separate mapping file see . This file is also compiled through WinFS APIG to generate C classes. C classes are compiled to generate the client assembly.

The mapping file using specific schema definition language XML constructs can contain the ESQL mapping form multiple types from many different schemas. ESQL Mapping and Update code for search properties are defined on Item and should be defined implemented on Item. The ESQL expression can refer to Links and Fragments for types defined in the same schema or schemas being referenced through a using clause in the schema file where Item is defined. The mappings are installed in an assembly. If an assembly contained mappings for more than one item type one would still install all the mappings in that assembly.

A content index type definition language is used for defining content indexable properties i.e. creating a content index specification in rich structured data types declared as part of the WinFS type schema. These properties can then be used by WinFS applications for performing content index or full text searches. The schema designer annotates the WinFS type properties in the schema by marking them for content indexing using the type definition language. Referring next to provided is an example of such annotation in a schema using the content index type definition language. Properties in Items Fragments Complex and Item Reference types can be marked for indexing. In addition content indexes can be declared across Item type hierarchies.

The content index definition for a given type is defined in the schema where the type is defined. When the schema is installed the full text index specification is processed by the full text schema handling component of the installer. During the processing SQL statements are generated that extract the value of the properties specified for full text indexing. These statements are generated for each type of entity in the schema and stored in an internal table.

If an Item Fragment Item Reference etc are added independently in another schema then during the installation of that schema the SQL for the item type where the Item Fragment Item Reference etc will be added is modified to include extraction of the that Item Fragment Item Reference etc. Note that at the instance level if there is no instance of the corresponding Item Fragment ComplexType Item Reference etc then the query will return no data which will be filtered out before returning to the application.

When a schema is uninstalled the SQL generated from the content index declarations for the Types in the schema being uninstalled are removed. Since the content indexes for a Type must be declared in the same schema as the one where the indexed top level Item Type is defined it is possible to uninstall all the content indexes defined for an Item and it s sub entity Type when the Type is uninstalled i.e. the schema is uninstalled .

Since a schema is uninstalled when there are no instances of the Types defined in that schema there is no need to do any re indexing of items when a schema is uninstalled.

The ContentIndex element is used to declare a content index on WinFS properties. A content index can be declared on the properties of Item or Item Reference type. It can also be declared on properties of a Complex type or Fragment type when this Compels or Fragment type gets used inside an Item or Fragment type through a Composition for the latter. A ContentIndex element contains zero or more ContentIndexField declarations or zero or more ContentIndexInlineField or zero or more ContentIndexComposition declarations.

The ContentIndexField element specifies a scalar property that is to be content indexed. This is used to specify content index on top level Item properties Complex type properties and Fragment properties.

Now if a new sub type of the Address Complex Type called USAddress is added that defines a property called Zip a content index can be defined on the zip field of those instances of Person.HomeAddresses that are of Type USAddress.

The ContentIndexComposition element is a used as a container to declare content index on WinFS fragment properties where the fragment is the target End type of this composition. This element can contain only one ContentIndexFragment element which corresponds to the target End type of the composition.

An infrastructure is provided for installing the content index definitions in the WinFS Store during schema installation. This includes parsing the content index definitions in the schema generation of appropriate SQL statements for data extraction and storing the SQL statements and associated metadata in the WinFS Store. Referring next to shown is a diagram illustrating such installation of the schema as described above. The SQL statements generated as result of installation of schema defining types and content index definitions are stored in the WinFS Store .
