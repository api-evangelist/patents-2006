Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119 the benefit of priority from provisional application 60 709 835 with a filing date of Aug. 18 2005 is claimed for this non provisional application.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

Radar is frequently used for search and rescue SAR operations. The microwave frequencies employed for radar typically range between 100 MHz wavelength of 10 m and 100 GHz of 1 mm that straddles across the overlapping radio and thermal infrared frequency bands. Because humans inherently lack organic senses for microwave energy frequencies an individual being sought cannot determine unaided whether sufficient the radar illumination has enabled successful detection.

Current radar detection systems typically employ a single antenna for each band of interest. These systems are typically large heavy specially tailored to aviation or maritime applications and may require dedicated power sources special cooling and the like. Such systems may incorporate multiple antennas and modulators tuned to the search frequency bands thereby increasing weight and volume further compromising portability for human transport.

Various embodiments are described relating to portable antenna device for radar detection. An example embodiment provides multiple antennas with each antenna tuned to a specific radar frequency.

According to an example embodiment a multi band radar detection device includes a plurality of antennas on a flexible substrate a detection and control circuit an indicator and a power source. The antenna may include one or more planar lithographic antennas that may be fabricated on a thin film substrate. Each antenna may be tuned to a different frequency or band.

A detector may be integrated into the antenna structure using a bolometer material. Each antenna may receive radiant energy at a particular frequency or band such as for radar. The detection and control circuit may discriminate between the signals received at different frequencies or bands and may activate one or more corresponding indicators.

According to an example embodiment a frequency selective surface FSS may be used to detect signals in the radar range e.g. 1 50 GHz to facilitate filtering of radar signals at different frequencies or bands. One or more antenna arrays may include FSS components as antenna elements. Each antenna array may have a particular geometry and size to be tuned to a specific frequency or band to allow the detection of radar signals at different signals.

Referring to the Figures in which like numerals indicate like elements is a diagram illustrating a multi band radar detection system according to an example embodiment. Multi band radar detection device may include a plurality of antennas such as co planar antennas and for collecting or receiving electromagnetic energy from separate frequencies.

The antennas may be disposed on a surface of a flexible electrically resistive substrate . As shown the antenna may form a periphery around or encompass a region that overlaps the antenna . In an alternative arrangement the antennas may cover separate non overlapping regions on the substrate .

Alternatively a radar detection system as contemplated may incorporate a single antennae . The antennas may be printed or lithographed in patterned arrays as an electrically conductive film e.g. metal onto the surface of the substrate . Kapton polyimide film from DuPont represents an exemplary material for the flexible substrate which electrically insulates the antennas .

A detection and control circuit may be coupled to the antennas to perform detection and overall control. The circuit typically requires an amplifier. The detection and control circuit receives signals from each antenna e.g. from antennas . Upon reception of radar signals of a particular frequency by the corresponding antenna or the detection and control circuit may detect these radar signals.

For example if the antenna is tuned e.g. based on size and geometry of antenna or antenna elements to frequency fand the antenna is tuned to frequency f the detection and control circuit may detect radar signals at frequency fbased on signals from the antenna and may detect radar signals at frequency fbased on signals from the antenna .

The detection and control circuit may activate one or more of indicators in response to detecting radar signals at particular frequencies e.g. based on signals received from the antennas . The indicators may include an audio indicator such as a speaker or other device to provide an audio output e.g. different audible tone or other audio signal for each detected frequency . The indicators may also be a visual indicator such as a different color light emitting diode LED for each frequency or a tactile or physical indication e.g. human sensible vibration or pulse .

A battery or other electrical power source provides electrical power to the various circuits and components of multi band radar detection device . The battery may be a small battery with a low aspect ratio such as a button battery for a watch. The battery may provide a trickle charge for a fast response capacitor connected to the circuit .

Although search radars impart energy to the environment the incident power density funneled to the antennas at typical operational ranges cannot supply sufficient energy to activate the circuit and the indicators absent a supplemental power source. For a passive system a fast response capacitor may charge the tag from energy collected by a large array of antennas.

One or more signalers e.g. audio visual or tactile or physical signal generators such as indicators are coupled to detection and control circuit . Small conductive wire traces on the substrate similar to connections used in integrated circuit boards may be used to couple the circuit and the associated components. These traces may be coated with plastic epoxy for their protection from environmental conditions.

The indicators may be directly associated with their corresponding antennas to identify the particular frequency detected. Alternatively the indicators may represent a collective set of alarms in sundry media e.g. visible audio tactile corresponding to detection in any of the frequencies received by the antennas .

The circuit may incorporate functions of a readout integrated circuit ROIC particularly for indicators that exhibit an alpha numeric display. In exemplary embodiments however the indicators provide a simple on or off signal to minimize control logic and power.

The device may preferably be contained within the dimensions of a typical business card 78 mm 45 mm or service personnel flag patch 67 mm 45 mm . For operational radar detection in the search and rescue application the Ka band between 33.4 GHz and 36.0 GHz particularly 34 GHz corresponding to a wavelength of 8.5 mm represents a preferable frequency regime. Thus antennas tuned to the Ka band may fit within a business card area without employing expensive fractal or meanderline antenna designs.

Alternatively other frequency ranges may be employed including microwave e.g. Bluetooth IEEE 802.15 at 2.402 2.480 GHz wavelength 0.125 m X band 10.475 10.575 GHz wavelength 30 mm K band 24.0 24.25 GHz wavelength 12.5 mm and millimeter long infrared THz bands. The antennas correspond to linear dimensions of about one wavelength.

Each of antennas may be tuned to be sensitive to a particular frequency or band due to their size and geometry or shape . Thus antennas may have different sizes and geometries so as to be tuned to different frequencies. This may allow the multi band radar detection device to detect radar signals at different frequencies or bands.

According to an example embodiment each of the antennas may include a coplanar array of antenna elements with each element of the array having a size and geometry tunable to a specific frequency or band. For example the first and second antennas may each include a coplanar array of a plurality of antenna elements with the elements having corresponding sizes and or geometries for tuning to first and second frequencies respectively. The example shown in illustrates only two antennas but any number of antennas or antenna arrays may be used within the inventive scope.

The incident electromagnetic radiation from radar will typically induce millimeter frequency current waves to flow in the arms of the antenna along the direction of the incident electric field. The induced current waves will propagate along the antenna arms producing voltage across the sensor material thereby enabling capture of the incident radiation. The antenna can be formed out of any appropriate conductive metal using standard planar lithography technologies.

The indicators may constitute different media to signal an alert or alternatively may operate in the same mode as the neighboring indicators for detection of separately defined frequencies. A different indication may be provided for detection of each different frequency e.g. lighting or flashing a different LED providing a different audio tone or providing a different tactile output.

For example a red LED may be lit in response to detecting radar signals at a first frequency a blue LED may be lit in response to detecting radar signals at a second frequency and a green LED may be lit in response to detecting radar signals at a third frequency.

These LED signals may provide the user with an indication of the frequency of radar signals that was detected multi band radar detection device . For example land based and airborne radar systems may employ distinct frequency bands. Therefore activating a different indicator in response to different radar frequencies may provide useful information to the user.

These antenna arrays do not interfere with e.g. defocus scatter signal reception of their neighboring layers due to the antennas being offset from each other within their arrays. In addition the antennas within their arrays are tuned their individually tuned frequencies. Johnson noise associated with infrared frequencies in smaller antennas does not affect the applications for these embodiments. Thus design constraints from ganged antenna elements and phased arrays may be obviated by avoiding direct antenna overlay.

Each of these stacked or overlapping antenna arrays may include elements having a size and geometry that are tuned to receive or be sensitive to a particular frequency. For example the array may include elements having a size and geometry that are tuned to frequency f. Likewise the array may be tuned to frequency f the array may be tuned to frequency f and the array may be tuned to frequency f. Similarly the arrays may each include elements being sized and shaped for tuning to their specific frequencies.

The antenna structure may integrate detection capability with radar signal reception by configuring the array as a bolometer or a micro bolometer. Each antenna may receive radiant energy at a particular frequency or within a band such as for radar.

The bolometer consists of a radiation sensitive resistance element in one branch of a Wheatstone bridge. Radiation that strikes the bolometer element changes its electrical resistance. This change is based on the design of the antenna and conductivity characteristics of its material thereby enabling detection of the received radar energy to be forwarded to the circuit .

For example the radiation sensitive bolometer element may be formed e.g. of a platinum strip a semiconductor film. The impedance of the bolometer design may be empirically derived by comparing rates of sputter deposition and resulting thickness while measuring the standing wave ratio of the antenna.

The antenna arrays may employ a wide range of thicknesses provided the material has low ohmic loss. Each antenna may form a spiral having an impedance of about 50 ohms within the bolometer patch. Preferably the antenna array structures would be on the order of 1 m with the bolometer being applied as a rectangular patch on the substrate. The bolometer thickness may depend on the sheet resistance of the substrate and match the impedance of the antenna.

Planar frequency selective surface FSS devices have been used in the infrared IR frequency range Terahertz or THz for thermal measurement applications. For example see Infrared Frequency Selective Surfaces Design Fabrication and Measurement by B. Monacelli J. B. Pryor B. A. Munk D. Kotter and G. D. Boreman v. 5406 B. F. Andresen G. B. Fulop eds. SPIE August 2004 pp. 879 886 for Apr. 12 16 2004 Infrared Technology and Applications XXX Conference.

An FSS also known as a dichroic surface consists of elements arranged in a planar periodic array to create a bandpass or bandstop filter for plane waves at any angles of incidence. These elements may form an array of patterned shapes e.g. cruciform hollow rectangle etc. and can be constructed as printed circuit elements on a dielectric substrate such as by lithographic techniques.

Each antenna may include an FSS layer for tuning to the selection frequency. Separate FSS layers may be superposed over each other to bandstop several different frequencies. FSS layers may be produced for radar frequency applications such as in the arrays and in various embodiments.

The bolometer may be made from temperature sensitive material. The resistance of the bolometer may change based on the radar signal received or collected by antenna element . An electrical signal output from the bolometer may therefore change based on the radar signals received or collected by the antenna element .

The spiral configuration for the bolometer in shows a three way element with all three paths connected by a conducting metal bridge as an exemplary embodiment. The leads of the bolometer may be connected to a detection circuit one for the signal and the other to ground. The bolometer can be electrically monitored as a balanced Wheatstone bridge circuit with the resistance of the bolometer as one leg of the bridge.

Excitation by microwave energy superimposes a current difference to the spiral antenna. The antenna arms conduct the current to measure the resulting change in current across the bolometer from the difference between a reference bias voltage and the microwave induced voltage. shows antenna array elements without bolometer elements incorporated.

In a conventional bolometer the surface of the absorber will typically be at least one square wavelength in area to efficiently receive radiation. This large area equates to a large thermal mass and slow response. This distribution results in marginal sensitivity and response times for burst radar detection applications but mitigates against burnout.

According to an example embodiment the disclosed antenna coupled micro bolometer technology may compensate for the limitations of bolometers. Radar energy may be focused by a lithographic antenna onto an absorber element micro bolometer that is typically several orders of magnitude smaller than a wavelength in size. This may result in a bolometer with small thermal mass and fast response characteristics.

In principle the radar radiation may be received by a macro antenna which is physically designed for operation in the desired frequency bands. When in the field of view the radar antenna receives the energy and goes into a resonance mode.

The excitation of the antenna by electromagnetic radiation induces current waves that propagate through the arms of the antenna. The antenna may be feed point coupled to a bolometer detector. The induced antenna current flows into the bolometer. The absorbed power causes a fast response temperature rise in the bolometer element providing real time response to radar.

For example if a known or substantially constant voltage is applied across the micro bolometer a change in the bolometer s resistance e.g. due to received radiant energy or radar signals will change the current output from micro bolometer . Similarly if a known or substantially constant current is passing through the bolometer any change in the resistance of micro bolometer will typically change the voltage drop across micro bolometer .

These changes in the electrical signals e.g. change in current or voltage output from each micro bolometer in the array may be determined by detection and control circuit . In this manner each antenna array which may have elements of a specific size and geometry tuned to a specific frequency may output electrical signals e.g. voltages or current to the detection and control circuit indicating the presence or absence of radar signal at the respective tuned frequencies. The detection and control circuit may then activate the appropriate indicators e.g. based on the received signals indicating whether radar energy or signals at particular frequencies have been detected.

According to an example embodiment the multi band radar detection device may be provided on a small area substrate which may be for example about 4 cm wide 6 cm long 0.5 cm thick . The antenna array s may be fabricated on a semiconductor substrate or as part of a semiconductor device. According to an example embodiment the multi band radar detection device may provide a small form factor a coplanar array of radar antennas with integrated power from e.g. battery logic e.g. detection and control circuit and alarm indication e.g. indicators .

The antennas may be tuned to specific bands or frequencies by their size and geometry for example. Each antenna may be tuned to a different frequency or band. Thus a single device is provided that is capable of detecting multi band radar signals. The device may be small light low power and man portable. Multiple antennas are provided in a coplanar array to sense multi band radar energy.

In an example embodiment each antenna may be provided as an array of elements. Each element may include for example an antenna element and either a bolometer or a micro bolometer. The use of multiple stacked antenna arrays may reduce angle of incidence limitations or provide gross bearing indication of incoming radar energy. Non coplanar conformal arrays that may function while attached to irregular or changing surfaces may also be used.

According to an example embodiment multi band radar detection device may detect radar signals or radiant energy in the range of 1 GHz 50 GHz. In another embodiment multi band radar detection device may also detect radar signals or radiant energy in the range of 10 GHz 30 GHz. These are examples and the present disclosure is not limited thereto.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
