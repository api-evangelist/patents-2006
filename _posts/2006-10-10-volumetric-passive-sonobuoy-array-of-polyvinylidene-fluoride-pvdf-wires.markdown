This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 727 382 filed Oct. 17 2005 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention is made with Government support under NAVSEA Contract No. N00024 03 D 6606 awarded by the U.S. Navy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to a hydrophone array particularly hydrophone arrays for underwater acoustic sensing of subsurface marine vehicles.

Undersea noise is well known to be highly dynamic and anisotropic. Surface generated noise undergoes multipath propagation in the ocean waveguide arriving at the receiver at a distribution of elevation angles. Discrete noise contributions from anthropogenic and biologic sources add acute directionally in azimuth and elevation. Shallow water bathymetry also contributes by varying the distribution of the noise field across azimuth. Such anisotropy in the noise field may be exploited to increase the detection range of a passive sonar array. However detection performance can be severely affected by nearby shipping noise through the array s beam response sidelobes.

The detection performance of low frequency passive sonars may be severely affected if deployed under heavy shipping conditions. Merchant ships tankers and other anthropogenic undersea acoustic sources are very loud and they may affect detection performance even at long distances from the receiver. However energy from the distant ships which drops by about 6 dB octave in source level with increasing frequency undergoes water column absorption and multiple bottom interactions while the energy from a nearby quiet signal will be less attenuated due to its shorter range. Therefore at higher frequencies clutter from distant shipping noise is expected to decrease more rapidly than the received energy level of the target. In addition high frequency arrays are much smaller which reduces cost and makes them attractive components of unmanned vehicles and expendable systems.

There is yet need for array designs and signal processing approaches to satisfy a number of requirements a high frequency passive sonar to mitigate clutter from shipping noise. The sonar system should be easy to deploy and the number of array elements should be minimized to reduce data rate and processor demand. To maximize the detection range of the system a new design must feature a vertical aperture to exploit the ambient noise anisotropy. In addition the system must be inexpensive for use as expendable units for multiple uses such as adjuncts to ocean observatories deployable from air or surface platforms.

A sonar system for detecting underwater acoustic signals is provided herein the sonar system comprising a a plurality of hydrophone units capable of converting acoustic impulses to electrical signals said hydrophone units being substantially vertically oriented when deployed in a body of water and said hydrophone units occupying at least some of the positions of an N M horizontal array wherein N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns in the array b means for applying a two dimensional Chebyshev mathematical weighting to the electrical signals from the individual hydrophone units such that each individual signal from each hydrophone unit is assigned a respective weighting number and a numerical value is assigned to each individual signal corresponding to the strength of the electrical signal as adjusted by the respective weighting number and c means for deploying said hydrophone units in the body of water.

The sonar system advantageously reduces beam side lobes which cause confusion of the acoustic signals and hamper accurate detection and directional localization of target marine vessels. Moreover microprocessor demand is minimized.

Referring now to the hydrophone array deployment system includes a float battery tether line electronics package array support hydrophone array and optionally weight loaded into a sonobuoy canister . The sonobuoy canister can be size A or smaller.

Referring also now to the system is shown deployed in a body of water . Deployment can be accomplished by for example dropping system into the water by airplane surface vessel or any other suitable means. Jettison of the contents of the sonobuoy canister can be accomplished by various means such as the impact of the sonobuoy into the water. Alternatively a battery e.g. seawater activated battery can power the ejection of the contents by for example firing a squib. Also back plate can be jettisoned by water impact firing a squib etc. to allow the hydrophone array to descend to the proper depth. Float remains at the surface of the body of water and preferably includes a transmitter with antenna and the appropriate battery powered electronics for converting the electrical signals from the hydrophones into radio waves for wireless transmission to a remote receiver. The transmitter is preferably powered by battery . Tether allows the hydrophone array to descend to a predetermined depth. Tether can typically range up to 250 feet in length for example. Electronics package increases the power of the electrical signal from the hydrophones for transmission to the transmitter and also includes a microprocessor for converting analog to digital signals and performing the calculations described below. Electronic package can also include a compass to facilitate geographic orientation of the hydrophone array . Weight can optionally be included to facilitate deployment of the hydrophone array . Support system includes two to four rigid connecting rods to maintain the hydrophone array in a fixed orientation with respect to the electronics package .

The system is passive. Active sonobuoy systems emit acoustic signals into the water and listen for the return echo. Passive systems merely listen for sounds made by underwater craft e.g. power plant propellers door closings or other mechanically generated or human generated noise.

Referring now to the hydrophone array includes a plurality of hydrophone units arranged parallel to each other in an array which is embedded in a polymeric encapsulant material . The hydrophones are sized and spaced for specific target frequencies e.g. 25 kHz 20 kHz 15 kHz. The hydrophones are vertically oriented when fully deployed. The polymeric encapsulant is preferably an acoustically transparent polyurethane i.e. having the same acoustic impedance as seawater rho c material . Polyurethane encapsulants suitable for use in the invention are commercially available from BF Goodrich Co. and other suppliers.

Referring now to hydrophone units are deployed in an N M array wherein N and M are the number of rows and columns respectively of positions for hydrophones in a rectangular grid. The distance between adjacent hydrophone units within a row or column is the same. N and M can be the same or different whole numbers and preferably each range from 6 to 10 more preferably 6 to 8 and most preferably 6 or 7. The more hydrophones in the grid the more accurate determination of the direction of the received acoustic signals. However the more space is needed in the sonobuoy canister to store the array. In a preferred embodiment shown in a nominal 6 6 grid is altered by leaving the corner positions vacant. The reason for this modification is explained below.

Various types of acoustic transducers can be used to detect acoustic waves transmitted through the water. For example the acoustic transducer can comprise a tube formed at least in part of a piezo material. Piezo materials can be piezoelectric which generate an electrical pulse or current upon receiving a mechanical impulse such as from an acoustic vibration or piezoresistive which change resistance upon receiving a mechanical impulse. Piezoelectric material can comprise an active polarized ceramic material such as barium titanate or lead zirconate titanate PZT . The piezoelectric material can in another embodiment be a piezoelectric polymer material such as polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF or a piezo rubber composite material. Piezoresistive materials include for example conductive elastomeric polymeric foams or rubbers which become more conductive when compressed.

Typically hydrophones include a central or core conductor an outer conductor and a layer of piezo material disposed between and in contact with the core conductor and outer conductor in a coaxial configuration. When subjected to mechanical force the piezo material such as polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF generates an electrical current which is carried by the conductors. Hydrophone units typically have a diameter of from about 1 10 inch to about inch. Hydrophone units suitable for use in the invention are known and commercially available for example from Argotech Inc. of Fort Lauderdale Fla.

The system is deployed for example by launch from an airplane. When the sonobuoy enters the water the contents of the sonobuoy are ejected from the canister. The float remains on the water surface and the deployable array drops to a predetermined depth.

A problem associated with sonar detection using such arrays is the presence of side lobes where partial constructive interference of incoming acoustic waves takes place. The side lobes cause confusion of the signals and it is desirable to suppress the side lobes.

Shading the conventional beamformer of an array can suppress the sidelobe levels. There is a vast variety of line array one dimensional shading functions such as Hanning Hamming Blackman Chebyshev Gaussian Kaiser Bartlett Hann Nuttall Blackman Harris modified Bartlett Hanning Tukey Bohman Parsen and of course uniform weighting to name a few. A significant feature of the present invention is the application of two dimensional 2 D Chebyshev weighting. Full azimuthal coverage without ambiguity may be achieved by applying 2 D Chebyshev weighting to a grid patterned array of vertical PVDF wires. The advantage of Chebyshev shading is that it offers the ability to control all sidelobes to any desired peak level.

A 2 D gridded array designed for 5 kHz must have an element spacing of half a wavelength at about 7 kHz to mitigate a backlobe ambiguity. In addition the minimum array size is 6 6 hydrophone units. A smaller array results in the appearance of a backlobe that can t be mitigated with further reduction of hydrophone unit spacing. Applying 2 D Chebyshev weighting to this 6 6 array results in heavily shaded corners that hardly contribute to the array s performance. For example the corner hydrophone units are shaded to 4 the value of any of the four center elements of a 6 6 array Chebyshev shaded to reduce the sidelobes to 40 dB below the level at the maximum response axis. Therefore the corner hydrophone units may be omitted from the array to reduce the total number of hydrophone units to 32 in a trimmed grid array. Elimination of the corner units reduces the computational demand upon the microprocessor. At much lower frequencies shaded beamforming would result in an omnidirectional beam pattern with no gain against noise. Instead this array may be processes as a gradient sensor to form a cardioid beam pattern in azimuth to maintain a non zero array gain.

The 6 6 trimmed grid array consists of 32 elements hydrophone units collecting time variability of the received pressure field. Fast Fourier Transform FFT of the element level time series results in the spectral content of the pressure field p across the selected processing time FFT 1 where n is the element number from 1 to N 32 p is the dynamic pressure which is a function of time t and angular frequency . A polynomial fit is applied to obtain a simple expression to estimate the flop count of each Fast Fourier Transform FFT . The number of flops can be estimated using the flops command of Matlab version 5.2 .

Since the conventional beam array CBF beamwidth of the 2 D Chebyshev shaded 6 6 grid array is 33 degrees the number of CBF beams is about 11. However the beamwidth of an adaptive beamformer is much thinner and the number of beams will definitely increase for complete coverage. Each ABF beam is steered to exp cos cos sin cos sin where x y z are the coordinates of each array element k is the wavenumber and are the beam steering directions in azimuth and elevation respectively. In the case of the array of vertical wire elements the elevation is fixed to 0. The minimum variance distortionless response MVDR beamformer weights with a white noise gain constraint are given by the elements of 

The ABF beam spectra are given by 6 where an inverse FFT is applied to generate ABF beam space time series.

If the noise field is cluttered with a non stationary component caused by a dynamic shipping population the fastest and nearest ships relative to the array may cross from one narrow ABF beam to others during the integration time required to estimate the full rank element level covariance matrix. If the ships are not moving their energy may be suppressed with just one eigenvalue per ship. However a moving ship that crosses from beam to beam over the integration time will require more than just one eigenvalue for complete suppression.

To address this problem reduced rank adaptive beamforming was introduced. It consists of selection of the 1

where the steering vector is given by exp cos cos sin cos sin 8 and m represents the beam number from 1 to M. The weights w of the 6 6 trimmed grid array are given by 2 D version of the Chebyshev weights of a line array with 40 dB sidelobe levels 

More generally however for any size matrix wis the inner product of the linear Chebyshev weights in both coordinates w cheb N 1 cheb 1 M 

It can be seen from the array of weights wset forth in formula 9 above the weights of the corner positions 0.04 are relatively low with respect to the other. Hence these corner positions of the 6 6 array need not be occupied by hydrophones. The elimination of the corner hydrophones reduces the number of required hydrophones from 36 to 32 with little loss of accuracy thereby saving valuable space so as to allow the array to be packed within a size A sonobuoy canister. Moreover the shaded beamforming described above with reduced number of hydrophone units reduces the computational demand on the microprocessor.

The final 6 6 grid array configuration is illustrated in . The on axis sidelobes are reduced to 40 dB. The sidelobes along elevation from the main lobe can t be suppressed through shading because the length of the vertical wires is uniform in thickness and sensitivity. These sidelobes could potentially limit the array s ability to fully exploit the vertical noise anisotropy. However they do not degrade the array s ability to mitigate the nearby ship interference through the sidelobes.

Conventional computer control systems can be used to process the electrical signals from hydrophones using the 2D Chebyshev weighting. Referring to electrical signals S from the hydrophone units are sent to a microprocessor M which applies 2 D Chebyshev weighting C to the individual hydrophone signals as described above the strength of each signal being adjusted by the corresponding weighting value wto produce weighted signals W. Microprocessor M performs the beamforming computations of formula 11 above to provide accurate directional information regarding for example submarine vessels.

While the above description contains many specifics these specifics should not be construed as limitations of the invention but merely as exemplifications of preferred embodiments thereof. For example while the invention herein is particularly advantageous for military applications and has been described in terms of detection of submarines it can clearly be employed in any situation wherein acoustic detection is needed such as oceanographic or other scientific studies rescue operations and the like. Those skilled in the art will envision many other embodiments within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the claims appended hereto.
