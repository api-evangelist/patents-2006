The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to mortar munitions and in particular to breech loaded mortar munitions.

In the past mortars have been muzzle loaded. With muzzle loaded mortars the position of the mortar bomb in the mortar tube is not an issue. In a breech loaded mortar the mortar bomb may be loaded by a mechanical auto loader. The bomb is placed forward of the correct firing position to insure that the bomb is not struck by the breech block as it is closed. After the breech block is closed the bomb must be moved back against the breech block. When the mortar tube is in an elevated position gravity will move the bomb back against the breech block. When the mortar tube is horizontal or nearly horizontal the force of gravity is not sufficient to move the bomb back against the breech block. Thus there is a need for a device to move mortar bombs back against the breech block when the mortar tube is horizontal or nearly horizontal.

A primary object of the invention is to provide an apparatus to move a breech loaded mortar bomb back against the breech block when the mortar tube is horizontal or nearly horizontal.

One aspect of the invention is a mortar munition comprising a mortar tube an opening in the wall of the mortar tube a spring loaded valve assembly disposed in the opening in the wall of the mortar tube and a solenoid having a plunger the plunger being disposed to open the spring loaded valve assembly. A vacuum source is connected to the spring loaded valve assembly. The

solenoid is attached to a recoilless mass. A fire control computer is electrically connected to the solenoid.

The spring loaded valve assembly comprises a valve disposed in a housing the housing being disposed in the opening in the wall of the mortar tube a valve cap on one end of the valve the valve cap for interacting with the solenoid plunger and a compression spring disposed around the valve for keeping the valve normally closed. A vacuum connection is rotatably attached to the housing.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Referring to one embodiment of a mortar munition in accordance with the invention includes a mortar tube having an opening in its wall. A spring loaded valve assembly is disposed in the opening in the wall of the mortar tube . A solenoid includes a plunger that is disposed adjacent the spring loaded valve assembly . The plunger is operable to open the spring loaded valve assembly . A vacuum source is connected to the spring loaded valve assembly via a vacuum line and vacuum connection .

The munition includes a recoilless mass . The recoilless mass may be any part of the munition that does not recoil when the mortar bomb is fired and is suitable for supporting the solenoid . Solenoid is mounted to the recoilless mass . A fire control computer is electrically connected to the solenoid . Computer determines when plunger will open the spring loaded valve assembly .

Referring to the spring loaded valve assembly comprises a valve disposed in a housing . The housing is disposed in the opening in the wall of the mortar tube . One end of the valve includes a valve cap that interacts with the solenoid plunger . A compression spring is disposed around the valve for keeping the valve normally closed. A vacuum connection is attached to the housing . The vacuum connection is preferably rotatable around the housing . To this end O rings seal the vacuum connection to the housing . The rotatable vacuum connection is desirable so that the vacuum line may be connected to the assembly in any orientation.

In operation the mortar bomb is loaded into the mortar tube and the breech is closed. The mortar bomb is pushed forward of the correct firing position so that the breech will not strike the bomb when the breech is closed. When the fire control computer senses that the breech is closed a signal is sent to solenoid and plunger pushes on valve cap to open valve . When valve is open vacuum source is fluidly connected to the space behind the maximum diameter portion of mortar bomb thereby pulling the bomb rearward to its correct firing position. The correct firing position is shown in . Plunger then retracts and compression spring forces valve to the normally closed position. The mortar munition may then be fired. During recoil the plunger is not in contact with the valve cap so that the assembly is free to recoil with the tube .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
