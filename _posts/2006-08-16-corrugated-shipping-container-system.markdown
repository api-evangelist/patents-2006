This application incorporates herein by reference as though recited in full the disclosures of patent application Ser. No. 10 979 138 filed Nov. 3 2004 having the title CORRUGATED SHIPPING CONTAINER SYSTEM and provisional patent application 60 516 700 filed Nov. 3 2003. This application claims the benefit of provisional patent application 60 708 663 filed Aug. 16 2005 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The invention relates to a shipping crate formed from sheets of corrugated material such as paper board and in particular to a crate whose design optimizes compression strength relative to the amount of material that is use to make the crate.

Shipping crates made from corrugated board are gaining popularity over wooden crates due to weight benefits as well as concerns of insects being carried in the wood. The crates are manufactured so that the flutes of the corrugated board are vertical because it is well known that the vertically orientation can support far more weight than horizontally oriented fluting. The compression strength or load bearing strength of corrugated board crates is then strengthened by adding additional corrugate layers and or by increasing the weight of the corrugated board that is used.

The need for high load bearing strength is based on the fact that crates are frequently stacked in storage and during shipment. Crates may be stacked two or three high and instances they can be stacked four high. The bottom crate must support the weight of all of the crates above it.

A cargo carrier is typically a metal shipping container and shipping crates are generally manufactured to have dimensions such as that in combination they will substantially fill the 8 8 40 ft. interior space the cargo carriers. The crates can be any combination of sizes that readily combine to fill the 8 8 40 foot interior. In those instances where the interior space of the cargo transporter is other than a standard 8 8 40 feet then the crate can be dimensioned to correspond to the interior dimension of the cargo transporter. Long distance shipping crates and particularly crates for international shipping of goods are predominantly designed to provide approximately an eight foot by eight foot by four foot interior space.

The container capacity is the total cubic volume cube a container can accommodate or the cubic measurement of cargo. The capacity i.e. the internal volume is determined by multiplying the internal dimensions that is the product of internal length width and height. The capacity may vary among containers of the same specified length and height.

The use of two or three layers of corrugated paper significantly increasing the crush strength. As the cost of the crate is directly related to the amount of corrugated paper that is used. the material cost of a double wall 1 300 pound paper would about two thirds the cost of a 1 300 pound triple wall corrugated paper.

A double wall corrugated has two outer layers of flat sheet material two layers of fluted sheets and a third layer of flat sheet material between the two fluted layers. A triple wall panel has two outer layers of flat sheet material three layers of fluted sheets and two layers of flat sheet material separating the three fluted layers. A triple wall panel thus has a flat sheet fluted sheet flat sheet fluted sheet flat sheet in that order. As the flat sheets use less material per running foot than a fluted sheet the triple wall has very nearly one third more material than a double wall which is reflected in the cost. The weight of the corrugated material will also be reflected in the price. Corrugated sheet that are classified as 1 000 weight would cost double that of 500 weight corrugated.

The compression resistance of crates can be tested by using r ASTM D4169 D642. Failure of crates tested under ASTM D4169 D642 occurs when the crate compresses to any extent. The tests are all run to failure and since the tests are run in twenty pounds increments the compression prior to failure that is the maximum compression strength is twenty pounds less than compression at failure.

The present invention relates to a crate having a base four sides and a top cap. A first panel and a second panel form the four sides. Each of the two panels has a first a second and a third sub panel. The first sub panel of the first panel is positioned to overlap or overly the third panel of the second panel. The second sub panel of the first panel and the second sub panel of the second panel have substantially identical dimensions the of the first panel and the first sub panel of the second panel have substantially identical dimensions and the third sub panel of the first panel and the third sub panel of the second panel have substantially identical dimensions. Preferably the first sub panel is less than one half the width of the third sub panel but at least twenty percent of the width of the third sub panel. Essentially the first panel and the second panel are interchangeable.

The upper and lower ends of the crate are enclosed with end caps and the base panel of at least double wall corrugated paper is positioned on the lower end cap. The lower or bottom end cap is positioned on the skid. The base panel has peripheral dimensions that are substantially equal to the interior dimensions of the crate. Thus the first and second panels are held between the base panel and the lower end cap.

The crate is used in combination with a skid for shipping cargo. The cargo can be a plurality of items that are individually packaged or wrapped with a cushioning material or a combination thereof.

Surprisingly it has now been found that a crate made from an outer shell of vertically fluted corrugated board in combination with horizontally oriented inner panels can provide greater compression strength than its vertical vertical counter part. As for example a 1100 weight triple wall layer in combination with a 500 weight double layer has a higher compression resistance than same size crates formed from two layers of 1300 weight triple wall.

It has also be found that using the disclosed system a crate made from the combination of 1100 weight triple wall outer layer and an inner layer of 500 weight double layer has a higher compression resistance than same size crates formed from the combination of a layer of 1300 triple wall and a 500 inner layer.

It is extremely surprising that a 1300 1300 crate combined weight of 2600 has a compression rating in pounds of 12940 while a 1100 500 1100 combined weight of 2700 has a compression rating of 22 690. The compression rating is in accordance with Military approved testing standard ASTM D4169 D642.

In one broad aspect of the disclosure a shipping crate is formed from an eleven hundred or less outer layer in combination with an eleven hundred or less inner layer.

In another broad aspect of the disclosure a shipping crate is made from an outer layer of double wall or triple wall in combination with a double or triple wall inner layer. The flutes in the outer layer run vertically while the flutes in the inner layer run horizontally.

In another broad aspect of the disclosure a shipping crate is made from two outer panels each panel having a U configuration. That is each panel has two outer subpanels and a sub panel contiguously between the two outer panels. The panels are in essence mirror images of each other. The outer sub panels on one panel overly One of the outer panel layers of double wall or triple wall vertically oriented corrugated in combination with a double wall horizontally oriented corrugated inner layer.

It is advantageous to define several terms before describing the invention. It should be appreciated that the following definitions are used throughout this application.

Where the definition of terms departs from the commonly used meaning of the term applicant intends to utilize the definitions provided herein unless specifically indicated otherwise.

As employed herein the term corrugate paper and the term corrugated board are used interchangeably and are inclusive of single double and triple wall corrugated materials for shipping crates as well known in the art.

As employed herein the term crate refers to an enclosure of any size or shape formed from a base an end cap and a pair of panels. Typically the base is a second end cap. A crate formed from two end caps and two J panels or two U panels.

As employed herein the term overlap refers to the side by side arrangement of a panel or sub panel of a wall of a crate and a sub panel or panel of another wall of a crate. The term overlap is used interchangeably with the term superjacent meaning to lie over upon or overlying. shows end panels of walls and superjacent with each other.

As employed herein the term J panel refers to a panel having at least one corner turn that is an L shaped corner. The term is inclusive of a panel having two corner turns in the form of a J or a which for simplicity is referred to as a U . An inner subpanel is preferably longer than the other two panels but the two arms of the U can be the long sides of a crate. Fold lines separate the three subpanels and the two outer sub panels are contiguous with the inner one or two sub panels. A J crate can have two outer panels of unequal dimensions. Depending upon the dimensions of a crate the base of the J can be the longer of the sidewalls of a crate. In a four foot crate there may be three panels of roughly the same length.

As employed herein the term scored when used with respect to corrugated panels is inclusive of an elongated crushing of the corrugated material to form a region about which subpanels can be folded to form an L a U or a J shaped configuration.

As employed herein the term contiguous refers to components that have been constructed integrally with an adjacent component as for example the subpanels of a panel having multiple parts. Contiguous subpanels are separated by score lines that facilitate the forming of corner folds and folds for storage and or shipping of corrugated board to an assembly facility.

As employed herein the term single wall refers to corrugated material that has one corrugated layer and two outer flats sheets.

As employed herein the term double wall refers to corrugated material that has two corrugated layers separated by a flat sheet and two outer flats sheets.

As employed herein the term triple wall refers to corrugated material that has three corrugated layers with each layer being separated by a flat sheet and two outer flats sheets thus providing four flat sheets and three corrugated sheets.

As employed herein the designation of 1 300 weight paper indicates that 1 000 square feet of the paper from which the flutes are made and weighs 1 300 pounds. Similarly the designation 1 100 indicates that 1000 square feet of the sheet material weighs that 1 100 pounds. It is noted that by way of contrast the weight of Kraft paper is based on paper weight per 3 000 square feet.

As employed herein the term flute refers to the layer of corrugated board that typically is used with two outer layers of flat sheets.

The invention relates to the design and manufacturing of cross core panel crates and a system of shipping these crates as folded corrugated panels preferably on a skid prior to assembly. The disclosed crates provide higher crush resistance than prior art crates at a lighter weight.

As seen in the second panel R forming the crate is illustrated. In most embodiments the first panel and second panel R are identical however it could be seen in some embodiments where irregular crates are required that the two panels could be dimensioned differently. The corresponding designations for the sub panels in on the interior surface R are R R R and R. Score line R separates the contiguous sub panels R and R score line R separates contiguous sub panels R and R and score line R separates sub panels R and R. As with the first sub panel three of the four sub panels R R and R have horizontally fluted panels R R and R respectively adhered at approximately the middle. It should be noted that the configuration of the horizontally fluted panels and R R R in are actually identical. When the wall forming panel indicated generally by arrow in is rotated 180 degrees it is identical to wall forming panel R of . Accordingly pair of the panels and R is used to form a crate such as illustrated in .

In panel is illustrated in the folded position. As can be seen the fluted panels and face the interior of the crate. Sub panel is folded at score line to form one end of the crate. Score line is not folded once the panel is being assembled into a crate and is only used for the shipping process that is described further hereinafter. Sub panel is folded at score line to form the overlap end to the crate.

Glue or any other convenient bonding agent adheres the horizontal fluted panels to the wall panels and R. Similarly glue or any other bonding agent adheres horizontal fluted panels R R and R to the wall panel R. Additionally glue or any other convenient bonding agent is used to adhere the overlap panel to the sub panel R and the overlap panel R to the sub panel . The method of adhering the horizontal fluted panels to a wall panel and the overlap panels to the wall panels is not narrowly critical. One skilled in the art can use any convenient method of securing the horizontal sub panels to a wall panel.

While triple wall corrugated paper is a preferred material for the wall panels such as and R double wall corrugated board can also be used.

Once the panels and R are assembled the crate is completed as illustrated in . The crate shows the panel overlapped by overlap panel R with the opposing end not shown having panel overlapped by overlap panel . As can also be seen here the score lines and are folded while center score line remains unfolded. The base or lower lid is dimensioned to receive the assembled panels and R and provide the required lateral rigidity. Additional rigidity is provided by the top . In most embodiments the crate will either be set upon a skid that raises it from the ground. Alternatively the crate can be manufactured with feet as part of the lower lid .

In order to facilitate shipping the panels are folded into four equal sections as illustrated in . The ability to fold the panels is enabled by the score lines and which enables sub panel to lie adjacent to sub panel sub panel to lie adjacent to sub panel and sub panel to lie adjacent to sub panel as illustrated in . Although the score line is not used to bend the crate during assembly it is critical to the ability to compactly ship the unassembled panels on skids within the top and bottom lids or in shipping crates. Upon reaching it destination is unfolded as illustrated in until it is once again in the configuration of . The fluted panels and are shipped flat along with the panels and can be assembled at the time of use.

An alternate embodiment of the shipping crate is illustrated in wherein crate has the end sub panels and R dimensioned shorter than the end sub panels and R. The remaining sub panels and and the counterpart sub panels R R and R remain equal sizing and carry the horizontal fluted panels and the counterpart horizontal fluted panels R R R. As with previous embodiments the panels and R are folded at score lines R R and . Score lines R and not shown are not folded when assembled and are only used when the panels are being shipped. The embodiment of can also be folded and shipped flat as described heretofore.

The crate in has been assembled with the upper lid and lower lid in place. As seen in this embodiment the end sub panel R is dimensioned to cover only a portion of the end sub panel . As with prior embodiments the score line between sub panels and is not folded. As described heretofore the crate is placed on a skid or other structure to enable movement by forklift.

It is recognized that materials other than corrugated paper board can be used based on current technology and future improvements in technology. Corrugated plastic is not preferred because of ecological reasons but from a structural standpoint corrugated plastic and paper are equivalents. Recyclable plastics are preferred to plastics that are not readily recycled.

It is highly preferable that the two corrugated wall units in the foregoing embodiments are essentially identical. This provides an economy in the manufacture of the units and an advantage in that only one type of unit needs to be stored. It also provides ease of assembling of the crate since there is minimal chance for error.

The corrugated material for the horizontal panels may be triple wall e.g. 600 750 900 1100 or 1300 weight triple wall etc. The corrugated material can also be a double wall e.g. 275 350 500 750 weight double etc.

Similarly a crate can be formed from two 12 by 7 foot panels having two outer subpanels that are about 8 7 and an inner sub panel that is about 4 7 to produce a crate that is 8 4 7 and having overlying outer panels. The long sides thus have two overlaying panels.

The panel dimensions are selected such that at least two panel units are employed to form a crate. At least one panel has two or three subpanels and no panel has more than three subpanels. That is no panel can form more than three sides of the crate. Two panels having three subpanels can be used or four panels with two subpanels can be used. The shortest of the three panels can serve as a door to provide ease of access to the crate interior.

The compression resistance of crates can be tested by using r ASTM D4169 D642. Failure of crates tested under ASTM D4169 D642 occurs when the crate compresses to any extent. The tests are all run to failure and since the tests are run in twenty pounds increments the compression prior to failure that is the maximum compression strength is twenty pounds less than compression at failure.

The combination of Test 1 employs material that is 27 more expensive than the material of Test 2. Nevertheless the combination of Test 2 is 4 stronger than the combination of Test 1.

The combination of Test 2 is 18.3 more expensive than the material of Test 4. Contrary to conventional wisdom the combination of Test 4 is 4 stronger than the combination of Test 3.

The combination of Test 5 is 24.7 more expensive than the material of Test 6. Contrary to conventional wisdom the combination of Test 6 is 4 stronger than the combination of Test 5.

In all tests the 500 double wall horizontal panels have flutes that are horizontally relative to the vertical flutes of the wall panels.

The test results show that the horizontal vertical fluting of tests 5 and 6 are stronger than the triple wall crates of test 1 and 2. The unusual results are attributed to the use of the horizontal fluting to keep the vertical fluting from bowing.

The use of horizontally fluted panels adhered to the vertically oriented wall panel provides a less expense as well as a higher crush strength crate.

The higher crush strength of the 1100 triple wall compared to 1300 triple wall is attributed to the lighter weight material being less likely to bow. The lighter weight paper seems to relax and maintain unbowed. Perhaps the 1100 was easier for the 500 DW horizontal fluting to keep from bowing. The explanation for the unusual results is presented only for guidance and general knowledge but is not a part of the inventions described herein The results are unusual contrary to common logic and therefore an explanation of the tests showing the reverse of what would be expected is not a limitation of the invention Other explanations may come to light in the future.
