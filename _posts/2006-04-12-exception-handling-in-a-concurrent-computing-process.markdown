abstract: The present invention provides a method and system for exception handling in an executable process executing in a concurrent computing environment. The present invention allows a user to interrupt the executable process at any stage of the computation without disconnecting the communication channel among the instances of the executable process. Additionally, the present invention also allows interrupting the concurrent computing process at any stage when an error occurs in the executable process or the communication channel without terminating the communication among the instances of the executable process. Upon notification of an interrupt request, each of the instances of the executable process in the concurrent computing environment flushes any pending incoming messages to return itself to a previous known state while maintaining the communication channel between the instances of the executable process.

The present application generally relates to a concurrent computing process and more specifically to exception handling in the concurrent computing process.

MATLAB is a product of The MathWorks Inc. of Natick Mass. which provides engineers scientists mathematicians and educators across a diverse range of industries with an environment for technical computing applications. MATLAB is an intuitive high performance language and technical computing environment that provides mathematical and graphical tools for mathematical computation data analysis visualization and algorithm development. MATLAB integrates numerical analysis matrix computation signal processing and graphics in an easy to use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation without traditional programming. MATLAB is used to solve complex engineering and scientific problems by developing mathematical models that simulate the problem. A model is prototyped tested and analyzed by running the model under multiple boundary conditions data parameters or just a number of initial guesses. In MATLAB one can easily modify the model plot a new variable or reformulate the problem in a rapid interactive fashion that is typically not feasible in a non interpreted programming such as Fortran or C.

As a desktop application MATLAB allows scientists and engineers to interactively perform complex analysis and modeling in their familiar workstation environment. With many engineering and scientific problems requiring larger and more complex modeling computations accordingly become more resource intensive and time consuming. However a single workstation can be limiting to the size of the problem that can be solved because of the relationship of the computing power of the workstation to the computing power necessary to execute computing intensive iterative processing of complex problems in a reasonable time. For example a simulation of a large complex aircraft model may take a reasonable time to run with a single computation with a specified set of parameters. However the analysis of the problem may also require the model be computed multiple times with a different set of parameters e.g. at one hundred different altitude levels and fifty different aircraft weights to understand the behavior of the model under varied conditions. This would require five thousand computations to analyze the problem as desired and the single workstation would take an unreasonable or undesirable amount of time to perform these simulations. Therefore it is desirable to perform a computation concurrently using multiple workstations when the computation becomes so large and complex that it cannot be completed in a reasonable amount of time on a single workstation.

Applications that are traditionally used as desktop applications such as MATLAB need to be modified to be able to utilize the computing power of concurrent computing such as parallel computing and distributed computing. Each machine or workstation needs to have its local copy of the application and between the different instances of the application there needs to be a way to communicate and pass messages between the machines and workstations so that the multiple machines or workstations in the concurrent computing environment can collaborate with each other.

One example of a message passing method that establishes a communication channel between machines or workstations is Message Passing Interface MPI . MPI is a standard for an interface for message passing that has been used between parallel machines or workstations in concurrent computing systems. In conventional concurrent computing systems computing applications which make use of MPI communications must be launched using a launcher program usually called mpirun or mpiexec . An example of the syntax for calling mpirun is as follows. mpirun np

Once an application has been launched using the above MPI method on a concurrent computing system and an error occurs the default behavior is to abort all the parallel processes immediately and disconnect the communication channel established between the multiple machines and workstations. This behavior is not desirable as connections need to be re established before concurrent computing can be utilized again.

The present invention provides a method and system for exception handling in an executable process executing in a concurrent computing environment. The present invention allows a user to interrupt the executable process at any stage of the computation without disconnecting the communication channel among the instances of the executable process. Additionally the present invention also allows interrupting the concurrent computing process at any stage when an error occurs in the executable process or the communication channel without terminating the communication among the instances of the executable process. Upon notification of an interrupt request each of the instances of the executable process in the concurrent computing environment flushes any pending incoming messages to return itself to a previous known state while maintaining the communication channel between the instances of the executable process.

In one embodiment of the present invention a method for providing exception handling among a plurality of instances of a concurrent computing process is provided. The method includes the step of launching the plurality of instances of the concurrent computing process on one or more computing devices where the plurality of instances includes a first instance and a second instance. The method also includes the step of establishing a communication channel for communication among the plurality of instances thereby forming a collaboration to execute a computational job. The method further includes the step of executing the computational job concurrently on the plurality of instances. The method also includes the steps of detecting an interrupt request on one of the plurality of instances and terminating the execution of the computational job while maintaining the communication among the plurality of instances established by the communication channel.

In one aspect of the present invention the interrupt request is sent from a user instructing the termination of the execution of the computational job. The interrupt request may be instead caused by an error occurred in the concurrent computing process. The interrupt request may also be caused by an error occurred in the communication channel. In another aspect of the present invention the method may further include the steps of notifying the first instance of the detection of the interrupt request and notifying the second instance of the detection of the interrupt request. The method may also include the step of terminating a sending of a data and a receiving of the data between the first instance and the second instance. The method may further include the step of returning the first instance and the second instance to a state prior to the sending and the receiving of the data between the first and second instances. In a further aspect of the present invention the method includes the further step of returning the plurality of instances to a state prior to the execution of the computational job.

In another embodiment of the present invention a storage medium storing computer implemented instructions for providing exception handling among a plurality of instances of a concurrent computing process is provided. The instructions include instruction for launching the plurality of instances of the concurrent computing process on one or more computing devices. The instructions can also include instruction for establishing a communication channel for communication among the plurality of instances thereby forming a collaboration to execute a computational job. The instructions can further include instruction for executing the computational job concurrently on the plurality of instances. The instructions can also include the instructions for detecting an interrupt request on one of the plurality of instances and terminating the execution of the computational job while maintaining the communication among the plurality of instances established by the communication channel.

In a further embodiment of the present invention a system providing exception handling among a plurality of instances of a concurrent computing process is provided. The system includes an executable process comprising a concurrent computing environment for allowing a plurality of instances of the executable process to execute concurrently the plurality of instances establish communication via a communication channel and form a collaboration to execute a computational job where the executable process is capable of detecting an interrupt request associated with the computational job and terminate the execution of the computational job without terminating the communication via the communication channel.

In one aspect of the present invention the interrupt request is sent from a user instructing the termination of the execution of the computational job. The interrupt request can also be caused by an error occurred in the concurrent computing process or an error occurred in the communication channel.

In yet another embodiment of the present invention a method for a computing device to distribute to a remote computing device a plurality of instructions is provided. The method includes receiving a request from the remote computing device for the plurality of instructions. The plurality of instructions include the instructions for launching the plurality of instances of the concurrent computing process on one or more computing devices wherein the plurality of instances includes a first instance and a second instance establishing a communication channel for communication among the plurality of instances thereby forming a collaboration to execute a computational job executing the computational job concurrently on the plurality of instances detecting an interrupt request on one of the plurality of instances and terminating the execution of the computational job while maintaining the communication among the plurality of instances established by the communication channel. The method also includes forwarding the plurality of instructions to the remote computing device. In one aspect of the present invention the computing device is a server. The remote computing device can be but not limited to a client or a node on a network such as the Internet.

The concurrent computing client can be a technical computing software application that provides a technical computing and or graphical modeling environment for generating block diagram models and to define mathematical algorithms for simulating models. The concurrent computing client may include all or a portion of the functionality provided by the stand alone desktop application of MATLAB . Additionally the concurrent computing client can be any of the software programs available in the MATLAB product family. Furthermore the concurrent computing client can be a custom software program or other software that accesses functionalities of software programs in the MATLAB product family via an interface such as an application programming interface or by other means. One of ordinarily skill in the art will appreciate the various combinations of client types may access the functionalities of the system.

In one embodiment of the present invention concurrent computing client is also a concurrent computing lab. In such a configuration communication channels are setup among all the concurrent computing labs concurrent computing client and concurrent computing labs A N . Each of the concurrent computing labs including the concurrent computing client has its local copy of a computer program that is executed in the corresponding concurrent computing labs so there is no main concurrent computing lab that distributes executions to the other concurrent computing labs. The concurrent computing client will additionally have the functionality to accept inputs and or commands from a user related to the computer program using a tool such as an Integrated Development Environment IDE . The concurrent computing client and concurrent computing labs A N can be configured to perform distributed computing or parallel computing.

In one embodiment of the present invention functions can be defined by the concurrent computing client with an application programming interface and or programming language representing a technical computing task to be executed by either a technical computing environment local to the client or remote on the workstations A N. Tasks can be declared on a concurrent computing client and additionally organized into jobs. A job is a logical unit of activities or tasks that are processed and or managed collectively. A task defines a technical computing command such as a MATLAB command to be executed and the number of arguments and any input data to the arguments. A job is a group of one or more tasks.

In one aspect of the present invention a task can be directly distributed by the concurrent computing client to one or more computing resources such as workstations A N. A computing resource performs technical computing on a task and may return a result to the concurrent computing client .

In another aspect of the present invention the system includes a server on which runs a scheduler . The scheduler can be a scheduler provided with executable process a generic scheduler or a third party scheduler that is designed and provided a company or individual that does not provide executable process . For example given that executable process is parallel computing with MATLAB by The MathWorks Inc. of Natick Mass. a third party scheduler can be MPI Exec LSF Condor Microsoft Compute Cluster Server or PBS. The server communicates over a network communication channel on the network to the workstations A N. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that any of the workstations A N may include more than one technical computing lab to practice the present invention. Additionally client and server may also include one or more concurrent computing labs.

The scheduler comprises one or more application software components to provide for the automatic distribution of tasks from the concurrent computing client to one or more of the concurrent computing labs A N. The scheduler allows the concurrent computing client to delegate the management of task distribution to the scheduler . The scheduler may also set up for concurrent computing client the concurrent computing labs A N by using the information received from the concurrent computing client regarding the number of concurrent computing labs needed and other configuration information. Hence the concurrent computing client does not need to know the specifics of the concurrent computing labs A N. The concurrent computing client can define a function to submit the task to the scheduler and get a result of the task from the scheduler . As such the scheduler provides a level of indirection between the concurrent computing client and the concurrent computing labs A N.

This eases the distributed programming and integration burden on the concurrent computing client . The concurrent computing client does not need to have prior knowledge of the availability of the workstations A N. For multiple task submissions from the concurrent computing client the scheduler can manage and handle the delegations of the tasks to the concurrent computing labs A N and hold the results of the tasks on behalf of the concurrent computing client for retrieval after the completion of technical computing of all the tasks distributed by concurrent computing client . In an alternative implementation the concurrent computing labs A N may provide concurrent computing client directly the results of the tasks assigned to concurrent computing labs A N by the scheduler . The scheduler can further include an object oriented interface to provide control of delegating tasks and obtaining results in the system . The scheduler also provides an interface for managing a group of tasks collectively as a single unit called a job and on behalf of a concurrent computing client submitting those tasks making up the job and obtaining the results of each of the tasks until the job is completed. One of ordinarily skill in the art will recognize the functions and operations of the scheduler can be separated into various software components applications and interfaces. Additionally the functions and operations of the scheduler may reside on either the concurrent computing client or one of the concurrent computing labs A N instead of the server .

Additionally each of the client the server and the workstations A N can be running the same or different operating systems with the same or different processors. For example the client can be running Microsoft Windows the server can be running a version of Unix and the workstations A N a version of Linux. Alternatively each of the client the server and the workstations A N can be running Microsoft Windows . One of ordinarily skill in the art will recognize the various combinations of operating systems and processors that can be running on any of the computing devices client server workstations A N .

In one embodiment of the present invention the collaboration is dynamic. In other words a user can modify or change the size of the collaboration by adding another computing resource. The user may be provided on the client with a user interface to modify or change the size of the collaboration or designate a specific resource to add or remove from the collaboration. In another embodiment of the present invention the client can forward the information to the scheduler which will determine a concurrent computing lab to be added or removed from the collaboration.

One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a corresponding interruptible function call to Send can be achieved the same way as the interruptible Receive function call. Therefore an instance of the executable process can make a function call to an interruptible function call to receive or send messages. When an interrupt request is detected special actions can be taken to handle the interrupt request. In one embodiment of the present invention a function call is made when an interrupt request is detected to handle the interrupt request. For example using the same example from before when a function call to interruptibleReceive returns a result that indicates an interrupt is requested another function can be made to handle the interrupt request.

One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are many ways to handle an interrupt request. In one embodiment of the present invention the execution of the computational job is terminated in step while maintaining the communication among the multiple instances established by the communication channel . Additionally data sending and receiving can be terminated between instances in step . Furthermore pending data for sending or receiving by an instance can be flushed so that the instance can return to a previous state before the interrupt request is made.

After an interrupt has been requested each of the instances of the executable process executing on the different concurrent computing lab needs to flush its message queue. For example the following piece of MATLAB code can be run on all labs which have successfully been interrupted given that the executable process is parallel computing with MATLAB or distributed computing with MATLAB 

This code simply queries the incoming message queue to check for messages from any instance of the executable process and if there is a message it will be received and taken out of the queue. The act of receiving messages in one instance of the executable process may allow other instances of the executable process to proceed and eventually respond to the interrupt request. Therefore it is necessary to repeat the flushing procedure until all instances of the executable process have completed a round of flushing together.

Depending on the type of the interrupt request different actions can be taken and the instances can determine to return to a different previous state. In one embodiment of the present invention the instances are returned to a state prior to the sending and the receiving of the data between the instances in step . In another embodiment of the present invention the instances can be returned to a state prior to the execution of the computational job in step .

After the multiple instances start to execute a computational job a user can interrupt the computational job by requesting an interrupt. An interrupt can be requested using a specific button provided by a graphical user interface of the executable process . Alternatively an interrupt can be requested using one or more keystrokes on a keyboard such as using Ctrl C on the executable process . One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are many different ways the executable process and or the computing device can provide for a user to interrupt execution of a computational job on the multiple instances of the executable process . Once a user interrupt request is detected by an instance of the executable process a function call can be made to propagate the interrupt request to the rest of the instances in the collaboration . The following code shows a pseudo code for handling an interrupt request from a user.

Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore it must be expressly understood that the illustrated embodiments have been shown only for the purposes of example and should not be taken as limiting the invention which is defined by the following claims. These claims are to be read as including what they set forth literally and also those equivalent elements which are insubstantially different even though not identical in other respects to what is shown and described in the above illustrations.
