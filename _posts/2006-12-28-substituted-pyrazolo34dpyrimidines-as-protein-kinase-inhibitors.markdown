This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 754 685 filed Dec. 29 2005.

This invention pertains to compounds that inhibit protein kinases compositions containing the compounds and methods of treating diseases using the compounds.

Numerous human diseases are characterized by increased and uncontrolled cell growth. This biology is driven in many cases by increased growth factor signaling. In addition these pathologies often require an expanding blood supply and new vessel growth. Protein kinases are key components of both cell proliferation and endothelial cell expansion. Kinases are thus important targets for therapeutic intervention in pathologies characterized by uncontrolled cell growth.

One embodiment of this invention therefore pertains to compounds that inhibit protein kinases and have Formula I
