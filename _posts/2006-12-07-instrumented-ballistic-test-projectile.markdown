The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to ballistic munitions and in particular to ballistic projectiles that measure conditions in the launching tube.

Military organizations have always needed a device to obtain information about the interior ballistic environment of cannon launching projectiles. Knowledge of launching conditions is used to design cannons and munitions to achieve optimum launching and accuracy. Only within the past 50 years have scientists started placing sensors into projectiles to record the interior ballistic event. Early electronic devices were pressure sensors that were hard wired to a data acquisition system located near the cannon. When the projectile was launched the data acquisition system would record several milliseconds of data before the wire was broken.

More recently commercially available electronics have allowed the instrumentation of projectiles with small accelerometer sensors and pressure gages. These devices either recorded or telemetered data at a relatively low frequency rate thus missing phenomena or smoothing out the data. Additionally these older devices were one time shot devices that were destroyed during the test.

It is an object of the invention to provide an instrumented ballistic test projectile that senses and transmits interior inside of gun tube ballistic information in realtime.

It is another object of the invention to provide an instrumented ballistic test projectile that is reusable with little or no refurbishment.

It is a further object of the invention to provide an instrumented ballistic test projectile that measures base pressure and side wall pressure.

One aspect of the invention is a ballistic test projectile comprising a nose section including a windshield and aft of the windshield an ogive a body section aft of the nose section the body section comprising a generally cylindrical body connected to the ogive a base section aft of the body section the base section comprising a base adapter connected to the body and a base bottom connected to the base adapter a base pressure gage disposed in the base bottom at least one side pressure gage disposed in the body and an electronics cup disposed in the body the electronics cup comprising a battery cup a signal conditioning cup a multiplexer cup an accelerometer cup and a transmitter cup.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention comprises a projectile that senses and transmits the interior ballistic event in realtime. The primary interest is in conditions inside the launch tube however the projectile may also be used to measure and transmit data once the projectile has exited the launch tube. The projectile may be launched from a cannon tube or mortar tube for example. The instrumented ballistic test projectile is rugged enough so that most of its components are reusable with limited refurbishment. The present invention withstands the high acceleration and spin rate of the cannon launching environment.

A combined telemetry and sensor system and hardened projectile body allow the capture of the pressurized environment on the base and side of the projectile as it is being launched. A tri axial accelerometer module senses the acceleration forces in all three linear directions. The signals from the sensors are combined and transmitted at an extremely high rate so as not to degrade the signals. Receiving antennae located near the muzzle exit of the cannon receive the signals from the on board transmitter. A ground station receives and records the data. The projectile can be recovered and with minor refurbishment reused. Reusing the projectile saves money.

The invention incorporates a modularized power supply accelerometer module and signal conditioning and telemetry system with an integrated antenna. In one embodiment the telemetry system is an analog system which multiplexes signals and then transmits them. In another embodiment the telemetry system is a digital system. The modularized system easily plugs into the projectile body which has integral pressure gages in the side wall and in the base. Several gages are located in the wall and generally one gage is located in the base. An ogive and windshield make up the forward section of the projectile protecting the electronics from gun launch and ground impact. In the event that the ground impact damages the windshield or ogive these parts are easily replaceable.

During launch the slip band obturator is destroyed. The slip band obtrurator is a band on the base of the projectile that seals the expanding cannon gases from leaking past the projectile. The base easily comes off and can be replaced if damaged. When the base is removed the obturator band is then replaced.

A base pressure gage is disposed in the base bottom . The base pressure gage measures pressure at the base of the projectile . At least one side pressure gage is disposed in the body . Preferably a plurality of side pressure gages for example four are disposed circumferentially around the body equidistant from each other. Side pressure gages measure pressure along the side wall of projectile . Passageways in body connect the side pressure gages to the side wall pressure field. An electronics cup is disposed in the body and includes a battery cup a signal conditioning cup a multiplexer cup an accelerometer cup and a transmitter cup .

The base pressure gage with shim is disposed in a protective base gage holder . Shim O ring and rear nut fit on the aft end of the base gage holder . A base gage tube threads into the forward end of the base gage holder . A base tube captive ring attaches the base gage tube to the rear nacelle . Coaxial plug electrically connects the base pressure gage to wiring not shown inside the rear nacelle .

An obturator and obturator ring are disposed on the base section . In one embodiment the obturator is a slip obturator such that substantially no spin is imparted to the projectile . A non spinning projectile is desirable to limit the range of the projectile. In most cases the ballistic information that is desired relates to conditions inside the launch tube. Therefore it is not necessary that the projectile have any range beyond the muzzle of the tube. Spinning projectiles are much more stable than non spinning projectiles and therefore have longer ranges. A non spinning projectile is unstable and will for example turn sideways or turn completely around after exiting the tube. This behavior creates a lot of drag which lessens the range of the projectile .

The electronic cups plug into and are stacked on top of each other in the electronics cup . Because functionality is separated by cup the overall function of the electronics cup may be varied by substituting other component cups not shown . The plug in modularity of the electronics cup makes the projectile easily reconfigurable. Also in case the electronic components are damaged the cups are easily replaceable so that the projectile has a short down time.

Experience has shown that the projectile may land on its nose or its base. The ogive preferably comprises aluminum. If the ogive and windshield are damaged they are easily replaced because of their threaded connections. When the slip obturator is used the projectile has little or no spin and more often will land on its base. Thus base bottom preferably comprises aluminum. Base bottom is threaded onto base adapter for easy replacement if necessary. The body base adapter and rear nacelle preferably comprise steel. These components provide strength to the projectile and protect the electrical components inside the projectile. In a typical landing these components will not be damaged.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
