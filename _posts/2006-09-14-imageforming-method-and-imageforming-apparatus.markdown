The present invention relates to an image forming method of forming an image on a recording medium such as a plastic sheet in an electrophotographic process and an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine or a printer using the same.

In electrophotographic processes a color image has been formed for example in the following image forming steps. Light is first irradiated on a color manuscript the reflected optical image is detected by a color CCD with color separation and image signals for multiple colors are obtained in an image processor after predetermined image processing and color correction. For example semiconductor laser is modulated based on the image signals for multiple colors and semiconductor laser light modulated according to the image signals is emitted from the semiconductor laser. Multiple electrostatic latent images are formed on a photoreceptor by irradiating the laser beam multiple times each for one of the colors. The multiple electrostatic latent images are developed sequentially with color toners for example in four colors of yellow Y magenta M cyan C and black K . The developed toner images are then transferred from the photoreceptor onto an image receiving medium such as paper and are heat fixed with a fixing device having an heat fixing roll or the like to form a color image on the image receiving medium.

The color toners used in these color image forming apparatuses are for example particles having an average diameter of 1 to 15 m made of a binder resin such as polyester resin styrene acrylic copolymer or styrene butadiene copolymer containing a colorant dispersed therein on which fine particles having an average diameter of approximately 5 to 100 nm for example inorganic fine particles such as of silicon oxide titanium oxide or aluminum oxide or resin fine particles such as of PMMA or PVDF are adhered. Examples of the colorant include yellow Y colorants such as benzidine yellow quinoline yellow and Hanza Yellow magenta M colorants such as rhodamine B rose bengal and pigment red cyan C colorants such as phthalocyanine blue aniline blue and pigment blue black K colorants such as carbon black and aniline black blends of color pigments and the like.

The thus obtained color image made of the color toners has a certain degree of glossiness since the surface thereof is smoothened at heat fixation. On the other hand the paper surface is normally not glossy and thus the color image has a different glossiness from that of the paper surface. In addition the glossiness of the color image is known to change as a result of variation of the viscosity of the toner at heat fixation depending on the kind of the binder resin used for color toner and the method of heat fixing.

By the way preferred glossiness of a color image varies depending on the kind and application of the image. For example when the color image is formed on a plastic sheet such as a display board or an outdoor display a color image having a uniform surface higher in glossiness is generally preferred.

transferring the toner image from the surface of the image carrier onto an image receiving layer of a belt shaped intermediate transfer film in which the image receiving layer is provided on a surface of a base material 

superimposing the intermediate transfer film on a surface of a recording medium such that the toner image contacts the surface of the recording medium 

forming a laminate by pressure bonding the superimposed intermediate transfer film onto the recording medium by application of heat and pressure and

peeling the base material off the image receiving layer at the interface therebetween so that the entire image forming surface of the recording medium is covered with the image receiving layer and so that the image is formed between the recording medium and the image receiving layer.

The recording medium may be any recording medium on which an image can be formed by an electrophotographic process such as paper or a plastic sheet and the surface irregularity of the recording medium varies depending on the kind of the recording medium. The surface irregularity of the image obtained also varies depending on whether the image is monochromic or colored on the particle diameter of the toner used for image formation or on the image forming condition for example fixing temperature etc. . Thus in conventional image forming methods it is quite difficult to make the surface smoothness of the recording medium used always identical with that of the formed image. For that reason it has been unavoidable that a difference in glossiness is generated between the image and non image regions on the image forming surface.

The image forming method according to an aspect of the invention is significantly different from the conventional electrophotographic image forming methods using an intermediate transfer body such as an intermediate transfer belt in that a belt shaped transfer film intermediate transfer film having a base material and an image receiving layer provided on a surface of the base material is used as the intermediate transfer body.

The intermediate transfer film is not particularly limited as long as it is belt shaped. The aspect ratio length width thereof is preferably 5 or more more preferably 10 or more and still more preferably 20 or more. The length of the intermediate transfer film is preferably 1 m or more more preferably 2 m or more and still more preferably 4 m or more.

The width of the belt shaped intermediate transfer film means a length in the direction perpendicular to the rotation direction of the image carrier and may be normally set to be almost identical with the width of the image carrier or with the width of the recording medium to be used length in the direction perpendicular to the recording medium supplying direction .

The intermediate transfer film may be an endless film. In such a case the length of the intermediate transfer film means the length of the endless film along one round.

On the other hand conventionally when a large quantity of recording media having an image formed thereon are produced using an intermediate transfer film it has been necessary to form the image on a recording medium by using a large sheet shaped intermediate transfer film and cut the recording medium into pieces of a predetermined size. However high productivity has not been always achieved since the recording media has to be cut after image formation.

From the viewpoint the recording medium for use in the aspect of the invention may be sheet shaped. When the recording medium is sheet shaped use of a recording medium previously cut into the size of the final product eliminates the necessity for cutting the recording medium after image formation and thus gives high productivity.

The length of the intermediate transfer film in this case is preferably at least 5 times more preferably at least 10 times and still more preferably at least 20 times the length of the recording medium in the feed direction.

The shape of the recording medium for use in the aspect of the invention is not limited to a sheet shape and may be for example a belt shape. In such a case a belt shaped recording medium having an image formed thereon is obtained. The width of the intermediate transfer film in this case may be almost identical with the width of the belt shaped recording medium and the length of the intermediate transfer film is preferably at least one time more preferably at least 5 times and still more preferably at least 10 times the length of the belt shaped recording medium.

In the image forming method according to an aspect of the invention it is possible to form a monochromic image by using one kind of toner and also possible to form a color image by using two or more kinds of toner different in color. Since a color image is fixed after two or more color toner images different in color are superimposed the color image tends to have a greater image surface irregularity than a monochromic image and normally has enlarged difference in glossiness between the image and non image regions therefore the glossiness on the entire image forming surface is likely to be uneven.

However in the image forming method according to an aspect of the invention it is possible to prevent such a problem and achieve uniform glossiness on the entire image forming surface because the image and non image regions are both covered with an image receiving layer.

Each process in the image forming method according to an aspect of the invention will be described below. As described above the image forming method according to an aspect of the invention include forming a toner image transferring superimposing fixing forming of a laminate and peeling and optionally as necessary other processes employed in known electrophotographic image forming methods such as cleaning the image carrier surface after transfer of the toner image onto the intermediate transfer film.

The formation of the toner image can be conducted similarly to a conventional image forming method and the transferring can also be conducted similarly to that in conventional image forming methods except that the intermediate transfer film described above is used as the intermediate transfer body.

The superimposing fixing and forming of a laminate are performed between the transferring and the peeling and may be performed in the order of superimposing fixing and forming of a laminate process A or in the order of fixing superimposing and forming of a laminate process B . As an alternative the fixing and the forming of a laminate may be conducted simultaneously after the superimposing process C or the superimposing and the forming of a laminate may be conducted simultaneously after the fixing process D . However it is preferable from the simplification of the process to conduct the superimposing the fixing and the forming of a laminate simultaneously process E . In the process E to be exact the fixing and the forming of a laminate are conducted at the same time immediately after the superimposing.

The processes A C D and E in which the fixing is conducted after the superimposing have an advantage in that heating unit for fixing such as a heating roll does not directly contact the toner image during fixing of the toner image so that offsetting of the toner image onto the heating unit does not occur.

A device having similar structure to conventional fixing devices can be used in process E. An example is a heat pressing unit comprising a heating roll and a pressure roll pressed against the heating roll. When using such a unit it is possible to conduct fixing and forming of a laminate by passing the intermediate transfer film and the recording medium in the stacked state through the nip portion between the heating roll and the pressure roll.

After the above processes the base material of the laminated film is peeled off the image receiving layer at the interface therebetween. In this way a recording medium whose surface having the image is entirely covered with the image receiving layer can be obtained.

The peeling is not particularly limited as long as the base material can be peeled off the image receiving layer at the interface therebetween. The peeling may be conducted by applying a force that pulls one side or both sides of the laminate in the thickness direction of the laminate. When the peeling force is applied on one side of the laminate the other side may be fixed.

When a recording medium consisting of a plastic film is used for production of a plastic card in an aspect of the invention the plastic card obtained after the peeling is deformed in some cases if the heat resistance of the plastic film in the laminate is low. The reason is as follows. The laminate after the fixing and the forming of the laminate has a quite high temperature. Therefore when the laminate just after the formation thereof is subjected to the peeling the plastic card itself easily deforms upon application of a moderate external force. This problem occurs more frequently when a plastic film consisting of a material having a relatively low glass transition temperature such as a vinyl chloride film or a PETG film a modified PET resin film including at least ethylene glycol terephthalic acid and 1 4 cyclohexanedimethanol as copolymerization components is used or when the fixing temperature is higher than the glass transition temperature of the resin material constituting the plastic film.

Accordingly when prevention of such a deformation is desired it is possible to conduct a cooling process in which the laminate is cooled in the state of being sandwiched between a pair of members whose surfaces facing both surfaces of the laminate are planar after the fixing and the forming of the laminate but before the peeling.

When such a cooling process is conducted the sufficiently heated laminate after the fixing and the forming of the laminate is sufficiently cooled to a temperature at which the laminate hardly deforms upon application of a moderate force while the flat shape of the laminate is maintained before the peeling. Consequently prevention of the deformation of the finally obtained plastic card is ensured. This method is effective particularly when the recording medium to be used is a vinyl chloride film or a PETG film or when the fixing temperature is higher than the glass transition temperature of the resin material constituting the plastic card.

The cooling conducted in the cooling process may be natural cooling or forced cooling. Forced cooling is preferred since the cooling time can be shortened.

In the image forming method according to an aspect of the invention the toner image transferred onto the surface of the intermediate transfer film may be temporarily fixed by being preheated after the transferring but before the fixing. Fusing among the toner particles constituting the toner image or between the toner particles and the image receiving layer thereby occurs before fixing and thus deterioration of the toner image can be prevented at fixing. Therefore deterioration of the obtained image can be prevented.

When the temporary fixing is conducted the temporary fixing is preferably conducted by heating to a somewhat lower approximately 60 C. to 80 C. lower temperature than the temperature at fixing the toner image using heating a device such as heating roll disposed at one or both surfaces of the intermediate transfer film.

The recording medium can be preheated to a temperature suitable for fixing in advance by heating the recording medium in this manner before fixing or before superimposing conducted simultaneously with the fixing.

It is thus possible to easily prevent generation of fixing defects and make the fixing temperature at fixing lower than before. The preheating described above is particularly effective when a thicker recording medium such as plastic film is used. Increase in the thickness of recording medium leads to increase in the heat capacity of the recording medium itself and makes it difficult for the short term heating at fixing to sufficiently heat the recording medium to a temperature suitable for fixing further sufficient heating of a recording medium such as plastic film is likely to cause thermal deformation of the recording medium. However when the recording medium is preheated before fixing it is possible to prevent fixing defects caused by insufficient heating of the recording medium and thermal deformation of the recording medium. From the viewpoints above it is possible to conduct preheating when the recording medium to be used is a medium containing a thermoplastic material such as plastic film and the thickness thereof is approximately 0.5 mm to 5.0 mm.

Hereinafter the belt shaped intermediate transfer film for use in an aspect of the invention will be described in more details. The intermediate transfer film for use in an aspect of the invention includes a base material and an image receiving layer provided on one surface of the base material.

The toner image formed on the image carrier surface is transferred onto the surface of the image receiving layer at the transferring. The image receiving layer and the base material should be releasable a release layer containing a releasing material may be provided between the image receiving layer and the base material or the releasability may be imparted by coating a releasing material on one of i the base material side of the image receiving layer or ii the image receiving layer side of the base material.

The releasing material may be for example a silicone based hardcoat material and examples thereof include condensation resins containing a silane based composition and mixed materials containing a condensation resin of a silane based composition and a colloidal silica dispersion.

When a release layer is provided between the base material and the image receiving layer of intermediate transfer film the peeling strength between the release layer and the image receiving layer is preferably in the range of 9.8 mN cm to 4.9 N cm 1 gf cm to 500 gf cm more preferably in the range of 19.6 mN cm to 0.98 N cm 2 gf cm to 100 gf cm .

A peeling strength of less than 9.8 mN cm 1 gf cm may lead to spontaneous peeling of the base material off the image receiving layer. On the other hand a peeling strength of more than 4.9 N cm 500 gf cm may hinder peeling at the interface between the base material and the image receiving layer when a peeling force is applied to both surfaces of the laminate obtained by laminating the recording medium with the intermediate transfer film.

The peeling force between the release layer and the image receiving layer is determined by adhering an acrylic adhesive tape having a width of 10 mm Nitto Polyester Tape 31B manufactured by Nitto Denko Corp. to a length of 200 mm on the image receiving layer surface of the intermediate transfer film at a linear pressure of 500 g cm and measuring the stress when the tape is peeled off at a speed of 10 mm sec and a peeling angle of 180 . The measured stress is assumed as the peeling force.

The image receiving layer includes a thermoplastic material. The thermoplastic material is not particularly limited and may contain a resin similar to the binder resin contained in the toner used in image formation in particular a polyester resin. Polyester resins are widely used as the binder resin for toner. Therefore the fixability of the image forming material onto the image receiving layer can be improved by adding a similar resin into the image receiving layer. Examples of the polyester resins include common polyester resins as well as silicone modified polyester resins urethane modified polyester resins and acrylic modified polyesters.

The base material is not particularly limited and may be a plastic film as a typical example. Among plastic films a polyacetate film a cellulose triacetate film a nylon film a polyester film a polycarbonate film a polysulfone film a polystyrene film a polyphenylene ether film a cycloolefin film a polypropylene film a cellophane an ABS acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin film a biaxially stretched polyethylene terephthalate PET film or the like can be used favorably. Among them use of biaxially stretched polyethylene terephthalate is preferable from the point of cost performance.

The base material is heated and pressed during fixing. In addition when a recording medium with a relatively large thickness such as plastic sheet is used the fixing temperature should be set at a higher temperature because of its larger heat capacity and thus the base material is heated to high temperature in some cases. There are cases in which such heating and pressurization or an excessively severe heating condition causes elongation of the base material in the longitudinal direction during fixing which causes elongation of the image.

Thus use of a plastic film superior in the stretching resistance during heating and pressurization is preferable from the viewpoint of suppressing the image elongation. Examples of the films include biaxially stretched polyethylene naphthalate PEN film aromatic polyamide aramide film polyimide film polyphenylene sulfide PPS film and polyether imide PEI film.

A laminate film including a stack composed of a combination of two or more of the above films may be used as necessary as the film for the base material.

The surface roughness of the surface of the base material which surface is on the side at which the image receiving layer is provided is not particularly limited but the center line average roughness Ra is preferably 1 m or less more preferably 0.1 m or less in order to obtain high glossiness on the entire image forming surface. A center line average roughness Ra of more than 1 m may prohibit high glossiness.

The center line average roughness Ra of the base material may be smaller from the viewpoint of obtaining high glossiness but is preferably 0.05 m or more from the practical viewpoint.

On the other hand the center line average roughness Ra is preferably 20 m or more more preferably 25 m or more when the entire image forming surface is desired to have a matt finishing low glossiness . A center line average roughness Ra of less than 20 m may make it difficult to make the entire image forming surface appear matt finished. Although the center line average roughness Ra of the base material may be greater from the viewpoint of obtaining matt finishing the center line average roughness Ra is preferably 50 m or less from the practical viewpoint.

The center line average roughness Ra is determined with a stylus profilometer DEKTAK3ST manufactured by Ulvac Inc.

The thickness of the base material is preferably in the range of 10 m to 200 m more preferably in the range of 25 m to 100 m from the viewpoint of preventing conveyance defects and deterioration in image quality. A thickness of less than 10 m may cause conveyance defects in the image forming apparatus while a thickness of more than 200 m may lead to deterioration in image quality at transfer.

The thickness of the base material is preferably 50 m or less more preferably 40 m or less for prevention of generation of minute residual air in the image forming surface after forming of a laminate. A thickness of the base material of more than 50 m may lead to generation of fine residual air on the image forming surface because the intermediate transfer film cannot follow and adhere to the irregularity on the surface of the recording medium which surface contacts the intermediate transfer film at forming of a laminate. The thickness of the base material may be smaller from the viewpoint of preventing generation of minute residual air but is preferably 10 m or more more preferably 18 m or more in practice from the viewpoint of preventing occurrence of conveyance defects and others associated with insufficient strength of the base material.

From the viewpoint of securing the strength of the base material and suppressing the minute residual air and image elongation examples of the plastic films favorably used as a base material having a thickness in the range of 10 m to 50 m include the biaxially stretched PEN film aromatic polyamide aramide film polyimide film PPS film and PEI film described above.

The surface resistivity of at least the image receiving layer side of the intermediate transfer film at a temperature of 23 C. and a humidity of 55 RH is preferably in the range of 1.0 10 to 1.0 10 more preferably in the range of 1.0 10 to 1.0 10 and still more preferably both sides of the intermediate transfer film have a surface resistivity with the above range.

When the surface resistivity is less than 1.0 10 the resistance of the intermediate transfer film especially under high temperature and high humidity becomes excessively low and for example the transfer of the toner from the image carrier is disturbed in some cases. When the surface resistivity is more than 1.0 10 the resistance of the intermediate transfer film becomes excessively high and for example the toner from the image carrier cannot be transferred onto the film surface and image defects occurs in some cases.

The surface resistivity is measured by a method in conformity with the double ring electrode method defined in JIS K6911 which is incorporated herein by reference and the calculation formulae described therein. More specifically the surface resistivity is obtained from the electric current value at the time a voltage of 1000 V has been applied to circular electrodes for example HR probe of HIRESTER IP manufactured by Mitsubishi Yuka Co. Ltd. connected to a digital ultrahigh resistance microammeter R8340 manufactured by Advantest corporation for 60 seconds in an environment of 23.degree. C. and 55 RH using the formulae defined in JIS K6911.

The surface resistivity can be controlled in the range of 1.0 10to 1.0 10 adding a polymeric conductive agent a surfactant conductivity metal oxide particles or the like as an antistatic agent to the image receiving layer by adding a surfactant a polymeric conductive agent conductive fine particles or the like to the resin during production of the film for the base material by applying a surfactant onto the film surface by vapor depositing a metal thin film or by adding an adequate amount of surfactant or the like to the adhesive or the like.

The recording medium for use in an aspect of the invention is not particularly limited as long as an image can be formed thereon and examples thereof include common papers plastic metal or ceramic films and other films. Use of a plastic film is preferable.

The recording medium may be colored by addition of a pigment or dye. The recording medium may be film shaped or plate shaped or may have a shape having such a thickness as to be nonflexible or as to impart the required strength for use as a recording medium.

When the image recording medium is applied to an IC card a magnetic card or the like IC memory antenna external terminal and the like are embedded in the recording medium. In an exemplary embodiment a magnetic stripe a hologram or the like is separately printed on the recording medium and characters may be embossed as necessary.

The recording medium is preferably a plastic film more preferably a PET polyethylene terephthalate film a PETG film modified PET resin film copolymerized with at least ethylene glycol terephthalic acid and 1 4 cyclohexanedimethanol or a polyvinyl chloride film. The thickness of the plastic film is preferably from 50 to 5 000 m and more preferably from 100 to 1000 m.

Typical examples of the plastic films include acetate film cellulose triacetate film nylon film polyester film polycarbonate film polystyrene film polyphenylene sulfide film polypropylene film polyimide film and cellophane and among them polyester film can used favorably. A biaxially stretched polyethylene terephthalate film can be used particularly favorably.

The developer used in forming a toner image in an aspect of the invention may be a one component developer consisting of toner or a two component developer consisting of a toner and a carrier and may be a known developer.

Any conventionally known toner containing a binder resin and a colorant may be used as the toner without restriction. The binder resin may be a known binder resin and is preferably a polyester resin. The weight average molecular weight thereof may be from 5 000 to 12 000.

The colorant is not particularly limited if it is commonly used in toner and may be selected from known cyan pigments or dyes magenta pigments or dyes yellow pigments or dyes and black pigments or dyes and others. It is important to reduce the irregular reflection at the interface of the colorant pigment and the binder for obtaining high glossiness and the combination with a colorant containing a small diameter pigment uniformly dispersed therein described in JP A No. 4 242752 is effective.

The particle diameter of the toner is not particularly limited but is preferably from 4 m to 8 m from the viewpoint of obtaining a high definition image.

The toner and the carrier for use in an aspect of the invention may be prepared as needed or may be commercially available products.

Hereinafter the image forming apparatus according to an aspect of the invention will be described. The image forming apparatus according to an aspect of the invention is not particularly limited if it uses the image forming method according to an aspect of the invention and specifically may have the following configuration.

a belt shaped intermediate transfer film including a base material and an image receiving layer provided on a surface of the base material 

a transfer unit that transfers the toner image from the surface of the image carrier to the image receiving layer of the intermediate transfer film 

a heat pressing unit which fixes the toner image by superimposing the intermediate transfer film on a surface of a recording medium such that the toner image contacts the surface of the recording medium and applying heat and pressure to the intermediate transfer film and the recording medium and which forms a laminate by pressure bonding the intermediate transfer film to the recording medium and

a peeling unit that peels the base material off the image receiving layer at the interface therebetween.

The heat pressing unit is a unit that conducts superimposing fixing and forming a laminate almost simultaneously. Therefore the heat pressing unit conducts the process E. In an alternative exemplary embodiment in order to conduct each process separately the apparatus may comprise instead of the heat pressing unit an superimposing unit that superimposes the recording medium on the intermediate transfer film a fixing unit that fixes the toner image by application of heat and pressure and a laminate forming unit that laminates the intermediate transfer film on the recording medium by application of heat and pressure.

The image forming apparatus according to an aspect of the invention may further comprise other units used in conventional image forming apparatuses such as a cleaning unit such as a cleaning blade that cleans the surface of the image carrier. More preferably the image forming apparatus further comprises a temporary fixing unit that prefixes the toner image which has been transferred onto the intermediate transfer film surface by the transfer unit by preheating with the heat pressing unit before fixing. The image forming apparatus may also have as necessary a preheating unit that preheats the recording medium before the recording medium is superimposed on the intermediate transfer film to bring the transferred toner image into contact with the recording medium.

Hereinafter the configuration of the image forming apparatus according to an aspect of the invention will be described with reference to drawings.

The image forming apparatus is a so called tandem apparatus having in the chassis four image forming sections K C M and Y that form toner images in black K cyan C magenta M and yellow Y respectively. The image forming sections K C M and Y are disposed at a constant interval in this order from the tension roll side to the tension roll side. The image forming sections K C M and Y are on the opposite side of the intermediate transfer film to the side having tension rolls and thereon and are disposed along the intermediate transfer film which is stretched vertically between the tension rolls and .

Although the four image forming sections K C M and Y have the same configuration except that the colors of the toner images to be formed are respectively black K cyan C magenta M and yellow Y in the present exemplary embodiment the configuration of the image forming section for a particular color may be altered from the others according to the frequency of use or the like. For example in an exemplary embodiment the diameter of the photoreceptor drum of a more frequently used image forming section is enlarged or the surface material of the photoreceptor can be changed to a material with higher durability so that the lifetime of the system is elongated.

A feed roll that feeds the belt shaped long intermediate transfer film a winding roll that winds the intermediate transfer film fed from the feed roll and four rolls that stretch the intermediate transfer film between the feed roll and the winding roll tension roll tension roll heating roll and peeling roll are also contained in the chassis . The winding roll is connected to a driving source not shown in the Figure and can wind the intermediate transfer film .

One terminal of the intermediate transfer film is wound around the feed roll . The intermediate transfer film is fed from the feed roll sequentially at image formation. The intermediate transfer film wound around the feed roll has its image receiving layer side facing outward. The intermediate transfer film fed from the feed roll is sequentially wound around the winding roll in the direction indicated by an arrow B during image formation.

The intermediate transfer film between the feed roll and the winding roll is in contact with the base material side of the intermediate transfer film and is stretched at a predetermined tension by the tension roll tension roll heating roll and peeling roll disposed in that order from the feed roll to the winding roll .

The heating roll contains a heat source . A pressure roll is disposed to press the heating roll with the intermediate transfer film therebetween. The heating roll and the pressure roll constitute the heat pressing unit. A sheet shaped recording medium cut into a predetermined size which is fed by a conveying unit from a recording medium feeding tray placed outside the chassis not shown in the Figure in the direction indicated by an arrow C horizontal direction can pass through the portion between the pressure roll and the intermediate transfer film nip portion . When the recording medium passes the nip portion the recording medium and the intermediate transfer film are stacked and almost at the same time the toner image is fixed and a lamination is formed.

The pressure roll may be retractably configured such that the pressure roll comes into pressure contact with the heating roll at a predetermined timing. In an exemplary embodiment the pressure roll is retracted to the stand by position so that the heating roll and the pressure roll are separated from each other when toner images in the respective colors are formed on the intermediate transfer film and the pressure roll is moved to a position at which the pressure roll presses the heating roll at the time the recording medium is fed from the recording medium feeding tray to the heat pressing unit after completion of the color toner image formation on the intermediate transfer film . The pressure roll may be configured to have a heat source inside. The heat pressing unit may be a heat roll fixing device used in a conventional image forming apparatuses.

A small diameter peeling roll as the peeling unit is disposed on the heating roll side of the feeding path for the recording medium. The peeling roll is located at the recording medium discharging side of the heat pressing unit. The winding roll disposed such that the intermediate transfer film stretched between the winding roll and the peeling roll is at an angle of approximately 70 relative to traveling direction for the recording medium. In such a case when a rigid recording medium such as a plastic sheet is used a pulling force is applied to the base material side of the laminate formed by the heat pressing unit while the recording medium itself is hard to deform owing to its rigidity even when pulled toward the base material side. Therefore peeling occurs between the image receiving layer and the base material. If the rigidity of the recording medium is small deformation of the recording medium toward the base material side can be prevented for example by sucking the recording medium side of the laminate.

The peeling unit may be a peeling blade that is inserted between the image receiving layer and the base material of the laminated film or a combination of the peeling blade and the peeling roll described above.

Hereinafter a specific configuration of the four image forming sections will be described taking the image forming section Y as a specific example. The image forming section Y has a photoreceptor Y a primary charger Y an LED array Y and a developing device Y. The photoreceptor Y is in contact with the image receiving layer side of the intermediate transfer film and is rotationally driven by a driving unit not shown in the Figure at a predetermined speed along the direction indicated by an arrow A. In addition a primary charger Y an LED array Y a developing device Y and an electrification roll Y are disposed in that order on the circumference of the photoreceptor Y along the direction indicated by the arrow A. An electrification roll Y is disposed to face the photoreceptor Y with the intermediate transfer film therebetween.

The photoreceptor Y is not particularly limited and may be selected from known photoreceptor drums. The photoreceptor Y may have a single layer structure or a multi layer structure whose layers have separate functions. The material of the photoreceptor Y may be an inorganic material such as selenium or amorphous silicon or an organic material.

The developing device Y forms an insulating color toner image on the photoreceptor Y Any known developing device that satisfies this purpose may be used. Examples of such devices include known developing devices that deposit toner on an electrophotographic photoreceptor by using Corotron brush or the like. As an alternative the developing device Y may form a toner image on the photoreceptor Y by using a toner that is mixed with a known carrier and charged. For example known devices such as that described in JP A No. 63 58374 may be used. Yet alternatively a color image may be formed by using a developing device that uses a one component developer not using a carrier.

The color toner used in the developing device Y is insulating particles containing at least a binder resin and a colorant. A yellow toner is used in the developing device Y and cyan magenta and black toners are used in the developing devices of the other image forming sections. The composition average diameter and others of the color toners are selected appropriately from the ranges of the common known toners.

First the surface of the photoreceptor Y is charged uniformly to a predetermined electric potential by a primary charger Y such as an electrification roll. Thereafter the surface of the photoreceptor Y is exposed to light emitted from the LED array Y according to the half tone image raster data corresponding to an input image signal so that an electrostatic latent image is formed. The electrostatic latent image formed on the photoreceptor Y is developed by the developing device Y as the developing unit containing a toner in the corresponding color so that a yellow Y colored toner image is formed. The yellow Y colored toner image is transferred from the photoreceptor Y surface onto the intermediate transfer film surface by the electrification roll Y as the primary transfer unit in the contact area between the photoreceptor Y and the intermediate transfer film . The surface of the photoreceptor Y after completion of the transfer is cleaned as needed by a cleaning device not shown in the Figure so as to remove residual toner and the like. The same toner image formation is conducted in the other image forming sections K C and M except that the color of the toner to be used is different.

The toner images in the respective colors thus formed in the image forming sections K C M and Y are sequentially subjected to primary transfer onto the intermediate transfer film by the electrification rolls K C M and Y as primary transfer units in the order of black cyan magenta and yellow such that the toner images in the respective colors are stacked. As a result a color toner image is formed on the intermediate transfer film .

The stack of the toner images in the four colors transferred onto the surface of the intermediate transfer film is further conveyed in the direction indicated by the arrow B toward the position of the heat pressing unit. At the nip portion the toner images are fixed as well as the intermediate transfer film is laminated on the recording medium. After passing through the nip portion the base material of the laminate is peeled off the image receiving layer by the peeling roll . The recording medium whose entire image forming surface is covered with the image receiving layer is discharged to outside of the chassis by a conveying unit not shown in the Figure . On the other hand only the base material region of the intermediate transfer film is wound around the winding roll .

In this way it is possible to obtain uniform glossiness on the entire image forming surface regardless of the kind of the recording medium used in image formation. In the image forming apparatus shown in generation of toner offset can also be prevented since the heating roll does directly contact with the toner image. If the recording medium used for image formation has been cut into the size of the final product recording media having images thereon can be produced in large quantity at high speed without cutting the recording media after image formation.

When the fixing and the forming of a laminate are conducted by the heat pressing unit after the toner images are transferred and stacked on the intermediate transfer film image deterioration and irregular registration may occur. In order to prevent occurrence of such problems it is possible to install a temporary fixing unit that temporarily fix the toner image on the intermediate transfer film stretched between the tension roll and the heating roll . As the temporary fixing unit it is possible to install a contact or non contact heating unit on the base material side and or the image receiving layer side of the intermediate transfer film stretched between the tension roll and the heating roll . For example a heating roll for temporary fixing may be disposed such that the heating roll contacts the base material side of the intermediate transfer film .

On the other hand the apparatus shown in FIG. 3 of JP A No. 2005 227377 is an example of conventional image forming apparatuses that form an image on an intermediate transfer film having an image receiving layer laminate it on a recording medium and then peel the intermediate transfer film off the recording medium to transfer only the image onto the recording medium.

Use of such an apparatus enables easy image formation on a recording medium such as plastic sheet. However the glossiness on the image forming surface becomes uneven since the image region and the non image region are not covered with the image receiving layer. In a mass production of recording media cut into a predetermined size having an image formed thereon it has been necessary to form an image and conduct forming of a laminate and peeling by using a large sized intermediate transfer film and recording medium up to approximately 320 450 mm and then cut the large sized recording medium having the image formed thereon into pieces of a predetermined size. In addition a positioning unit is required upon stacking the recording medium and the intermediate transfer film before forming of a laminate and a heating unit for forming of a laminate is required in addition to the heating unit for fixing the image whereby the production steps and the apparatus tend to be more complicated.

However the image forming apparatus according to an aspect of the invention shown in can overcome all of the problems above.

Hereinafter another embodiment of the image forming apparatus according to an aspect of the invention will be described with reference to drawings.

The image forming apparatus shown in uses a belt shaped recording medium as the recording medium and a recording medium feed roll is installed instead of the recording medium feeding tray in the image forming apparatus shown in and also a recording medium winding roll connected to a driving source not shown in Figure is installed to the recording medium discharging side of the heat pressing unit. The recording medium is stretched by the recording medium feed roll and the recording medium winding roll so that it passes through between the pressure roll and the intermediate transfer film . The image formation is carried out while the recording medium is sequentially wound around the recording medium winding roll .

In this way uniform glossiness in the entire image forming surface can be achieved regardless of the kind of the recording medium used in image formation. In the image forming apparatus shown in occurrence of toner offset can also be prevented since the heating roll does not directly contact with the toner image. It is also possible to obtain a recording medium having a belt shaped image formed thereon. A temporary fixing unit may be provided in the image forming apparatus shown in similarly to the image forming apparatus shown in .

Yet another exemplary embodiment of the image forming apparatus according to an aspect of the invention will be described with reference to drawings.

The image forming apparatus shown in is obtained by providing a preheating unit on the traveling route for the recording medium from the recording medium feeding tray to the heat pressing unit having the heating roll and pressure roll in the image forming apparatus shown in .

The preheating unit comprises a heating roll containing a heat source and a pressure roll facing the heating roll . The recording medium is preheated by being passed through between the heating roll and the pressure roll in the direction indicated by an arrow C during image formation. A known fixing device may be used as the preheating unit having a pair of rolls.

By using the image forming apparatus shown in fixing defects can be prevented easily even when a thick recording medium having a larger heat capacity is used. This is because the recording medium is conveyed to the heat pressing unit and the image is fixed after the recording medium is preheated by the preheating unit.

In addition to the elements described above the image forming apparatus according to an aspect of the invention may further comprise a cooling unit that cools the laminate after heating and pressing by the heat pressing unit so that the cooling process described above can be conducted as necessary. The cooling unit comprises at least a pair of members whose surfaces facing each other are planar. The cooling of the laminate with the cooling unit is conducted while the laminate is sandwiched between the pair of members.

The pair of members refers to members having a function of cooling the laminate by removing heat from the heated laminate while the shape of the laminate is maintained flat through direct or indirect contact with the laminate at the time of the cooling of the laminate. The pair of members may be simple plate shaped members or belts that form flat surfaces by being stretched by rolls. The pair of members may consist of a material having high thermal conductance and may have a structure having high heat radiation property. For example members made of a metal having a heat radiation fin or a liquid cooling mechanism can be utilized. The cooling unit may have an air cooling fan or the like for facilitating the cooling of the pair of members which receive heat from the laminate.

An image forming apparatus having the cooling unit may have a device that has at least the functions of the heat pressing unit and the cooling unit.

The device having at least the functions of the heat pressing unit and the cooling unit may be a device that comprises at least 

a heating roll that contacts a surface of the intermediate transfer film at a side at which the base material is provided and stretches the intermediate transfer film 

a pressure roll that stretches the endless belt and is located to face the heating roll such that the intermediate transfer film and the endless belt come into pressure contact with each other to form a pressure contact region 

a tension roll that stretches the endless belt together with the pressure roll such that the outer surface of the endless belt faces the surface of the intermediate transfer film at the image receiving layer side the intermediate transfer film being conveyed toward the downstream direction of the rotation direction of the heating roll and

a pair of cooling members respectively contacting a surface of the intermediate transfer film at a side at which the base material is provided and the inner surface of the endless belt such that the intermediate transfer film and the endless belt come into pressure contact with each other along the region at which a surface of the intermediate transfer film at a side at which the image receiving layer is provided and the outer surface of the endless belt face each other wherein the surfaces of the cooling member respectively contacting the surface of the intermediate transfer film at the side at which the base material is provided and the inner surface of the endless belt are planar. The pressure roll may have a heat source inside so that the pressure roll has also a function as the heating roll.

Image forming apparatus shown in has the above structure in which the heat pressing unit heating roll and pressure roll of image forming apparatus shown in is modified to have an additional function as the cooling unit. Since tension roll is disposed to face peeling roll the portion composed of heating roll pressure roll tension roll endless belt pair of cooling members and peeling roll has a substantially integrated structure and has also the function as the peeling unit in addition to the functions as the heat pressing unit and the cooling unit.

Each of cooling members consists of a metal plate equipped with a cooling fin not shown . The cooling members are disposed to press endless belt and intermediate transfer film provided between the cooling members from both sides by pressure contact elements not shown . Further an air cooling fan not shown is provided near cooling members in order to heighten the heat radiation efficiency of pair of cooling members . When heating roll and pressure roll are retractable pair of cooling members may be configured to be retractable in synchronization with pair of rolls and .

In image forming apparatus shown in the laminate formed during passage between heating roll and pressure roll is conveyed to a region between cooling members by endless belt . When passing through the region the laminate is pressed from both sides by cooling members so that the heat of the laminate is transferred to cooling members and thus the laminate is cooled sufficiently while maintaining the flat shape. The transfer of the heat from the laminate to cooling members may be direct heat transfer or may be indirect heat transfer via endless belt . Thereafter the laminate is transferred to a region between tension roll and peeling roll .

When image forming apparatus shown in is used the formation of the laminate by application of heat and pressure the cooling of the laminate and the peeling at the interface between the base material and the image receiving layer in the laminate can be conducted successively and efficiently therefore plastic cards without deformation can be produced efficiently even when a plastic film that is easily deformed by heat is used as the recording medium or when the fixing is conducted at a high fixing temperature.

In Example 4 a base material is used in which the surface that has been subjected to releasability imparting treatment has a surface roughness center line average roughness Ra of 20 m and the entire image forming surface is matte finished. In contrast in Examples 1 to 3 and 5 to 20 in which the surface roughness center line average roughness Ra of the base material is several m or less it is possible to make the entire image forming surface highly glossy or relatively highly glossy.

As for the samples of Examples 1 to 3 obtained by using an intermediate transfer film having a base material with a smooth surface and having an image forming surface that is not matte finished the residual air that remains in the image forming surface due to the irregularity of the surface of the recording medium is evaluated. The results are shown in Table 1.

The residual air is evaluated by visual observation. The evaluation criteria for the results shown in Table 1 are as follows 

The results of the evaluation on the difference in fixability caused by the presence of absence of preheating determined by using the samples of Examples 1 and 5 are shown in the following Table 2.

The fixability shown in Table 2 is evaluated by the following method An X shaped scar with a length of approximately 40 mm that penetrates the image to the base material of the recording medium is formed in the image region of the recording medium with a cutter knife a mending tape 810 manufactured by Sumitomo 3M is placed thereon pressed sufficiently to be adhered and 2 minutes later the mending tape is peeled off instantaneously in the vertical direction. Evaluation criteria for the results shown in Table 2 are as follows 

The image elongation in relation to the thickness and material of the base material is evaluated using the samples of Examples 6 to 20. The results are shown in the following Table 3.

The image elongation shown in Table 3 is determined as an elongation ratio of the image formed by using the base material described in each Example taking a line of 20 mm in a circumferential direction in the image transferred from a PET film having a thickness of 100 m which does not normally elongate as the standard. Evaluation criteria for the results shown in Table 3 are as follows 

Ten plastic cards are produced continuously in the same manner as in Example 1 except that i the recording medium used in Example 1 is replaced with a PETG sheet DIAFIX WHI manufactured by Mitsubishi Plastics Inc. having a glass transition temperature of 57.degree. C. having a thickness of 760.mu.m which has been punched into a card size 85.6 mm.times.54 mm in advance ii the apparatus having a structure shown in is used in place of the apparatus shown in iii the temperature of the heat pressing unit is set to 180.degree. C. and iv the feeding velocity of the intermediate transfer film is set to 25 mm s. Cards produced after the temperature inside the apparatus becomes almost constant are used as the cards for evaluation.

The apparatus used for evaluation has a configuration comprising an apparatus having a structure shown in Table 1 used in Example 1 to which a cooling unit including tension roll endless belt and a pair of cooling members is added.

In the configuration endless belt is a belt having a thickness of 0.3 mm and a width of 60 mm comprising a polyimide substrate and a silicone rubber layer provided on the outer surface of the polyimide substrate. Cooling members are each a metal plate made of aluminum having a thickness of 5 mm a width of 80 mm and a length of 40 mm. One surface of the metal plate is a flat plane and the other surface has a heat radiation fin. Two small cooling fans having a propeller with a diameter of 40 mm are provided on the surface of the metal plate which surface is at a side at which the heat radiation fin is provided.

Ten plastic cards are continuously produced in the same manner as in Example 21 except that the same apparatus as that used in Example 1 is used for evaluation. The settings of the temperature of the heat pressing unit and the feeding velocity of the intermediate transfer film are the same as in Example 21. Cards produced after the temperature inside the apparatus becomes almost constant are used as the cards for evaluation.

Ten plastic cards obtained in Example 21 and ten plastic cards obtained in Example 22 are placed on a level block. The occurrence and degree of deformation of the plastic cards are observed visually and are evaluated according to the following criteria. The results are shown in Table 4.

B A very minute gap is observed between the level block and some of the plastic cards. However the distance between the surface of the plastic cards and the level block is less than 1.5 mm at every portion and there is no practical problem.

C A gap is observed between the level block and some or all of the plastic cards. Moreover deformation that gives a distance of more than 1.5 mm between the plastic cards and the level block is observed and there is a practical problem.
