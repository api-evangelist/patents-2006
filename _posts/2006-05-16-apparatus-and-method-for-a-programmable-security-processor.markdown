This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09 565 655 filed on May 5 2000 which claims priority to the provisional application bearing Ser. No. 60 133 131 filed on May 7 1999. Each of the aforementioned prior application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention relates generally to communication systems. More particularly this invention relates to a programmable reconfigurable security processor for an electronic communication device.

Traditionally electronic communication devices have been designed to perform a single function according to a single standard or application. As the sophistication of electronic communication devices increases it is possible to design electronic devices that can perform multiple functions according to multiple standards or applications. The licensing or authorization of a product that performs according to a single standard is straightforward since a license can be assigned to the product when it is sold. On the other hand it is relatively difficult to provide a proper license or authorization to a device that operates according to multiple standards or applications.

In view of the foregoing it would be highly desirable to provide a mechanism to operate an electronic communication device according to multiple standards or applications wherein each standard is executed pursuant to proper authorization.

In one embodiment of the invention a programmable reconfigurable security processor enables an electronic communication device to operate according to multiple standards or to accommodate multiple applications wherein each standard or application is executed pursuant to proper authorization. The programmable reconfigurable security processor can be exploited in any device in which different applications algorithms routines or utilities may be loaded at or prior to run time. For example the security processor can be used to control licenses to intellectual property to enable new standards applications system upgrades and trial periods. Furthermore the security processor can perform real time encryption and or decryption of information streams. This embodiment of the invention can be successfully exploited in multi mode products such as multi mode wireless telephones information terminals encryption equipment and image and multimedia manipulation devices.

In a second embodiment of the invention a digital logic circuit comprises a programmable logic device and a programmable security circuit. The programmable security circuit stores a set of authorized configuration security keys. The programmable security circuit compares the authorized configuration security keys with an incoming configuration request and selectively enables a new configuration for the programmable logic device in response to the configuration request.

In another exemplary embodiment the programmable security circuit also stores a set of authorized operation security keys. The programmable security circuit compares the authorized operation security keys with an incoming operation request from the programmable logic device and selectively enables an operation within the programmable logic device in response to the operation request.

The security algorithm s capabilities are categorized for example as open standard manufacturer specific or proprietary. Further the capabilities also include an installation procedure . Regulatory parameters specifications include for example the source of the security algorithm and definition of additional certification . Using information contained in the header installation can proceed based on vendor specified application program interfaces APIs and a virtual machine interface VMI . The VMI is essentially a software programmer s interface to the available hardware resources .

The programmable reconfigurable security processor can be employed to perform various functionality for example 1 to perform encryption decryption of data and 2 to perform encryption decryption of configuration information. and illustrate the first exemplary functionality and and illustrate the second exemplary functionality.

Operations of reconfigurable data transformation unit are controlled by two mechanisms namely the input and control signal and a sequence control signal . Prior to run time the input and control signal configures operations and constants to be used during an operation. During run time the sequence control signal from the microsequencer determines the micro operation sequence. The reconfigurable data transformation unit operations are optimized for computing encryption decryption rounds. Operations include but are not limited to XOR shift right shift left rotate right rotate left bit serial multiple substitution permutation and signal swap.

The operand memory accepts data input from signal set which is a subset of the signal set in . Data is fetched from memory according to a signal from the microsequencer . Fetched data is passed to the reconfigurable data transformation unit via a bi directional signal to be transformed according to the current configuration and the programmed sequence. The transformed data is either returned to the operand memory via the bi directional signal or transferred out of the reconfigurable data transformation unit via a signal set which is a subset of the signal set in .

In an exemplary embodiment the microsequencer is programmed to perform multiple rounds thus increasing the number of transformations executable by a single kernel . In another exemplary embodiment the microsequencer is programmed to execute multiple cycles on an input wider than is provided by the signal set thus effectively increasing the encryption decryption word width. Alternatively the same effect and benefit of programming a kernel to execute multiple cycles can be realized by concatenating adjacent kernels until the desired word width is obtained. Concatentaion consumes more resources but reduces the time to accomplish the same number of transformations.

In another exemplary embodiment cascaded kernels can effectively implement consecutive rounds thereby decreasing overall latency. Moreover cascaded kernels may be used to implement more complex algorithms such as encrypt decrypt encrypt.

In an exemplary embodiment the programmable security circuit operates in two modes. In a first mode the programmable security circuit provides authentication for new configurations of the programmable logic device . In a second mode the programmable security circuit provides authentication for selected operations to be performed by the programmable logic device .

A security request and read back line is used to program a set of security keys into the programmable security circuit . Each security key specifies a permitted programmable logic device configuration or programmable logic device operation.

After the programmable security circuit is programmed the security request and read back line may be used to query the programmable security circuit to determine whether the programmable logic device can assume a new configuration. The programmable device also includes an external configuration data input line which provides new configurations to the programmable logic device a permission line which transfers new configuration to the programmable logic device when such new configuration is permitted or sends an enable signal to the programmable logic device when permission is granted by the programmable security circuit for requested operation and an internal operation input line which passes requests from the programmable logic device to the programmable security circuit to perform operations.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the invention can be successfully exploited in any device in which different data algorithms routines or utilities may be loaded at run time. For example the invention is useful in controlling licenses to intellectual property such as for enabling new standards system upgrades and trial periods. Thus the invention can be successfully exploited in multi mode products such as multi mode wireless telephones encryption equipment and image manipulation devices.

The foregoing examples illustrate certain exemplary embodiments of the invention from which other embodiments variations and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The invention should therefore not be limited to the particular embodiments discussed above but rather is defined by the following claims.
