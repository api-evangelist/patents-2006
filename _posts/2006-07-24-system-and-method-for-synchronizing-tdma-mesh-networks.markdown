The present invention relates to the field of communications and more particularly to communications over mesh networks.

Mesh networking routes data voice and instructions between nodes and allows for continuous connections and reconfiguration around blocked paths by hopping from one node to another node until a successful connection is established. Even if a node collapses or a connection is bad the mesh network still operates whether the network is wireless wired and software interacted. This allows an inexpensive peer network node to supply back haul services to other nodes in the same network and extend the mesh network by sharing access to a higher cost network infrastructure.

Wireless mesh networking is implemented over a wireless local area network using wireless nodes. This type of mesh network is decentralized and often operates in an ad hoc manner. The wireless nodes operate as repeaters and transmit data from nearby wireless nodes to other peers forming a mesh network that spans large distances. In ad hoc networking neighbors find another route when a node is dropped. Nodes can be either fixed or mobile with mobile devices forming a mobile ad hoc network MANET known to those skilled in the art.

The mesh networks use dynamic routing capabilities. A routing algorithm ensures that data takes an appropriate and typically the fastest route to a destination. Some mobile mesh networks could include multiple fixed base stations with cut through high bandwidth terrestrial links operating as gateways to fixed base stations or other services including the internet. It is possible to extend the mesh network with only a minimal base station infrastructure. There are also many different types of protocols that can be used in a mesh network for example an Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector AODV Dynamic Source Routing DSR Optimized Link State Routing protocol OLSR and Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm TORA as non limiting examples.

Many of the mesh networks operate using a Time Division Multiple Access TDMA protocol. Depending on the configuration of a TDMA mesh network a large portion or even a majority of the configured bandwidth can be wasted. Many of the mesh networks use a primary frequency for a beacon interval operative as a network control interval and a plurality sometimes four or more of secondary frequencies for a digital data DD interval. Many of the secondary frequencies can be unused and thus as noted before a large portion or even a majority of the configured bandwidth can be wasted.

A communications system includes a plurality of Time Division Multiple Access TDMA mesh networks. Each comprises a plurality of wireless nodes. Each plurality of wireless nodes within a respective TDMA mesh network comprises a transmitter and receiver that communicate on a primary and at least one secondary frequency and use a TDMA epoch that is divided into at least a beacon interval using the primary frequency and a digital data interval using both the primary and secondary frequencies. The wireless nodes are synchronized to each other such that the start of TDMA epochs for each TDMA mesh network overlap and have the same TDMA epoch duration or an integer multiple thereof.

In yet another aspect a gateway wireless node is common to the TDMA mesh networks and is operative for transmitting beacons for each TDMA mesh network that do not conflict with each other. A gateway wireless node further comprises a transmitter that transmits a separate beacon for each of the TDMA mesh networks of which it is a member. A phantom node can also be common for the TDMA mesh networks and whose start of a TDMA epoch in a TDMA mesh network is at a desired offset based upon an inferred start of a TDMA epoch of one of the other TDMA mesh networks.

In yet another aspect the beacon interval within a TDMA mesh network falls within the digital data interval of another TDMA mesh network such that the beacon transmissions of each TDMA mesh network do not collide. A channel reservation can be established for a beacon interval during a digital data interval and corresponding to another TMDA mesh network s beacon interval to prevent any wireless nodes from making digital data transmissions or beacon transmissions that collide with the beacon transmissions from another TDMA mesh network. It is also possible to form the beacon interval of a TDMA mesh network to fall within the digital data interval and a digital voice interval of another TDMA mesh network.

Different embodiments will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments are shown. Many different forms can be set forth and described embodiments should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope to those skilled in the art.

In accordance with a non limiting example of the present invention channel wastage can be overcome in a TDMA mesh network communications system by recognizing that a second TDMA mesh network in a non limiting example can use the unused TDMA secondary frequencies in a first TDMA mesh network for secondary frequency digital data usage. In effect the system and method can scavenge a part of the secondary frequency channels unused by the first TDMA mesh network thereby reducing channel wastage.

An example of a communications system that can be used and modified for use with the present invention is now set forth with regard to .

An example of a radio that could be used with such system and method is a Falcon III radio manufactured and sold by Harris Corporation of Melbourne Fla. It should be understood that different radios can be used including software defined radios that can be typically implemented with relatively standard processor and hardware components. One particular class of software radio is the Joint Tactical Radio JTR which includes relatively standard radio and processing hardware along with any appropriate waveform software modules to implement the communication waveforms a radio will use. JTR radios also use operating system software that conforms with the software communications architecture SCA specification see www.jtrs.saalt.mil which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The SCA is an open architecture framework that specifies how hardware and software components are to interoperate so that different manufacturers and developers can readily integrate the respective components into a single device.

The Joint Tactical Radio System JTRS Software Component Architecture SCA defines a set of interfaces and protocols often based on the Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA for implementing a Software Defined Radio SDR . In part JTRS and its SCA are used with a family of software re programmable radios. As such the SCA is a specific set of rules methods and design criteria for implementing software re programmable digital radios.

The JTRS SCA specification is published by the JTRS Joint Program Office JPO . The JTRS SCA has been structured to provide for portability of applications software between different JTRS SCA implementations leverage commercial standards to reduce development cost reduce development time of new waveforms through the ability to reuse design modules and build on evolving commercial frameworks and architectures.

The JTRS SCA is not a system specification as it is intended to be implementation independent but a set of rules that constrain the design of systems to achieve desired JTRS objectives. The software framework of the JTRS SCA defines the Operating Environment OE and specifies the services and interfaces that applications use from that environment. The SCA OE comprises a Core Framework CF a CORBA middleware and an Operating System OS based on the Portable Operating System Interface POSIX with associated board support packages. The JTRS SCA also provides a building block structure defined in the API Supplement for defining application programming interfaces APIs between application software components.

The JTRS SCA Core Framework CF is an architectural concept defining the essential core set of open software Interfaces and Profiles that provide for the deployment management interconnection and intercommunication of software application components in embedded distributed computing communication systems. Interfaces may be defined in the JTRS SCA Specification. However developers may implement some of them some may be implemented by non core applications i.e. waveforms etc. and some may be implemented by hardware device providers.

For purposes of description only a brief description of an example of a communications system that could incorporate the bandwidth scavenging in accordance with non limiting examples of the present invention is described relative to a non limiting example shown in . This high level block diagram of a communications system includes a base station segment and wireless message terminals that could be modified for use with the present invention. The base station segment includes a VHF radio and HF radio that communicate and transmit voice or data over a wireless link to a VHF net or HF net each which include a number of respective VHF radios and HF radios and personal computer workstations connected to the radios . Ad hoc communication networks are interoperative with the various components as illustrated. Thus it should be understood that the HF or VHF networks include HF and VHF net segments that are infrastructure less and operative as the ad hoc communications network. Although UHF radios and net segments are not illustrated these could be included.

It is also possible to use a fixed non adaptive data rate as high as 19 200 bps with a radio set to ISB mode and an HF modem set to a fixed data rate. It is possible to use code combining techniques and ARQ.

There now follows a more detailed description of at least one non limiting example of the bandwidth scavenging of the present invention It should be understood that many of the mesh networks operate using a Time Division Multiple Access TDMA protocol. Depending on the configuration of a TDMA mesh network a large portion or even a majority of configured bandwidth can be wasted. This can be true even when considering a maximum possible theoretical channel utilization.

TDMA mesh networks typically include a plurality of wireless nodes that communicate with each other using primary and secondary frequencies and using TDMA epochs that are divided into a beacon interval operative as a network control interval sometimes a digital voice DV interval and a digital data DD interval. For purposes of this description TDMA mesh networks use a slot of channel time that is allocated prior to a node actually transmitting data during the allocated slot. Details of how the TDMA channel allocation mechanism works is not described in detail because it is sufficient that some algorithm is used to allocate a potentially recurring slot of channel time in which a particular node may transmit the data. TDMA channel time allocation algorithms typically segment channel time into blocks. Each block is an epoch. Blocks are subdivided into slots used by nodes to transmit data. It is assumed that the data to be transmitted constitutes an isochronous stream meaning that large portions of data are repeatedly generated and presented at the source node for delivery to the destination node. The data is typically time dependent and must be delivered within certain time constraints. Multiple frequencies can be allocated to a single TDMA mesh network using a primary frequency and a plurality of or more secondary frequencies sometimes up to four secondary frequencies in non limiting examples.

As shown in for a TDMA mesh network only the digital data interval actually uses some of the secondary frequencies. All secondary frequencies during the beacon and digital voice intervals are unused. These unused portions of allocated frequencies can be referred to as wasted channel time or more simply as channel wastage. Depending upon the relative sizes of the beacon digital voice and digital data intervals and how many secondary frequencies are allocated a majority of allocated bandwidth can consist of channel wastage.

Of course it is possible to configure TDMA mesh networks to minimize channel wastage. For example a TDMA mesh network could be configured using only the primary frequency and no secondary frequencies resulting in no channel wastage. Whenever any secondary frequencies are allocated however channel wastage occurs. Even in this case channel wastage can be minimized by maximizing the relative size of the digital data interval at the expense of any beacon and digital voice interval sizes. Unfortunately there are practical constraints limiting how much channel wastage can be limited.

Beacon interval size is typically dictated by the number of nodes in the TDMA mesh network for example typically wireless nodes and often mobile or fixed nodes as in a mobile ad hoc network MANET . More nodes mean a larger beacon interval. Digital voice or video interval size is dictated by the expected peak requirement for simultaneous digital voice and video services. These digital voice and video intervals can usually be reduced below an expected peak need at the cost of failing to provision the peak need at the likely cost of the digital voice or video failing to work exactly when it is most needed by the user in the field.

The solution to channel wastage is achieved by recognizing that a second TDMA mesh network for example termed Net in can use the unused TDMA portions of the first Net TDMA mesh network s secondary frequencies for its secondary frequency digital data usage. In effect the system can scavenge a part of the secondary frequency channels unused by the first TDMA mesh network thereby reducing channel wastage.

An example of the bandwidth scavenging as described is shown in . For example a sixth frequency f is allocated and used as the primary frequency for the second TDMA mesh network. Its start of epoch is offset from the start of epoch for the first TDMA mesh network such that the digital data secondary frequency TDMA usage for the second TDMA mesh network falls in the unused parts of the secondary frequency usage map of the first TDMA mesh network. In this non limiting example channel wastage has been reduced by about 50 .

In accordance with non limiting examples of the present invention bandwidth scavenging as described requires several functions as follows 

2. Offset the start of epoch for the second TDMA mesh network from the start of epoch for the first TDMA mesh network so that the secondary frequency usage of the second TDMA mesh network falls in the unused portion of the secondary frequency usage map of the first TDMA mesh network and

Allocating a new currently unused frequency such as the primary frequency number 1 above can be done during the TDMA mesh network s initial configuration or can be accomplished automatically via a configuration allowing automatic bandwidth scavenging in accordance with non limiting examples of the present invention.

Establishing the initial start of epoch offset number 2 above can be accomplished with minimal steps. When a TDMA mesh network e.g. the second TDMA mesh network hears another mesh network e.g. the first TDMA mesh network with which it wishes to perform bandwidth scavenging those radios or wireless nodes for the second TDMA mesh network that hear the radios or wireless nodes in the first TDMA mesh network create an artificial or phantom radio or node whose start of epoch is at the desired offset based upon the inferred start of epoch for the first TDMA mesh network. This phantom node is included in the second TDMA mesh network node s network synchronization algorithm i.e. epoch synchronization beacon synchronization or smoothing algorithm. The effect of including this phantom node is to gradually and systematically move the second TDMA mesh network s start of epoch to the desired offset. Other algorithms to establish the initial start of epoch offset are also possible.

Maintaining a start of epoch offset after the offset was first accomplished number 2 listed above also takes minimal steps. The phantom nodes in the network synchronization algorithm can be continued.

The bandwidth scavenging algorithm as described is flexible regardless of the configuration of the overlapping TDMA mesh network. This is because during the beacon interval only the primary frequency can be used by a TDMA mesh network. Thus the beacon interval portion of the TDMA mesh network s secondary frequency map is usually available for use by other TDMA mesh networks. As a result the bandwidth scavenging as described can be used even when the overlapping TDMA mesh network s digital voice interval has been eliminated.

Extensions of this type of system are also possible. As part of its coexistence configuration a TDMA mesh network can be configured to shift automatically to bandwidth scavenging as described when encountering another TDMA mesh network either to expand its effective bandwidth or to conserve the overall used bandwidth.

Another extension is to use bandwidth scavenging to overlap more than two TDMA mesh networks. An example of this for three TDMA mesh networks is shown in which shows a chart similar to but now showing a third TDMA mesh network Net which is overlapped by allocating its primary frequency f and aligning this third TDMA mesh network s start of epoch to allow its digital data secondary frequency usage to overlap or fall within the unused portions of the first and second TDMA mesh network s secondary frequency usage maps.

In some examples the available unused secondary frequency gaps are too small to fit the alternate third TDMA mesh network s digital data interval. This is not a serious drawback and possible alternative mechanisms can handle this situation.

 Bandwidth scavenging as described is relevant to many RF communications devices. Multiple secondary frequencies can be used to extend total radio or wireless node bandwidth and use the secondary frequencies during a digital data interval. As a result these frequencies are wasted during digital voice digital video and during beacon intervals. Bandwidth scavenging as described allows any wasted parts of the secondary frequencies to be used when multiple TDMA mesh networks are present.

In accordance with a non limiting example of the present invention a TDMA type scheme is applied in a coarse grained fashion to a TDMA mesh network radio frequency versus time usage characteristics to allow these TDMA mesh networks to scavenge the unused parts of each other s secondary frequencies by offsetting in time each TDMA mesh network s secondary frequency usage with respect to the other s . Bandwidth scavenging in accordance with a non limiting example of the present invention is used in TDMA mesh networks to accomplish reuse of the otherwise wasted parts of wireless nodes or radio s secondary frequencies.

It should be understood that a TDMA mesh network architecture can be formed of different types and a TDMA epoch in a non limiting example as set forth comprises a network control interval as a beacon interval and digital data interval. A network control interval as a plurality of beacons uses only the primary frequency. The digital data interval uses both the primary and secondary frequencies via the TDMA channel allocation.

It is possible to reduce the requirements that any secondary frequency usage interdigitates i.e. be non overlapping. It should be understood that multiple TDMA mesh networks should be synchronized. Non overlapping of secondary frequency usage while desirable and optimal is not strictly required. Thus non overlapping secondary frequency usage could be shown as an example of a more general inter meshing network synchronization.

A phantom node synchronization algorithm in accordance with non limiting examples of the present invention can allow synchronization between and among multiple mobile ad hoc and TDMA mesh networks. Moreover there are several ways bandwidth scavenging could accomplish inter network synchronization. Phantom node synchronization is just one.

A phantom node synchronization algorithm achieves and maintains synchronization between and among multiple mobile ad hoc mesh networks independent from bandwidth scavenging as described above in accordance with non limiting examples of the present invention. As such this type of phantom node synchronization algorithm can be useful not just for bandwidth scavenging inter meshed TDMA mesh network synchronization but also useful when multiple mesh networks should be synchronized for other reasons e.g. to simplify the job of gateway nodes or simplify the coexistence and interoperability of multiple TDMA mesh networks on the same frequency in the same place.

One non limiting example is a gateway between two high performance TDMA mesh networks that typically communicates using a TDMA epoch that has a beacon interval digital voice interval and digital data interval. The gateway node could be a member of both TDMA mesh networks. The gateway node should transmit two beacons one for each of the two TDMA mesh networks. If the two TDMA mesh networks are not synchronized however problems could arise. For example sometimes the beacon transmit times for the two beacon transmissions will overlap. Because it is unattractive cost wise to include two independent radios in the gateway node typically a wireless node the gateway node will be able to transmit one of the two beacons. Moreover even if the gateway did have two independent radios in the one node when both TDMA mesh networks are operating on the same frequency only a single beacon would be transmitted at a time. Otherwise a collision would occur with the result that no node would correctly receive either beacon. With the two overlapping TDMA mesh networks having the same epoch duration or an integer multiple thereof it could be synchronized for simplifying the gateway node s operation. This inter network gateway functionality is an example of interoperability.

Coexistence is another example when the system might want to synchronize the operation of multiple TDMA mesh networks. It is desirable for the beacon interval of each TDMA mesh network to fall within the digital data interval and in some networks the digital voice and or digital data interval of the co located TDMA mesh networks so that each TDMA mesh network s beacon transmissions would not collide with those of the other TDMA mesh networks. A TDMA mesh network could make an artificial reservation during a digital data interval corresponding to the other TDMA mesh networks beacon interval. As a result two TDMA mesh networks prevent any of their nodes from making digital data transmissions or beacon transmissions that would collide with the other TDMA mesh networks beacon transmissions. For a TDMA mesh network to continue to function reliably and robustly many of its beacon transmissions must be correctly received by neighboring nodes in the TDMA mesh network. In this case synchronization is needed such that these artificial TDMA channel reservations are stationary with respect to the other TDMA mesh networks beacon intervals.

 Phantom node synchronization is a simple and robust technique to achieve synchronization and maintain synchronization between potentially multiple TDMA mesh networks completely independent of the reasons why the synchronization is desired.

A problem of minimizing end to end latency is also addressed in accordance with non limiting examples. It should be understood that the time taken by over the air OTA headers inter frame spaces cyclic redundancy checks CRC trailers stuff bits and the like are typically ignored.

Quality of Service QoS parameters are optimized when delivering real time data across a data communications network and typically include end to end latency jitter throughput and reliability. The description as follows focuses on end to end latency.

End to end latency can be defined as the time it takes to deliver a data packet from a source node to a destination node. End to end latency can also be defined as the time duration from when the data packet is presented to the data communications layer of the stack at the source node to when the data packet is passed up from the data communication layer of the stack at the destination node. End to end jitter can be defined as the variance of end to end latency typically expressed as the standard deviation of latency

In a multi hop ad hoc wireless data communications network a packet will in general be transmitted multiple times i.e. take multiple hops as it traverses the network from the source node to the destination node. For purposes of this description TDMA mesh networks use a slot of channel time that is allocated prior to a node actually transmitting data during the allocated slot. Details of how the TDMA channel allocation mechanism works are not described in detail because it is sufficient that some algorithm is used to allocate a recurring slot of channel time in which a particular node may transmit the data TDMA channel time allocation algorithms typically segment channel time into blocks. Each block is an epoch. Blocks are subdivided into slots used by nodes to transmit data. It is assumed that the data to be transmitted constitutes an isochronous stream meaning that large portions of data are repeatedly generated and presented at the source node for delivery to the destination node. The data is typically time dependent and must be delivered within certain time constraints.

For example when a data packet traverses the TDMA mesh network from a source node to a destination node it will be transmitted by some sequence of nodes. For example this sequence consists of nodes A B C and D to destination node E where node A is the source node. For example purposes the system assumes each transmitted data packet is successfully received by each hop s destination node.

The system analyzes hop latencies that fit together along the route traversed with the express Quality of Service QoS algorithm as described to reduce end to end latency. End to end OTA route traversal latency can be substantially reduced by modifying the TDMA channel time allocation algorithm to order the transmission allocation to each node participating in the data stream s route within each TDMA epoch as shown in .

Minimum end to end latency can be achieved when the next hop s TxOp transmission opportunity for the data stream whose latency the system is trying to minimize occurs as soon as possible after the QoS data packet to be relayed is received ideally at the data slot following reception. When viewed as a sequence of TxOps the optimal QoS TxOp sequence consists of a series of adjacent time sequential TxOps in the epoch from the source node to destination node one TxOp for each hop. By paying attention to how hop latencies fit together and then optimally ordering the resulting sequence of channel time allocations within the epoch the end to end latency shown in is reduced to less than half an epoch.

To achieve minimal OTA end to end latency the Express QoS allocation algorithm can order each node s recurring transmission time within the epoch in route traversal sequence i.e. sequentially in the epoch data interval from a source node to a destination node. This provides the majority of end to end OTA latency reduction.

In addition the Express QoS allocation algorithm can place each allocation in the route sequence as close as possible to its neighboring allocations in the route sequence. Though not as important as the ordering of allocated slots this provides some additional reduction in end to end OTA latency and allows longer routes to fit within single epoch.

For Express QoS to be able to reduce end to end latency sufficient channel time i.e. slots should be available and unallocated such that Express QoS has a choice of allocations at multiple nodes along the route. The more slot choices Express QoS has available the more it can minimize end to end latency.

The Express QoS allocation algorithm can coordinate local node channel time allocation across the spatial extent of the source to destination traversal route. This requires some inter node communication. Typically communication between adjacent nodes is required and communication beyond adjacent neighbors along the route is not required.

It should be understood that full duplex operation in wireless TDMA mesh networks is typically achieved by creating two data streams one stream for each direction of travel. Express QoS as described requires a different ordering of channel allocations for each direction since an optimal slot allocation sequence in one direction will be a worst case allocation for the opposite direction.

Express QoS as described can substantially reduce the latency experienced by packets belonging to a QoS data stream flowing across a wireless TDMA multi hop mesh network. This improved QoS latency as described is applicable to demanding QoS sensitive applications such as two way real time voice.

To quantify and characterize the latency improvement that can be expected consider the expected latency of a packet traveling across a wireless TDMKA mesh network of diameter D from one edge of the network to the opposite edge. In all cases at each hop the placement of the transmission slot within the TDMA epoch s digital data interval is entirely dependent upon the details of the operation of the TDMA channel allocation algorithm. Many algorithms are possible. Unless the algorithm explicitly optimizes relative slot positions along the route so as to minimize the latency experienced by packets traversing that route however there is no reason to expect the data packets will achieve an average per hop traversal latency of less than the approximate 0.5 TDMA epochs expected by random slot placement. Using the Express QoS TDMA channel allocation algorithm as described however per hop traversal latency as low as the OTA data transmission time can be achieved provided all allocation can be fit within a single epoch. As shown in using Express QoS as described a data packet can traverse the entire route in less than a single epoch

Express QoS is an extension of the TOMA channel allocation algorithm to minimize end to end latency along a route across a multi hop TDMA mesh network adding a latency minimizing extension to the TDMA algorithm.

It is also possible to use an Optimized Link State Routing OLSR in similar over the air OTA packet data and exchange link state routing algorithms. The OLSR can be adapted to handle multiple waveforms having different radio ranges by running multiple OLRS processes MOP a separate OLSR process in each node for each of the waveforms. Each OLSR process can perform its independent set of HELLO and TC message transmissions using a different waveform. Each OLSR process can build a model of network conductivity based on its waveform s range in the usual OLSR fashion

Each OLSR process can construct a routing table for its waveform s conductivity and a single composite routing table can be build from the collection of waveform routing tables. Composite routing tables can be constructed depending upon what routing criteria or combination of criteria are optimized. The possible routing criteria can be optimized including combinations of a minimum number of hops a minimum end to end latency a maximum data throughput congestion avoidance minimum power consumption a higher reliability such as the fewest dropped packets and a minimum bandwidth used.

It is also possible to reduce the bandwidth and computational expense. Instead of running a parallel OLSR process in each node for each waveform only a single OLSR process is run in each node. This single OLSR process can be modified to exchange a separate and independent set of one hop neighbor HELLO messages for each waveform. The HELLO message could contain only one hop neighborhood information for that waveform. Each node can build a two hop neighborhood for each waveform.

The OLSR state table can be extended to segregate link state information for each one hop neighbor by a waveform. Each node s one hop neighborhood for each waveform can be distributed in a single TC message. This provides each node the information it requires to build its network topology model of connectivity for each waveform. This multi waveform network topology builds its own composite route table. The improvement merges the multiple OLSR processes of MOP into a single OLSR process while keeping independent HELLO messaging for each waveform. Instead of transmitting separate TC messages for each waveform every waveform s one hop neighborhood is included in a single TC message. The bandwidth consumed is significantly reduced along with the computational and memory burdens of a separate OLSR process per waveform and processing of separate TC message data streams for each waveform.

Also OLSR messages can be transmitted using only a base waveform that may or may not be the longest range waveform. Reception characteristics of each received OLSR packet on the base waveform is recorded. A heuristic based upon observed OLSR packet reception characteristics and previously characterized relative performance of the different waveforms is used to predict each node s one hop neighborhood conductivity for each non base waveform. It is also possible to perform reception characteristics to one hop neighborhood inference after receiving each node s TC message instead of before generating each node s TC message.
