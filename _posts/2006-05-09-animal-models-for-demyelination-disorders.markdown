This invention is in the field of neurology. Specifically the invention relates to the discovery and characterization of molecular components that play a role in neuronal demyelination or remyelination. In addition the invention relates to the generation of an animal model that exhibits hypomyelination. The compositions and methods embodied in the present invention are particularly useful for drug screening and or treatment of demyelination disorders.

Neuronal demyelination is a deleterious condition characterized by a reduction of myelin protein in the nervous system. Myelin is a vital component of the central CNS and peripheral PNS nervous system which encases the axons of neurons and forms an insulating layer known as the myelin sheath. The presence of the myelin sheath enhances the speed and integrity of nerve signal in form of electric potential propagating down the neural axon. The loss of myelin sheath produces significant impairment in sensory motor and other types of functioning as nerve signals reach their targets either too slowly asynchronously for example when some axons in a nerve conduct faster than others intermittently for example when conduction is impaired only at high frequencies or not at all.

The myelin sheath is formed by the plasma membrane or plasmalemma of glial cells oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the PNS. During the active phase of myelination each oligodendrocyte in the CNS must produce as much as approximately 5000 mof myelin surface area per day and approximately 10myelin protein molecules per minute Pfeiffer et al. 1993 3 191 197 . Myelinating oligodendrocytes have been identified at demyelinated lesions indicating that demyelinated axons may be repaired with the newly synthesized myelin.

Neuronal demyelination is manifested in a large number of hereditary and acquired disorders of the CNS and PNS. These disorders include Multiple Sclerosis MS Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy PML Encephalomyelitis Central Pontine Myelolysis CPM Anti MAG Disease Leukodystrophies Adrenoleukodystrophy ALD Alexander s Disease Canavan Disease Krabbe Disease Metachromatic Leukodystrophy MLD Pelizaeus Merzbacher Disease Refsum Disease Cockayne Syndrome Van der Knapp Syndrome and Zellweger Syndrome Guillain Barre Syndrome GBS chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy CIDP multifocual motor neuropathy MMN Alzheimer s disease and progressive supernuclear palsy. For many of these disorders there are no cures and few effective therapies.

Multiple sclerosis is the most common demyelinating disease of the central nervous system affecting approximately 1 000 000 people worldwide and some 250 000 to 350 000 people in the United States. The disease is characterized clinically by relapses and remissions and leading eventually to chronic disability. The earlier phase of multiple sclerosis is characterized by the autoimmune inflammatory strike against myelin sheath leading to paralysis lack of coordination sensory disturbances and visual impairment. The subsequent chronic progressive phase of the disease is typically due to active degeneration of the myelin sheath and inadequate remyelination of the demyelinated lesions Franklin 2002 3 705 714 Bruck et al. 2003 206 181 185 Compston et al. 2002 359 1221 1231 .

The precise etiology and pathogenesis of this disease remain unknown. However pathologic genetic and immunologic features have been identified which suggest that the disease involves inflammatory and autoimmune basis. See for example Waksman et al. 1984 175 282 294 Hafler et al. 1987 Immunol. Rev. 100 307 332. It is now known that pleotropic cytokine interferon IFN which is secreted by activated T Lymphocytes and natural killer cells plays a deleterious role in immune mediated demyelinating disorders including MS and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis EAE Popko et al. 1997 14 19 35 Popko and Baerwald 1999 24 331 338 Steinman 2001a 7 275 276 . This cytokine is normally absent in the CNS and becomes detectable during the symptomatic phase of these disorders Panitch 1992 44 946 962 . In vitro studies have shown that IFN is capable of promoting apoptosis in purified developing oligodendrocytes Baerwald and Popko 1998 52 230 239 Andrews et al. 1998 54 574 583 Feldhaus et al. 2004 111 89 96 . Despite these extensive studies the precise mechanism by which the secretion of IFN leads to oligodendroglial abnormalities and alteration to the myelin sheath is not well understood.

There thus remains a considerable need for compositions and methods applicable for elucidating the molecular bases of neuronal demyelination. There also exists a pressing need for developing biologically active agents effective in treating demyelination disorders.

The present invention provides a method of developing a biologically active agent that reduces neuronal demyelination. The method involves the steps of a contacting a candidate agent with a myelinating cell b detecting an altered expression of a gene or gene product or an altered activity of said gene product relative to a control cell said gene or gene product being correlated with endoplasmic reticulum ER stress and c selecting said agent as a candidate if the level of expression of said gene or gene product or the level of activity of said gene product is modulated relative to said control cell.

The present invention further provides a method of testing for a biologically active agent that modulates a phenomenon associated with a demyelination disorder.

The present invention provides another method for testing for a biologically active agent that modulates a phenomenon associated with a demyelination disorder. The method involves the steps of a administering a candidate biologically active agent to a test animal generated by a method comprising i inducing neuronal demyelination in said test animal and ii allowing said test animal to recover from the demyelination induction for a sufficient amount of time so that remyelination of a demyelinated lesion is exhibited and b determining the effect of said agent upon a phenomenon associated with a demyelination disorder.

In various embodiments of the present invention the phenomenon associated with a demyelination disorder is characterized by a loss of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system or Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. In other embodiments the phenomenon associated with a demyelination disorder is characterized by a decrease in myelinated axons in the central nervous system or peripheral nervous system.

In yet another aspect the animal exhibits an increased vulnerability to INF mediated neuronal demyelination relative to a wildtype animal.

Also included in the present invention is a method of inhibiting neuronal demyelination in a subject comprising administering to said subject an amount of biologically active agent effective to modulate stress level of endoplasmic reticulum ER in a myelinating cell in the perheral or in the central nverous system. The myelinating cell can be an oligodendrocyte or a Schwann cell. In one asepect of this embodiment the biologically active agent is effective to reduce a sustained stress level of endoplasmic reticulum ER in a myelinating cell. In some aspects the biologically active agent is an interferon gamma INF antagonist with the proviso that said interferon gamma INF antagonist is not an anti INF antibody when applied after the onset of neuronal demyelination. In other aspects the biologically active agent is an interferon gamma INF or interferon gamma INF agonist administered prior to the onset of neuronal demyelination to yield a prophylactic effect. Where desired the biologically active agent can be characterized by the ability to reduce a sustained stress level of ER which in turn can be characterized by a decrease in the levels of proteins correlated with endoplasmic reticulum ER stress. Exemplary ER stress correlated proteins include but are not limited to phosphorylated pancreatic ER kinase gene p PERK eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha eIF 2 eukaryotic translation initiation factor beta eIF 2 inositol requiring 1 IRE1 activating transcription factor 6 ARTF6 CAATT enhancer binding protein homologous protein CHOP binding immunoglobulin protein BIP caspase 12 growth and DNA damage protein 34 GADD34 CreP a constitutive repressor of eIF2alpha phosphorylation and X box binding protein 1 XBP 1 .

In yet another aspect the biologically active agent is effective to activate eIF 2 pathway by increasing PERK kinase activity or increasing the level of phosphorylated PERK or PERK dimer present in a cell. In still yet another aspect the biologically active agent is effective to activate eIF 2 pathway by deactivating GADD34 pathway. In some instances the deactivation of the GADD34 pathway results in reduced GADD34 signaling. In other instances the deactivation of GADD34 pathway results in a reduction of PPI protein phosphatase 1 phosphatase activity or a reduction in the level of PPI present in a cell.

The present invention further provides a method of ameliorating progression of a demyelination disorder in a subject in need for such treatment. The method comprises reducing in said subject the level of interferon gamma INF present in said subject s neuronal tissues that are undergoing remyelination or INF signaling. In some instances the reduction of the level of INF is effected by delivering to a demyelinated lesion an amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprised of interferon gamma INF antagonist e.g. an anti INF antibody or an antigen binding fragment . In another aspect a reduction in INF signaling is effected by a reduction in the level of a downstream signaling molecule of INF or biological activity thereof. The downstream signaling molecule of INF comprises SOCS1 and or Stat1.

A central aspect of the present invention is the discovery of the association of neuronal demyelination with endoplasmic reticulum ER stress level in cells that play a role in neuronal myelination.

Accordingly in one embodiment the present invention provides method of developing a biologically active agent that reduces neuronal demyelination. The method involves the steps of a contacting a candidate agent with a myelinating cell b detecting an altered expression of a gene or gene product or an altered activity of said gene product relative to a control cell said gene or gene product being correlated with endoplasmic reticulum ER stress and c selecting said agent as a candidate if the level of expression of said gene or gene product or the level of activity of said gene product is modulated relative to said control cell.

In another embodiment the present invention provides a method of developing a biologically active agent that promotes neuronal remyelination. The method comprises the steps of a contacting a candidate biologically active agent with a myelinating cell from a demyelinated lesion of a subject and b detecting an altered expression of a gene or gene product or an altered activity of said gene product relative to a control cell said gene or gene product being correlated with endoplasmic reticulum ER stress and c selecting said agent as a candidate if the level of expression of said gene or gene product or the level of activity of said gene product is modulated relative to said control cell.

The practice of the invention involves a comparison of the expression of a gene or gene product or the activity of said gene product in a test myelinating cell whether oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell relative to a control cell. The test myelinating cell used for this invention can be isolated from central or peripheral nervous systems and includes cell culture derived therefrom and the progeny thereof and section or smear prepared from the source or any other samples of the brain that contain oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells or their progenitors. Where desired one may choose to use enriched these cell cultures that are substantially free of other neuronal cell types such as neurons microglial cells and astrocytes. Various methods of isolating generating or maintaining matured oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells are known in the art Baerwald et al. 1998 52 230 239 Levi et al. 1996 68 1 21 6 and are exemplified herein.

In certain embodiments it may be preferable to employ myelinating cells from young subjects whose nervous systems are actively undergoing myelination. In other embodiments it may be preferable to use remyelinating cells derived from adult oligodendrocyte precursors in demyelinated lesions including but not limited to lesions inflicted by pathogens or physical injuries and lesions caused by toxic agents such as cuprizone. In yet other embodiments it may be preferable to use myelinating cells that are directly exposed to INF or that are derived from subjects whose nervous systems have been exposed to IFN . For instance one may choose to employ oligodendrocytes derived from transgenic animals that are ectopically expressed IFN in the central nervous systems. In still other embodiments one may select test myelinating cells that differentially express any ER stress related genes. Such myelinating cells may overexpress or underexpress ER stress causing genes or ER stress suppressing genes e.g. BIP and pancreatic ER kinase gene PERK . These myelinating cells may be derived from transgenic animals that have one or more ER stress related genes knocked in overexpress or knocked out underexpress .

Alternatively such myelinating cells can be generated by introducing into the cell a genetic vehicle to effect such overexpression or underexpression. A vast number of genetic vehicles suitable for the present invention are available in the art. They include both viral and non viral expression vectors. Non limiting exemplary viral expression vectors are vectors derived from RNA viruses such as retroviruses and DNA viruses such as adenoviruses and adeno associated viruses. Non viral expression vectors include but are not limited to plasmids cosmids and DNA liposome complexes. Where desired the genetic vehicles can be engineered to carry regulatory sequences that direct tissue specific cell specific or even organelle specific expression of the exogenous genes carried therein.

A number of tissue or cell specific regulatory sequences have been demonstrated applicable for expressing transgenes in the central nervous systems and peripheral nervous system. An exemplary sequence is the transcriptional regulatory sequence of the glial fibrillary acidic gene GFAP . The regulatory sequence allows ectopical expression of transgenes in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system e.g. in the Schwann cells .

A wide variety of subcellular localization sequences have been characterized and are applicable for directing organelle specific expression of transgenes. For instance subcellular localization sequence can be any one of the following a a signal sequence that directs secretion of the gene product outside of the cell b a membrane anchorage domain that allows attachment of the protein to the plasma membrane or other membraneous compartment of the cell c a nuclear localization sequence that mediates the translocation of the encoded protein to the nucleus d an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence e.g. KDEL sequence that confines the encoded protein primarily to the ER or e any other sequences that play a role in differential subcellular distribution of a encoded protein product.

The genetic vehicles can be inserted into a host cell e.g. myelinating cells such as oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells by any methods known in the art. Suitable methods may include transfection using calcium phosphate precipitation DEAE dextran electroporation or microinjection.

The selection of an appropriate control cell or tissue is dependent on the test cell or tissue initially selected and its phenotypic or genotypic characteristic which is under investigation. Whereas the test myelinating cell is derived from demyelinated lesions one or more counterparts from non demyelinated tissues can be used as control cells. Whereas the test myelinating cell is treated with IFN the control cell may be a non treated counterpart. It is generally preferable to analyze the test cell and the control in parallel.

For the purposes of this invention a biologically active agent effective to modulate neuronal demyelination is intended to include but not be limited to a biological or chemical compound such as a simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule peptide peptide mimetic protein e.g. antibody liposome small interfering RNA or a polynucleotide e.g. anti sense . A class of preferred agents include those that block the downstream signaling effect of a target molecule. This class of agents may include soluble ligand receptors or derivatives thereof that compete for the binding of the ligands with the native receptors typically anchored on the cell thereby preventing the ligands from mediating their downstream effect. The methodology is known in the art. See e.g. Economides et al. 2003 Nat Med 9 1 47 52.

A vast array of compounds can be synthesized for example polymers such as polypeptides and polynucleotides and synthetic organic compounds based on various core structures and these are also contemplated herein. In addition various natural sources can provide compounds for screening such as plant or animal extracts and the like. It should be understood although not always explicitly stated that the active agent can be used alone or in combination with another modulator having the same or different biological activity as the agents identified by the subject screening method. A preferred class of agent is INF antagonist. As is understood by one skilled in the art an antagonist inhibits the biological activity mediated by a target that it interacts. An antagonist can assert its inhibitory effect by directly binding to or directly interacting with the target. An antagonist can also assert its inhibitory effect indirectly by first interacting with a molecule in the same signaling pathway. The INF antagonist of the present invention encompasses simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule peptide peptide mimetic protein e.g. antibody liposome small interfering RNA or a polynucleotide e.g. anti sense that can reduce the deleterious effect of INF on neuronal demyelination.

In some instances where prophylactic effect is desired IFN or INF agonist e.g. salubrinol Sal can be applied prior to the onset of neuronal demyelination. As is understood by one skilled in the art an agonist activates the biological activity mediated by a target that it interacts. An agonist can assert its inhibitory effect by directly binding to or directly interacting with the target. An agonist can also assert its stimulatory effect indirectly by first interacting with a molecule in the same signaling pathway. The INF agonist of the present invention encompasses simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule peptide peptide mimetic protein e.g. antibody liposome small interfering RNA or a polynucleotide e.g. anti sense that can reduce the deleterious effect of INF on neuronal demyelination.

When the agent is a composition other than naked RNA the agent may be directly added to the cell culture or added to culture medium for addition. As is apparent to those skilled in the art an effective amount must be added which can be empirically determined. When the agent is a polynucleotide it may be introduced directly into a cell by transfection or electroporation. Alternatively it may be inserted into the cell using a gene delivery vehicle or other methods as described above.

As used herein ER stress related genes encompass all nucleic acids encoding proteins that correlate with stress in the ER. Generally these proteins play a role in ER homeostasis. There are many ways in which stress whether endogenous or exogenous that can be manifested in a cell these include but are not limited to pathogenic infection chemical insult genetic mutation nutrient deprivation and even normal cellular differentiation.

In general disruption of the homeostasis and hence ER stress is evidenced by the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen Rutkowski et al. 2004 14 20 28 Ma et al. 2001 107 827 830 . This stress elicits the unfolded protein response a functional mechanism by which cells attempt to protect themselves against ER stress. The unfolded protein response may involve 1 transcriptional induction of ER chaperone proteins whose function is both to increase folding capacity of the ER and prevent protein aggregation 2 translational attenuation to reduce protein overload and subsequent accumulation of unfolded proteins and 3 removal of misfolded proteins from the ER through retrograde transport coupled to their degradation by the 26S proteasome. These protective responses act transiently to maintain homeostasis within the ER but sustained ER stress can ultimately lead to the death of the cell Rutkowski et al. 2004 14 20 28 Ma et al. 2001 107 827 830 Rao et al. 2004 11 372 380 . As such genes involved in one or more aspects of the aforementioned unfolded protein response are suitable for practicing the present invention. Non limiting examples of ER stress related genes include pancreatic ER kinase gene PERK eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha eIF 2 eukaryotic translation initiation factor beta eIF 2 inositol requiring 1 IRE1 activating transcription factor 6 ARTF6 CAATT enhancer binding protein homologous protein CHOP binding immunoglobulin protein BIP caspase 12 growth and DNA damage protein 34 GADD34 CreP a constitutive repressor of eIF2alpha phosphorylation and X box binding protein 1 XBP 1 .

An altered expression of an ER stress related gene or gene product can be determined by assaying for a difference in the mRNA levels of the corresponding genes between the test myelinating cell and a control cell when they are contacted with a candidate agent. Alternatively the differential expression of the ER stress related gene is determined by detecting a difference in the level of the encoded polypeptide or gene product.

To assay for an agent induced alteration in the level of mRNA transcripts or corresponding polynucleotides nucleic acid contained in a biological sample comprising myelinating cells is first extracted according to standard methods in the art. For instance mRNA can be isolated using various lytic enzymes or chemical solutions according to the procedures set forth in Sambrook et al. 1989 supra or extracted by nucleic acid binding resins following the accompanying instructions provided by the manufacturers. The mRNA contained in the extracted nucleic acid sample is then detected by amplification procedures or conventional hybridization assays e.g. Northern blot analysis according to methods widely known in the art or based on the methods exemplified herein.

For purpose of this invention amplification means any method employing a primer and a polymerase capable of replicating a target sequence with reasonable fidelity. Amplification may be carried out by natural or recombinant DNA polymerases such as TaqGold T7 DNA polymerase Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase. A preferred amplification method is PCR. In particular the isolated RNA can be subjected to a reverse transcription assay that is coupled with a quantitative polymerase chain reaction RT PCR in order to quantify the expression level of an ER stress related gene.

Detection of the gene expression level can be conducted in real time in an amplification assay. In one aspect the amplified products can be directly visualized with fluorescent DNA binding agents including but not limited to DNA intercalators and DNA groove binders. Because the amount of the intercalators incorporated into the double stranded DNA molecules is typically proportional to the amount of the amplified DNA products one can conveniently determine the amount of the amplified products by quantifying the fluorescence of the intercalated dye using conventional optical systems in the art. DNA binding dye suitable for this application include SYBR green SYBR blue DAPI propidium iodine Hoeste SYBR gold ethidium bromide acridines proflavine acridine orange acriflavine fluorcoumanin ellipticine daunomycin chloroquine distamycin D chromomycin homidium mithramycin ruthenium polypyridyls anthramycin and the like.

In another aspect other fluorescent labels such as sequence specific probes can be employed in the amplification reaction to facilitate the detection and quantification of the amplified products. Probe based quantitative amplification relies on the sequence specific detection of a desired amplified product. It utilizes fluorescent target specific probes e.g. TaqMan probes resulting in increased specificity and sensitivity. Methods for performing probe based quantitative amplification are well established in the art and are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5 210 015.

In yet another aspect conventional hybridization assays using hybridization probes that share sequence homology with ER stress related genes can be performed. Typically probes are allowed to form stable complexes with the target polynucleotides e.g. ER stress related genes contained within the biological sample derived from the test subject in a hybridization reaction. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that where antisense is used as the probe nucleic acid the target polynucleotides provided in the sample are chosen to be complementary to sequences of the antisense nucleic acids. Conversely where the nucleotide probe is a sense nucleic acid the target polynucleotide is selected to be complementary to sequences of the sense nucleic acid.

As is known to one skilled in the art hybridization can be performed under conditions of various stringency. Suitable hybridization conditions for the practice of the present invention are such that the recognition interaction between the probe and target ER stress related gene is both sufficiently specific and sufficiently stable. Conditions that increase the stringency of a hybridization reaction are widely known and published in the art. See for example Sambrook et al. 1989 supra Nonradioactive In Situ Hybridization Application Manual Boehringer Mannheim second edition . The hybridization assay can be formed using probes immobilized on any solid support including but are not limited to nitrocellulose glass silicon and a variety of gene arrays. A preferred hybridization assay is conducted on high density gene chips as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 445 934.

For a convenient detection of the probe target complexes formed during the hybridization assay the nucleotide probes are conjugated to a detectable label. Detectable labels suitable for use in the present invention include any composition detectable by photochemical biochemical spectroscopic immunochemical electrical optical or chemical means. A wide variety of appropriate detectable labels are known in the art which include fluorescent or chemiluminescent labels radioactive isotope labels enzymatic or other ligands. In preferred embodiments one will likely desire to employ a fluorescent label or an enzyme tag such as digoxigenin galactosidase urease alkaline phosphatase or peroxidase avidin biotin complex.

The detection methods used to detect or quantify the hybridization intensity will typically depend upon the label selected above. For example radiolabels may be detected using photographic film or a phosphoimager. Fluorescent markers may be detected and quantified using a photodetector to detect emitted light. Enzymatic labels are typically detected by providing the enzyme with a substrate and measuring the reaction product produced by the action of the enzyme on the substrate and finally colorimetric labels are detected by simply visualizing the colored label.

An agent induced change in expression of ER stress related genes can also be determined by examining the corresponding gene products. Determining the protein level typically involves a contacting the protein contained in a biological sample comprising myelinating cells with an agent that specifically bind to the ER stress related protein and b identifying any agent protein complex so formed. In one aspect of this embodiment the agent that specifically binds an ER stress related protein is an antibody preferably a monoclonal antibody.

The reaction is performed by contacting the agent with a sample of the ER stress related proteins derived from the test samples under conditions that will allow a complex to form between the agent and the ER stress related proteins. The formation of the complex can be detected directly or indirectly according to standard procedures in the art. In the direct detection method the agents are supplied with a detectable label and unreacted agents may be removed from the complex the amount of remaining label thereby indicating the amount of complex formed. For such method it is preferable to select labels that remain attached to the agents even during stringent washing conditions. It is preferable that the label does not interfere with the binding reaction. In the alternative an indirect detection procedure requires the agent to contain a label introduced either chemically or enzymatically. A desirable label generally does not interfere with binding or the stability of the resulting agent polypeptide complex. However the label is typically designed to be accessible to an antibody for an effective binding and hence generating a detectable signal.

A wide variety of labels suitable for detecting protein levels are known in the art. Non limiting examples include radioisotopes enzymes colloidal metals fluorescent compounds bioluminescent compounds and chemiluminescent compounds.

The amount of agent polypeptide complexes formed during the binding reaction can be quantified by standard quantitative assays. As illustrated above the formation of agent polypeptide complex can be measured directly by the amount of label remained at the site of binding. In an alternative the ER stress related protein is tested for its ability to compete with a labeled analog for binding sites on the specific agent. In this competitive assay the amount of label captured is inversely proportional to the amount of ER stress related protein present in a test sample.

A number of techniques for protein analysis based on the general principles outlined above are available in the art. They include but are not limited to radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunoradiometric assays sandwich immunoassays immunoradiometric assays in situ immunoassays using e.g. colloidal gold enzyme or radioisotope labels western blot analysis immunoprecipitation assays immunofluorescent assays and SDS PAGE.

Antibodies that specifically recognize or bind to ER stress related proteins are preferable for conducting the aforementioned protein analyses. Where desired antibodies that recognize a specific type of post translational modifications e.g. ER stress inducible modifications can be used. Post translational modifications include but are not limited to glycosylation lipidation acetylation and phosphorylation. These antibodies may be purchased from commercial vendors. For example anti phosphotyrosine antibodies that specifically recognize tyrosine phosphorylated proteins are available from a number of vendors including Invitrogen and Perkin Elmer. Anti phosphotyrosine antibodies are particularly useful in detecting proteins that are differentially phosphorylated on their tyrosine residues in response to an ER stress. Such proteins include but are not limited to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha eIF 2 . Alternatively these antibodies can be generated using conventional polyclonal or monoclonal antibody technologies by immunizing a host animal or an antibody producing cell with a target protein that exhibits the desired post translational modification.

In practicing the subject method it may be desirable to discern the expression pattern of an ER stress related protein in different bodily tissue in different cell types and or in different subcellular structures. These studies can be performed with the use of tissue specific cell specific or subcellular structure specific antibodies capable of binding to protein markers that are preferentially expressed in certain tissues cell types or subcellular structures.

For example to localize a target ER stress related protein to a specific cell type such as oligodendrocyte co staining with one or more antibodies specific for oligodendrocyte markers can be used. Exemplary markers for oligodendrocyte include but are not limited to CC1 myelin basic protein MBP ceramide galactosyltransferase CGT myelin associated glycoprotein MAG myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein OMG cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase CNP NOGO myelin protein zero MPZ peripheral myelin protein 22 PMP22 protein 2 P2 galactocerebroside GalC sulfatide and proteolipid protein PLP . To detect or quantify an ER stress related protein localized in a specific subcellular structure co staining with one or more antibodies directed to antigens differentially present in such structure is preferably performed. A wide variety of organelle specific antibodies is available in the art. Non limiting examples include endoplasmic reticulum ER specific antibodies directed to the ER resident protein BIP plasma membrane specific antibodies reactive with cell surface receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor EGF receptor Golgi specific antibody adaptin and cytokeratin specific antibodies which differentiate cytokeratins from different cell types e.g. between epithelial and stromal cells . To detect and quantify the immunospecific binding digital image systems including but not limited to confocal microscope can be employed.

An altered expression of an ER stress related gene can also be determined by examining a change in activity of the gene product relative to a control cell. The assay for an agent induced change in the activity of an ER stress related protein will dependent on the biological activity and or the signal transduction pathway that is under investigation. For example where the ER stress related protein is a kinase a change in its ability to phosphorylate the downstream substrate s can be determined by a variety of assays known in the art. Representative assays include but are not limited to immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation with antibodies such as anti phosphotyrosine antibodies that recognize phosphorylated proteins. In addition kinase activity can be detected by high throughput chemiluminescent assays such as AlphaScreen available from Perkin Elmer and eTag assay Chan Hui et al. 2003 111 162 174 .

Where the ER stress related protein is part of a signaling cascade leading to a fluctuation of intracellular pH condition pH sensitive molecules such as fluorescent pH dyes can be used as the reporter molecules. In another example where the ER stress related protein is an ion channel fluctuations in membrane potential and or intracellular ion concentration can be monitored. A number of commercial kits and high throughput devices are particularly suited for a rapid and robust screening for modulators of ion channels. Representative instruments include FLIPR Molecular Devices Inc. and VIPR Aurora Biosciences . These instruments are capable of detecting reactions in over 1000 sample wells of a microplate simultaneously and providing real time measurement and functional data within a second or even a minisecond.

In yet another example where the ER stress related protein is a protease its activity in cleaving substrate proteins can be detected by analyzing the cleaved polypeptides. Several methods for analyzing polypeptides are available in the art. Non limiting exemplary methods are 2 D electrophoresis mass spectrum analysis and peptide sequencing.

The candidate agents identified by the subject method can be further characterized in whole or in part by their abilities to modulate neuronal demyelination that occurs in a wide variety of conditions. For instance neuronal demyelination may occur in disorders inflicted by pathogens or physical injuries disorders attributable to genetic predispositions inflammation and or autoimmune responses. Specifically neuronal demyelination may occur upon bacterial or viral infection as in e.g. HIV vacuolar myelinopathy and HTLV. It may also result from direct contact with toxic substances or accumulation of toxic metabolites in the body as in e.g. central pontine myelinolysis and vitamin deficiencies. Neuronal demyelination may also manifest in spinal cord injury genetic disorders including but not limited to leukodystrophies adrenoleukodystrophy degenerative multi system atrophy Binswanger encephalopathy tumors in the central nervous system and multiple sclerosis.

Morphologically neuronal demyelination can be characterized by a loss of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system or Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. It can also be determined by a decrease in myelinated axons in the nervous system or by a reduction in the levels of oligodendrocyte or Schwann cell markers. Exemplary marker proteins of oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells include but are not limited to CC1 myelin basic protein MBP ceramide galactosyltransferase CGT myelin associated glycoprotein MAG myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein OMG cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase CNP NOGO myelin protein zero MPZ peripheral myelin protein 22 PMP22 protein 2 P2 galactocerebroside GalC sulfatide and proteolipid protein PLP . As such the candidate agents identified by the subject method encompass substances that can inhibit the deleterious morphological characteristics of neuronal demyelination.

Candidate agents identified by the subject method can be broadly categorized into the following two classes. The first class encompasses agents that when administered into a cell or a subject reduce the level of expression or activity of an ER stress causing gene or protein. The second class includes agents that augment the level of expression or activity of an ER stress suppressing gene or protein e.g. BIP and PERK . In one aspect the agent reduces the levels of proteins e.g. major histocompatibility complex I that are characteristic of an endoplasmic reticulum stress in remyelinating oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system or Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system.

The development of a biologically active agent beneficial for a neuronal demyelination condition may also involve the use of animal models. Accordingly the present invention provides a method of using animal models for testing a biologically active agent that modulates a phenomenon associated with a demyelination disorder. The method comprises the steps of a administering a candidate biologically active agent to a test animal generated by a method comprising i inducing neuronal demyelination in said test animal and ii allowing said test animal to recover from the demyelination induction for a sufficient amount of time so that remyelination of a demyelinated lesion is exhibited and b determining the effect of said agent upon a phenomenon associated with a demyelination disorder.

The animal models of the present invention encompass any non human vertebrates that are amenable to procedures yielding a neuronal demyelination condition in the animal s nervous systems including the central and peripheral nervous system. Preferred model organisms include but are not limited to mammals primates and rodents. Non limiting examples of the preferred models are rats mice guinea pigs cats dogs rabbits pigs chimpanzees and monkeys. The test animals can be wildtype or transgenic.

In one aspect the subject method employs a transgenic animal having stably integrated into the genome a transgenic nucleotide sequence encoding interferon gamma INF . In another aspect the subject method involves a transgenic animal having an altered expression of at least one other gene wherein upon expression of INF the animal exhibits a greater degree of demyelination relative to a transgenic animal having a stably integrated transgenic nucleotide sequence encoding interferon gamma INF alone. In a preferred aspect the at least one other gene encodes an ER stress related protein. In another preferred aspect the test animal is a heterozygous knock out of pancreatic ER kinase gene PERK having a stably integrated into the genome a transgenic nucleotide sequence encoding interferon gamma INF . Preferably expression of the transgene s carried in the transgenic animal are inducible to effect expression that is ectopical tissue specific cell type specific or even organelle specific.

As described above tissue specific and cell specific regulatory sequences are available for expressing transgenes in the central nervous systems. An exemplary sequence is the transcriptional regulatory sequence of the glial fibrillary acidic gene GFAP . The regulatory sequence allows ectopical expression of transgenes in the central nervous system and specifically in the astrocytes. Where expression of the transgene in particular subcellular location is desired the transgene can be operably linked to the corresponding subcellular localization sequences by recombinant DNA techniques widely practiced in the art. Exemplary subcellular localization sequences include but are not limited to a a signal sequence that directs secretion of the gene product outside of the cell b a membrane anchorage domain that allows attachment of the protein to the plasma membrane or other membraneous compartment of the cell c a nuclear localization sequence that mediates the translocation of the encoded protein to the nucleus d an endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence e.g. KDEL sequence that confines the encoded protein primarily to the ER or e any other sequences that play a role in differential subcellular distribution of a encoded protein product.

A demyelination condition in the test animal generally refers to a decrease in myelinated axons in the nervous systems e.g. the central or peripheral nervous system or by a reduction in the levels of markers of myelinating cells such as oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Exemplary markers for identifying myelinating cells include but are not limited to CC1 myelin basic protein MBP ceramide galactosyltransferase CGT myelin associated glycoprotein MAG myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein OMG cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase CNP NOGO myelin protein zero MPZ peripheral myelin protein 22 PMP22 protein 2 P2 galactocerebroside GalC sulfatide and proteolipid protein PLP .

These phenomena can be observed by immunohistochemical means or protein analysis described herein. In one aspect sections of the test animal s brain can be stained with antibodies that specifically recognize an oligodendrocyte marker. In another aspect the expression levels of oligodendrocyte markers can be quantified by immunoblotting hybridization means and amplification procedures and any other methods that are well established in the art and or provided herein.

A number of methods for inducing demyelination in a test animal have been established. For instance neuronal demyelination may be inflicted by pathogens or physical injuries agents that induce inflammation and or autoimmune responses in the test animal. A preferred method employs demyelination induced agents including but not limited to INF and cuprizone bis cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone . The cuprizone induced demyelination model is described in Matsushima et al. 2001 11 107 116. In this method the test animals are typically fed with a diet containing cuprizone for a few weeks ranging from about 1 to about 10 weeks.

After induction of a demyelination condition by an appropriate method the animal is allowed to recover for a sufficient amount of time to allow remyelination at or near the previously demyelinated lesions. While the amount of time required for developing remyelinated axons varies among different animals it generally requires at least about 1 week more often requires at least about 2 to 10 weeks and even more often requires about 4 to about 10 weeks. Remeylination can be ascertained by observing an increase in myelinated axons in the nervous systems e.g. in the central or peripheral nervous system or by detecting an increase in the levels of marker proteins of a myelinating cell. The same methods of detecting demyelination can be employed to determine whether remyelination has occurred.

Determining the effect of the test agent upon a phenomenon associated with a demyelination may involve any suitable methods known in the art including but not limited to those mentioned in the above cell based assay section. In general immunohistochemical and electron microscopic analysis can be performed to visualize the effect of the test agent. In addition procedures applicable for detecting differential expression of ER stress related genes or gene products can be employed. Techniques for measuring activities of ER stress related proteins are also applicable. As described above non limiting examples of ER stress related genes include pancreatic ER kinase gene PERK eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha eIF 2 eukaryotic translation initiation factor beta eIF 2 inositol requiring 1 IRE1 activating transcription factor 6 ARTF6 CAATT enhancer binding protein homologous protein CHOP binding immunoglobulin protein BIP caspase 12 growth and DNA damage protein 34 GADD34 CreP a constitutive repressor of eIF2alpha phosphorylation and X box binding protein 1 XBP 1 .

In a separate embodiment the present invention provides a non human transgenic animal suitable for elucidating the pathogenesis of neuronal demyelination conditions. The transgenic animal is also useful for developing biologically active agent effective to inhibit neuronal demyelination or promote remyelination of demyelinated lesions. In one aspect the subject transgenic animal has a stably integrated into the genome of the animal a transgenic nucleotide sequence encoding interferon gamma INF and b an altered expression of at least one other gene wherein upon expression of said INF the animal exhibits a greater degree of demyelination relative to a transgenic animal having a stably integrated transgenic nucleotide sequence encoding interferon gamma INF as in a but lacking said altered expression of said at least one other gene.

The present invention contemplates transgenic animals that carry one or more desired transgenes in all their cells as well as animals which carry the transgenes in some but not all their cells i.e. mosaic animals. Animals of any species including but not limited to mice rats rabbits guinea pigs pigs micro pigs goats and non human primates e.g. baboons monkeys and chimpanzees may be used to generate the subject transgenic animals.

A desired transgene may be integrated as a single copy or in concatamers e.g. head to head tandems or head to tail tandems. The desired transgene may also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular tissue or cell type preferably cells within the central nervous system. The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. Preferably the targeted cell types are located in the nervous systems including the central and peripheral nervous systems.

When it is desired that the transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous counterpart gene targeting is preferred. Briefly when such a technique is to be utilized vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous counterpart are designed for the purpose of integrating via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene.

Advances in technologies for embryo micromanipulation now permit introduction of heterologous DNA into fertilized mammalian ova as well. For instance totipotent or pluripotent stem cells can be transformed by microinjection calcium phosphate mediated precipitation liposome fusion retroviral infection or other means. The transformed cells are then introduced into the embryo and the embryo will then develop into a transgenic animal. In a preferred embodiment developing embryos are infected with a viral vector containing a desired transgene so that the transgenic animals expressing the transgene can be produced from the infected embryo. In another preferred embodiment a desired transgene is coinjected into the pronucleus or cytoplasm of the embryo preferably at the single cell stage and the embryo is allowed to develop into a mature transgenic animal. These and other variant methods for generating transgenic animals are well established in the art and hence are not detailed herein. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 175 385 and 5 175 384.

The transgenic animals of the present invention can be broadly categorized into two types knockouts and knockins . A knockout has an alteration in the target gene via the introduction of transgenic sequences that results in a decrease of function of the target gene preferably such that target gene expression is insignificant or undetectable. A knockin is a transgenic animal having an alteration in a host cell genome that results in an augmented expression of a target gene e.g. by introduction of an additional copy of the target gene or by operatively inserting a regulatory sequence that provides for enhanced expression of an endogenous copy of the target gene. The knock in or knock out transgenic animals can be heterozygous or homozygous with respect to the target genes. Both knockouts and knockins can be bigenic . Bigenic animals have at least two host cell genes being altered. A preferred bigenic animal carries a transgene encoding IFN and another transgenic sequence that disrupts the function of at least one other gene.

In certain aspect of this embodiment the at least one other gene is an ER stress related gene. In another aspect the other gene can be an exogenous gene i.e. a gene that is not present in the host cell or an endogenous gene i.e. the introduced gene finds an endogenous counterpart native to the recipient animal. Such ER stress related gene may be selected from the group consisting of pancreatic ER kinase gene PERK eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha eIF 2 eukaryotic translation initiation factor beta eIF 2 inositol requiring 1 IRE1 activating transcription factor 6 ARTF6 CAATT enhancer binding protein homologous protein CHOP binding immunoglobulin protein BIP caspase 12 growth and DNA damage protein 34 GADD34 CreP a constitutive repressor of eIF2alpha phosphorylation and X box binding protein 1 XBP 1 .

A preferred non human transgenic animal comprises a heterozygous knockout of pancreatic ER kinase gene PERK and has stably integrated into the genome a transgenic nucleotide sequence comprising interferon gamma INF . In one aspect a preferred transgenic animal exhibits an increased vulnerability to INF mediated neuronal demyelination relative to a wildtype animal.

Also provided in the present invention are cells of the subject non human transgenic animal. In one aspect the cells comprise stably integrated in the genome a transgene encoding INF and an alteration in at least one other gene encoding a protein correlated with ER stress. In another aspect the subject cells are from the central nervous system. In yet another aspect the subject cells are oligodendrocytes. In yet another aspect the subject cells are from the peripheral nervous system including but not limited to Schwann cells.

As discussed in the sections above these cells are particularly useful for conducting cell based assays for elucidating the molecular bases of neuronal demyelination conditions and for developing agents effective for inhibiting neuronal demyelination or promoting remyelination.

The selected biologically active agents effective to modulate ER stress related genes or proteins may be used for the preparation of medicaments for treating neuronal demyelination disorders. A preferred class of agents is effective to alleviate INF elicited ER stress in oligodendrocytes.

In one aspect the selected agent of this invention can be administered to treat neuronal demyelination inflicted by pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. In another aspect the selected agent can be used to treat neuronal demyelination caused by toxic substances or accumulation of toxic metabolites in the body as in e.g. central pontine myelinolysis and vitamin deficiencies. In yet another aspect the agent can be used to treat demyelination caused by physical injury such as spinal cord injury. In still yet another aspect the agent can be administered to treat demyelination manifested in disorders having genetic attributes genetic disorders including but not limited to leukodystrophies adrenoleukodystrophy degenerative multi system atrophy Binswanger encephalopathy tumors in the central nervous system and multiple sclerosis.

Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer a biologically active agent of the invention e.g. encapsulation in liposomes microparticles microcapsules expression by recombinant cells receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu and Wu 1987 262 4429 4432 construction of a therapeutic nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector etc. Methods of delivery include but are not limited to intra arterial intra muscular intravenous intranasal and oral routes. In a specific embodiment it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment this may be achieved by for example and not by way of limitation local infusion during surgery by injection or by means of a catheter. In certain embodiment the agents are delivered to a subject s nerve systems preferably the central nervous system. In another embodiment the agents are administered to neuronal tissues undergoing remyelination.

Administration of the selected agent can be effected in one dose continuously or intermittently throughout the course of treatment. Methods of determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to those of skill in the art and will vary with the composition used for therapy the purpose of the therapy the target cell being treated and the subject being treated. Single or multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected by the treating physician.

The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is conducted in accordance with generally accepted procedures for the preparation of pharmaceutical preparations. See for example 18 1990 E. W. Martin ed. Mack Publishing Co. PA. Depending on the intended use and mode of administration it may be desirable to process the active ingredient further in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. Appropriate processing may include mixing with appropriate non toxic and non interfering components sterilizing dividing into dose units and enclosing in a delivery device.

Pharmaceutical compositions for oral intranasal or topical administration can be supplied in solid semi solid or liquid forms including tablets capsules powders liquids and suspensions. Compositions for injection can be supplied as liquid solutions or suspensions as emulsions or as solid forms suitable for dissolution or suspension in liquid prior to injection. For administration via the respiratory tract a preferred composition is one that provides a solid powder or aerosol when used with an appropriate aerosolizer device.

Liquid pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can for example be prepared by dissolving or dispersing a polypeptide embodied herein in a liquid excipient such as water saline aqueous dextrose glycerol or ethanol. The composition can also contain other medicinal agents pharmaceutical agents adjuvants carriers and auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents and pH buffering agents.

Where desired the pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated in slow release or sustained release forms whereby a relatively consistent level of the active compound are provided over an extended period.

Another embodiment of the present invention is a method of promoting remyelination using stem cells in a subject. In this approach cultured stem cells are typically transfected with a gene capable of ameliorating ER stress in myelinating oligodendrocytes. The genetically modified stem cells are then introduced into the CNS of a subject suffering from a neuronal demyelination condition. Any means effective to deliver the genetically modified stem cells are applicable. Typically the stem cells are directly injected into the nervous system of a subject. This methodology is described in detail in e.g. Morris et al. 1997 272 7 4327 34 which is incorporated herein by reference. Candidate genes to be introduced into stem cells include but are not limited to BIP PERK and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 SOCS1 .

It is documented that BIP is required to protect cells from ER stress overexpression of BIP permits continued translation of cellular mRNAs and hence reduces ER stress. SOCS1 is known to block INF signal transduction. As such stem cells overexpressing SOCS1 and hence myelinating cells derived from such stem cells are expected to be less sensitive to the demyelinating effect mediate by INF .

Populations of neuronal cells can be produced from differentiating cultures of embryonic stem cells Li et al. 1998 8 971 974 and have been used in experimental models to correct various deficits in animal model systems review Svendsen and Smith 22 357 364 .

In humans neuronal cells can be derived from human embryonal carcinoma cells and can be induced to differentiate using retinoic acid. These embryonic stem cells have been shown to correct deficits in experimental models of CNS disease. In some embodiments modulators of ER stress can be expressed in pluripotent stem cells. Preferably the engineered stem cells can be introduced into patients in need thereof to induce regeneration and or protect neuronal cells from demyelination associated with anyone of the disorders cited herein. Pluripotent stem cells may be embryonic stem cells ES or embryonic germ cells EG . Generation of neural progenitors from stem cells in vitro may serve as an unlimited source of cells for tissue reconstruction and for the delivery and expression of genes in the nervous system.

Methods for culturing ES and EG cells are known in the art. For instance ES and EG lines may be cultured on feeder layers and may be grown and maintained in an undifferentiated state in the presence of recombinant hormones such as Fibroblast Growth Factor and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor. Differentiation can be initiated either by changing the hormonal milieu forming embryoid bodies or a combination of both. Embryoid body formation is the most widely used process. Alternatively tissue specific reversible transformation can be used for establishing differentiated neuronal cell lines using stem cells as a starting material according to the method described in US Patent Application 20060068496 which is incorporated herein by reference. US Patent Application 20060068496 discloses methods that employ tissue specific expression of a transforming gene which can be used to identify and culture the particular cell type. This transforming event can in some forms of the method then be reversed using one of a number of possible processes leaving a clonal or semi purified population of non transformed differentiated cells including populations of different or semi purified cells or a clonal population of cells as discussed herein. The glial fibrillary acetic protein GFAP promoter has been used to selectively express genes in cells of glial origin. Neuronal progenitor cells can be differentiated to give rise to neurons and glial cells. Markers that can be used to identify a neuronal cell include but are not limited to GFAP and MPB.

The preferred cell for use in cell therapy is human embryonic stem cell. In one aspect the present invention provides an enriched preparation of undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells capable of expressing a modulator of one or more ER stress proteins and that can proliferate in vitro and differentiate into neural progenitor cells neuron cells and or glial cells. In another embodiment of the present invention neural progenitor cells are first derived from human ES cells which are engineered to express one or more modulators of the ER stress pathway and subsequently are differentiated into mature neuronal cells and glial cells including oligodendrocyte and astrocyte cells. Alternatively the neuronal progenitor cells are first differentiated into mature neuronal cells that include oligodendrocytes and astrocytes which are subsequently engineered to express one or more modulators of the ER stress response.

The modulators that can be induced to be expressed in the neural progenitor cells include modulators of protein folding and maturation protein transport protein synthesis and modification Ca homeostasis transcription factors UPR target genes and proteins that mediate apoptosis. Modulators of protein folding and maturation include but are not limited to modulators of BIP GRP78 protein disulfide isomerase related protein P5 collagen binding protein 2 fourth mammalian ER DNAJ protein ERdj4 oxygen regulated protein 150 kD ORP150 FK506 binding protein FKBP13 GRP94 protein disulfide isomerase ERp70 like protein disulfide isomerase ERp60 like proline 4 hydroxylase subunit P4HB hsc70 71 kD heat shock cognate protein . Modulators of protein transport include but are not limited to modulators of putative mitochondrial membrane protein import receptor hTIM44 translocon associated protein delta subunit TRAP and transmembrane protein rnp24. Modulators of protein synthesis and modification include but are not limited to modulators of glycyl tRNA synthase alanyl tRNA synathase asparagine synthase glutamine fructose 6 phosphate amidotransferase GFAT and integral membrane protein 1 ITM1 . Modulators of Ca homeostasis include but are not limited to modulators of calreticulin stanniocalcin 2 plasma membrane Ca pumping ATPase calnexin novel DNA binding EF hand leucine zipper protein NEFA and nucleonidin 1. Modulators of transcription factors include but are not limited to modulators of CHOP C EBP beta TGF stimulated clone 22 TSC22 like X box binding protein 1 XBP 1 and Egr 1. Modulators of UPR target genes nclude but are not limited to modulators of HERP and SERP RAMP4. Modulators of apoptosis include but are not limited to modulators of Bbc3 PUMA caspase 3 and caspase 12.

Preferably the modulators that are expressed in the undifferentiated or differentiated neuronal cells are modulators of the PERK pathway. In an embodiment one or more modulators of the PERK pathway can be expressed in the undifferentiated or differentiated neural cells. For example the neural progenitor cells can be induced to express a synthetic PERK fusion enzyme that enhances the level of the phosphorylated eIF 2 p eIF 2 while simultaneously expressing an inhibitor of the INF cytokine signaling pathway e.g. SOCS1.

In yet another aspect the present invention provides neural progenitor cells neuronal cells and glial cells that express modulators of the PERK pathway and can used for cell therapy and gene therapy. The route of delivery that is selected for the stem cells is crucial in that it helps to determine whether or not repair of the damaged organ will occur. A high stem cell concentration near the damaged area increases the chances that sufficient stem cell localization and differentiation occurs in order to repair the organ. In many cases this involves the targeted and regional administration of stem cells.

Gene therapy is an alternative approach for promoting remyelination by modulating ER stress of myelinating cells. When expression vectors are used for gene therapy in vivo or ex vivo a pharmaceutically acceptable vector is preferred such as a replication incompetent retroviral or adenoviral vector. Pharmaceutically acceptable vectors containing an ER stress suppressing genes of this invention can be further modified for transient or stable expression of the inserted polynucleotide. As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable vector includes but is not limited to a vector or delivery vehicle having the ability to selectively target and introduce an ER stress suppressing gene into cells located in the nerve systems and preferably oligodendrocytes in the nerve systems. An example of a replication incompetent retroviral vector is LNL6 Miller A. D. et al. 1989 7 980 990 . The methodology of using replication incompetent retroviruses for retroviral mediated gene transfer of gene markers is well established Correll et al. 1989 86 8912 Bordignon 1989 86 8912 52 Culver K. 1991 88 3155 and Rill D. R. 1991 79 10 2694 700. Clinical investigations have shown that there are few or no adverse effects associated with the viral vectors see Anderson 1992 256 808 13. Alternatively introduction of ER stress suppressing genes can be performed using the methodology described in Chemajovsky et al. 2004 Nat. Rev. Immunol. 4 10 800 11.

The expression of ER stress causing genes can be inhibited or prevented in myelinating cells including oligodendrocytes and Scwhann cells by using RNA interference RNAi technology a type of post transcriptional gene silencing. RNAi may be used to create a pseudo knockout i.e. a system in which the expression of the product encoded by a gene or coding region of interest is reduced resulting in an overall reduction of the activity of the encoded product in a system. As such RNAi may be performed to target a nucleic acid of interest or fragment or variant thereof to in turn reduce its expression and the level of activity of the product which it encodes. Such a system may be used for functional studies of the product as well as to treat disorders related to the activity of such a product. RNAi is described in for example Hammond et al. 2001 10 293 5532 1146 50 Caplen et al. 2001 2001 Aug. 14 98 17 9742 7 all of which are herein incorporated by reference. Reagents and kits for performing RNAi are available commercially from for example Ambion Inc. Austin Tex. USA and New England Biolabs Inc. Beverly Mass. USA .

The initial agent for RNAi in some systems is thought to be dsRNA molecule corresponding to a target nucleic acid. The dsRNA is then thought to be cleaved into short interfering RNAs siRNAs which are 21 23 nucleotides in length 19 21 bp duplexes each with 2 nucleotide 3 overhangs . The enzyme thought to effect this first cleavage step has been referred to as Dicer and is categorized as a member of the RNase III family of dsRNA specific ribonucleases. Alternatively RNAi may be effected via directly introducing into the cell or generating within the cell by introducing into the cell a suitable precursor e.g. vector encoding precursor s etc. of such an siRNA or siRNA like molecule. An siRNA may then associate with other intracellular components to form an RNA induced silencing complex RISC . The RISC thus formed may subsequently target a transcript of interest via base pairing interactions between its siRNA component and the target transcript by virtue of homology resulting in the cleavage of the target transcript approximately 12 nucleotides from the 3 end of the siRNA. Thus the target mRNA is cleaved and the level of protein product it encodes is reduced.

RNAi may be effected by the introduction of suitable in vitro synthesized siRNA or siRNA like molecules into cells. RNAi may for example be performed using chemically synthesized RNA. Alternatively suitable expression vectors may be used to transcribe such RNA either in vitro or in vivo. In vitro transcription of sense and antisense strands encoded by sequences present on the same vector or on separate vectors may be effected using for example T7 RNA polymerase in which case the vector may comprise a suitable coding sequence operably linked to a T7 promoter. The in vitro transcribed RNA may in embodiments be processed e.g. using RNase III in vitro to a size conducive to RNAi. The sense and antisense transcripts are combined to form an RNA duplex which is introduced into a target cell of interest. Other vectors may be used which express small hairpin RNAs shRNAs which can be processed into siRNA like molecules. Various vector based methods are described in for example Brummelkamp et al. 2002 April 19 296 5567 550 3. Epub 2002 Mar. 21 Brummelkamp et al. 2002 September 2 3 243 7. Paddison et al. 2002 2002 Apr. 15 16 8 948 58. Various methods for introducing such vectors into cells either in vitro or in vivo e.g. gene therapy are known in the art.

Accordingly in an embodiment the expression of one or more ER stress causing genes may be inhibited by introducing into or generating within a cell an siRNA or siRNA like molecule corresponding to a nucleic acid encoding the ER stress causing gene or fragment thereof or to an nucleic acid homologous thereto. siRNA like molecule refers to a nucleic acid molecule similar to a siRNA e.g. in size and structure and capable of eliciting siRNA activity i.e. to effect the RNAi mediated inhibition of expression. In various embodiments such a method may entail the direct administration of the siRNA or siRNA like molecule into a cell or use of the vector based methods described above. In an embodiment the siRNA or siRNA like molecule is less than about 30 nucleotides in length. In a further embodiment the siRNA or siRNA like molecule is about 21 23 nucleotides in length. In an embodiment siRNA or siRNA like molecule comprises a 19 21 bp duplex portion each strand having a 2 nucleotide 3 overhang. In embodiments the siRNA or siRNA like molecule is substantially homologous to a nucleic acid encoding the ER stress causing gene or a fragment or variant or a fragment of a variant thereof. Such a variant is capable of encoding a protein having ER stress causing activity.

Such RNAi methods can be used to inhibit expression of INF in for example the central nervous system. ER stress causing genes that may be inhibited by RNAi methods include but are not limited to INF GADD34 protein phosphatase 1 PP1 and one or more genes that mediate apoptosis e.g. genes that encode caspases.

The invention may be better understood by reference to the following examples which are intended to merely illustrate but not limit the mode now known for practicing the invention.

The effects of INF on demyelination were evaluated in a cuprizone animal model using transgenic mice that allow for temporally regulated delivery of IFN using the tetracycline controllable system Lin et al. 2004 24 10074 10083 . The transgenic mice were generated by mating line 110 GFAP tTA mice on the C57BL 6 background with line 184 TRE IFN on the C57BL 6 background to produce GFAP tTA TRE INF double transgenic mice Lin et al. 2004 24 10074 10083 . Transcriptional activation of the TRE INF transgene by tTA was repressed in the control DOX mice by adding 0.05 mg ml doxycycline to the drinking water which was provided ad libitum from the day of conception. The DOX double transgenic mice were GFAP tTA TRE IFN double transgenic animals fed cuprizone chow and never released from the doxycycline solution. DOX double transgenic mice were GFAP tTA TRE IFN double transgenic animals fed cuprizone chow and released from doxycycline to induce expression of IFN .

Demyelination was induced in 6 week old DOX and DOX male mice by feeding the mice a diet of milled mouse chow containing 0.2 cuprizone Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. for up to 6 weeks. Subsequently both groups of mice were returned to a normal diet for up to 3 weeks to allow remyelination to occur. All animal procedures were conducted in complete compliance with the NIH and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Chicago.

The effects of INF and MBP on demyelination were evaluated as the level of INF and MHC 1 the loss of oligodendrocytes and the expression of myelin genes.

The expression of IFN in these animals was examined by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA analysis as follows. Spinal cord and forebrains were removed rinsed in ice cold PBS and immediately homogenized in five volumes of PBS with complete protease cocktail Roche Indianapolis Ind. using a motorized homogenizer. After incubation on ice for 5 min the extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 10 min. The protein content of each extract was determined by the DC protein assay Bio Rad Hercules Calif. . ELISA assays were performed using Mouse IFN Quantikine ELISA kit R D system Minneapolis Minn. and MBP antibodies 1 1000 Sternberger Monoclonals according to the manufacture s instructions.

Real time PCR was used to determine the effect of INF on the expression of MHC 1. RNA was isolated from the corpus callosum Jurevics et al. 2002 using Trizol reagent Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. and treated with DNAseI Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. to eliminate genomic DNA. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for RT PCR kit Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . Real time PCR was performed with iQ supermix Bio Rad Hercules Calif. on a Bio Rad iQ real time PCR detection system Bio Rad Hercules Calif. . The primers and probes Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. Coralville Iowa for real time PCR were as follows 

The sense and antisense primers that were used in the PCR reaction for MHC 1 were ATTCCCCAAAGGCCCATGT SEQ ID NO 1 and GTCTCCACAAGCTCCATGTCC SEQ ID NO 2 respectively. The probe was MHC I probe TGCTGGGCCCTGGGCTTCTACC SEQ ID NO 3 

The effect of INF on the population of oligodendrocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of oligodendrocytes using an anti CC1 antibody APC7 1 50 EMD Biosciences Inc. La Jolla Calif. Immunohistochemistry was perfomed on brain sections obtained from mice that were first anesthetized mice and perfused through the left cardiac ventricle with 4 paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PBS. The brains were removed postfixed with paraformaldehyde cryopreserved in 30 sucrose embedded in OCT and frozen on dry ice. Frozen sections were cut in a cryostat at a thickness of 10 m. Coronal sections at the fornix region of the corpus callosum corresponding to Sidman sections 241 251 were selected for use and all comparative analyses were restricted to midline corpus callosum Sidman et al. 1971 Harvard Univ. Press Cambridge Mass. . For immunohistochemistry frozen sections were treated with 20 C. acetone blocked with PBS containing 10 NGS and 0.1 Triton X 100 and incubated overnight with the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution. Appropriate fluorochrome or enzyme labeled secondary antibodies Vector Laboratories Burlingame Calif. were used for detection. An antibody against CC1 APC7 1 50 EMD Biosciences Inc. La Jolla Calif. was used as a marker for mature oligodendrocytes. Antibody against MBP 1 1000 Sternberger Monoclonals Lutherville Mass. was used to verify the degree of myelination. Antibody against active caspase 3 1 50 Cell signaling Technology Beverly Mass. was used as a marker for apoptotic cells. Fluorescent stained sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI Vector Laboratories and visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using a Photometrics PXL CCD camera connected to an Apple Macintosh computer using the Open Lab software suite. Immunopositive cells were quantified by counting positive cells within the median of the corpus callosum confined to an area of 0.04 mm. Only those cells with nuclei observable by DAPI staining were counted. Each MBP immunostaining slide was scored on a scale of zero to four. A score of zero indicates complete demyelination and a score of four indicates normal myelination in the corpus callosum of adult mice.

Real time PCR was used as described above to determine the expression of the MBP PLP and CGT using the following primers adn probes MBP sense primer GCTCCCTGCCCCAGAAGT SEQ ID NO 4 MBP antisense primer TGTCACAATGTTCTTGAAGAAATGG SEQ ID NO 5 MBP probe AGCACGGCCGGACCCAAGATG SEQ ID NO 6 

PLP sense primer CACTTACAACTTCGCCGTCCT SEQ ID NO 7 PLP antisense primer GGGAGTTTCTATGGGAGCTCAGA SEQ ID NO 8 PLP probe AACTCATGGGCCGAGGCACCAA SEQ ID NO 9 

CGT sense primer TTATCGGAAATTCACAAGGATCAA SEQ ID NO 10 and CGT antisense primer TGGCGAAGAATGTAGTCTATCCAATA SEQ ID NO 11 CGT probe CCGGCCACCCTGTCAATCGG SEQ ID NO 12 . The degree of demyelination was determined as the level of MBP was also determined by immunohistochemical analysis as described above and using an antibody against MBP 1 1000 Stemberger Monoclonals Lutherville Mass. . Demyelination was also assessed by electron microscopy as follows. Mice were anesthetized and perfused with 0.1 M PBS containing 4 paraformaldehyde and 2.5 glutaraldehyde PH 7.3 . Brains were sliced into 1 mm sections and the section corresponding to the region of the fornix was trimmed and processed for analysis and oriented so that a cross section of the corpus callosum was achieved. Thin sections were cut stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and analyzed as previously described Coetzee et al. 1996 86 209 219 . The total percent of remyelinated axons was based on the analysis of a minimum of 300 fibers per mouse.

The results show that DOX mice did not express IFN in the forebrain for the duration of the study while the DOX mice began expressing approximately 20 pg mg of INF in the forebrain after 2 weeks of cuprizone treatment and removal of doxycycline . Real time PCR analysis showed that the increased level of INF led to a significant increase in the expression of major histocompatibility complex MHC class I MHC I a downstream target of INF signaling in the corpus callosum during remyelination . After 5 weeks of cuprizone treatment demyelination in the corpus callosum of both DOX and DOX double transgenic mice reached maximum levels and axons were almost completely demyelinated . Also at this time CC1 positive mature oligodendrocytes were lost within the lesion site in both DOX and DOX double transgenic mice . Furthermore during the period of demyelination at 2 and 4 weeks of treatment with cuprizone there was a reduction in the expression of the myelin genes MBP proteolipid protein PLP and ceramide galactosyltransferase CGT that was comparable between DOX and DOX double transgenic mice .

These data suggest that the presence of IFN does not have a significant effect on the initial pathological processes induced by cuprizone exposure.

Statistics. Data are expressed as mean standard deviation. Multiple comparisons were statistically evaluated by one way AVONA test using Sigmastat 3.1 software. Differences were considered statistically significant if p

The effect of IFN on the remyelination in the cuprizone treated mice described in Example 1 was determined following withdrawal of cuprizone at week 5. The experimental methods used are the same as described in Example 1.

Remyelination occurs by the repopulation of demyelinated lesions by oligodendrocyte precursors OPCs at the site of the lesion where they differentiate into oligodendrocytes Matsushima et al. 2001 Brain Pathol. 11 107 116 Mason et al. 2000 J. Neurosci. Res. 61 251 262 . CC1 positive oligodendrocytes are derived from NG2 positive OPCs Watanabe et al 1998 Mason et al 2000 . Therefore repopulation of a lesion may be evaluated by the presence of CC1 and or NG2 positive cells.

The effect of INF on the repopulation of demyelinated lesions by oligodendrocyte precursors OPC was evaluated in the mice of Example 2 as the number of CC1 positive mature oligodendrocytes and NG2 positive OPCs that were counted in sections from the corpus callosum of both DOX and DOX mice. The methods used for analyzing the oligodendrocytes during remyelination is the same as that described in Example 2. Immunostaining of NG2 in OPCs was performed using NG2 antibodies 1 50 Chemicon .

After 6 weeks of cuprizone exposure the CC1 positive oligodendrocytes began to reappear 42.5 2.1 0.04 mm2 within the demyelinated corpus callosum of control DOX mice and reached 228.7 20.2 0.04 mm2 at 8 weeks. However in the DOX double transgenic animals there was a dramatic reduction in the number of CC1 positive oligodendrocytes within the corpus callosum at the same point in time 8 weeks 78 12.7 0.04 mm2 . At week 4 of cuprizone treatement INF increased significantly the number of NG2 positive OPCs in the corpus callosum of the DOX mice when compared to the number counted in the DOX animals DOX 46 4.24 versus DOX 19 2.12 0.04 mm p

The data indicate that the reduction in the number of CC1 positive oligodendrocytes contributes to the poor remyelination of demyelinated lesions in the presence of INF and that INF delays the recruitment of OPCs to the site of lesion without significantly affecting the number of OPCs that are recruited.

Double transgenic mice that allow for temporally regulated delivery of INF to the CNS Lin et al. J Neurosci 24 10074 10083 2004 were used to assess the role of INF in the pathogenesis of EAE. GFAP tTA TRE IFN double transgenic mice as described in Example 1 were used to determine the effect of INF on the demyelination caused by EAE. All mice were fed doxycycline from the day of conception to repress the expression of INF and were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte protein MOG35 55 to induce EAE. At day 7 postimmunization PID7 doxycycline was withdrawn from the experimental group PID7 DOX .

The level of INF was determined in the control DOX and the PID7 DOX mice using an ELISA immunoassay as described in Example 1 and the severity of the disease was assessed as a function of a clinical score. Clinical severity scores were recorded daily according to a 0 5 point scale where 0 healthy 1 flaccid tail 2 ataxia and or paresis of hind limbs 3 paralysis of hind limbs and or paresis of forelimbs 4 tetraparalysis and 5 moribund or dead.

The spinal cord from DOX and DOX animals with EAE was immunostained for MBP and the remyelination of axons was evaluated. The number of oligodendrocytes was determined in the spine from DOX and DOX mice as the number of CC1 positive cells. Axonal damage was evaluted by immunostaining of non phosphorylated neurofilament H. Antibodies to non phosphorylated neurofilament H were SM132 diluted to 1 1000 and obtained from Sternberger Monoclonals.

The results from the ELISA assay showed that the level of INF in both DOX and DOX mice was similar 60 pg mg at the peak of the disease PID17. At PID50 the levels of INF were significantly greater in the DOX mice 40.24 pg mg than in the control DOX mice 6.22 pg mg .

The mean maximum clinical score at PID17 was similar for the DOX and DOX PID17 mice DOX 2.66 0.80 and DOX 2.69 0.69 respectively . At this time twenty of 25 control mice and 24 of 30 DOX mice developed hind limb paralysis. The control mice began recovering from EAE by day 21 and by day 50 PID50 the control DOX mice were indistinguishable from naive mice. However at PID50 half of the DOX mice 12 24 that had developed hind limb paralysis characteristic of EAE continued to suffer from the paralysis at a time when recovery was seen in the control group PID50 . While the clinical score of control DOX mice had decreased to less than 1 at PID50 the score for the DOX mice remained at almost 2 .

At PID7 the level of MBP was notably reduced in the lumbar spinal cord of DOX mice when compared to that of the DOX mice . Toluidine blue staining showed that a large number of axons from the DOX mice were unmyelinated while the axons from the DOX mice had very few unmyelinated axons . The number of CC1 positive oligodendrocytes was significantly decreased at PID50 in the DOX animals . Immunostaining of non phosphorylated neurofilament H was imilar in DOX and DOX mice thus indicating that axonal damage was not affected by INF .

These data show that INF delays the recovery from EAE and that the failure to remyelinate caused by INF contributed to the poor recovery of the DOX mice.

INF is known to induce MHC antigens and activate macrophages and T lymphocytes. The inflammatory effect of INF was studied in the CNS during remyelination by determining the infiltration of T cells and macrophages and measuring the expression of MHC 1 TNF a IL 2 IL 12 and IL 17. Immunohistochemistry was performed in tissues from the DOX and DOX mice with EAE as described in Example 4. Experimental procedures were followed as described in the examples above.

Immunostaining of CD3 CD3 antibody 1 50 Santa Cruz Santa Cruz Calif. and CD11b CD11b antibodies 1 50 Chemicon Tenecula Calif. showed that INF did not increase significantly the number of infiltrating T cells and macrophages in the lumbar spinal cord of DOX adn DOX mice and B . Real time PCR analysis revealed that INF increased the expression of MHC 1 TNF a IL2 and IL 12 and decrease the expression of IL 17 in DOX mice when compared to the DOX animals. INF did not alter the expression of iNOs and IL 23 . The probes and primers that were used are MHC I sense primer ATTCCCCAAAGGCCCATGT SEQ ID 1

These data indicate that INF modestly enhances the immune response in demyelinated lesions at the recovery stage of EAE and might thereby contribute to the remyelination failure elicited by this cytokine.

Repression of remyelination by INF is associated with ER stress. Oligodendrocytes have been shown to be highly sensitive to disruption of protein synthesis and perturbation of the secretory pathway Pfeiffer et al. 1993 3 191 197 Southwood et al. 2002 36 585 596 Leegwater et al. 2001 29 383 388 . To determine whether IFN interferes with endoplasmic reticulum ER function in remyelinating oligodendrocytes the expression of ER stress markers was monitored in the corpus callosum of mice expressing IFN . The study was performed using the transgenic mice described in Example 1.

The level of mRNA encoding ER stress associated genes binding immunoglobulin protein 78 KDa glucose regulated protein BIP GRP78 and the CAATT enhancer binding protein homologous protein growth and DNA damage protein 153 CHOP GADD153 was determined using real time PCR as described in Example 1 in the corpus callosum of the cuprizone treated mice of Example 1. The probes sense and antisense primers that were used were

The level of phosphorylated eIF 2 which inhibits nucleotide exchange on the eIF 2 complex and attenuates most protein synthesis was analyzed by Western blot and the expression was colocalized by immunostaining CC1 antibodies as described above. Western blot analysis was performed as follows. The corpus callosum from 3 mice was rinsed in ice cold phosphate buffered saline PBS and pooled and immediately homogenized in 5 volumes of Triton X 100 buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 1 Triton X 100 10 glycerol 1 mM EDTA 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate 100 mM NaF 17.5 mM glycerophosphate 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 15 g ml aprotonin and 6 g ml pepstatin A using a motorized homogenizer. After incubation on ice for 15 min the extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm twice for 30 min each. The protein content of each extract was determined by protein assay Bio Rad . The extracts 40 g were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with primary antibody see below and the signal was revealed by chemiluminescence after reacting with horseradish peroxidase conjugated second antibody. The following primary antibodies were used anti eIF 2 1 500 Santa Cruz Santa Cruz Calif. anti p eIF 2c 1 1000 Cell signaling Technology anti CHOP 1 500 Santa Cruz and anti actin 1 1000 Sigma St Louis Mo. .

The level of mRNA for BIP and CHOP which are associated with the ER stress response were increased approximately 2 fold in the corpus callosum of DOX double transgenic mice compared to control DOX animals . Elevated levels of the CHOP protein approximately 1.7 fold were also observed in the corpus callosum of DOX double transgenic mice by Western blot analysis . Western blot analysis also revealed that INF elevated the level of phosphorylated eIF 2 p eIF 2 by approximately 1.8 fold in the corpus callosum of the same DOX animals. Furthermore colocalization analysis using the CC1 antibody revealed that remyelinating oligodendrocytes displayed increased levels of p eIF 2 .

These results indicate that the detrimental effect of INF on remyelination is associated with the activation of the ER stress pathway.

The involvement of the ER stress response in the reduction caused by INF to remyelinate lesions was examined in transgenic mice that were generated to be heterozygous for a loss of function mutation in pancreatic ER kinase PERK Harding et al. 2001 Mol Cell 7 1153 1163 and to be temporally regulated for expressing INF in the CNS. TRE IFN mice were first crossed with PERK mice Harding et al. 2001 7 1153 1163 on the C57BL 6 background to generate mice the carry the PERK mutation and the resulting progeny were crossed to GFAP tTA mice to obtain transgenic mice that were heterozygous for the PERK mutation. The effect of PERK on remyelination in the presence or absence of INF was evaluated as evaluated as a function of the level of meylination of oligodendrocytes in remyelinating lesions and the number of oligodendrocytes present in the remyelinating lesion.

The extent of remyelination was assessed as described in the previous examples in the corpus callosum of PERK and PERK mice that were made to express INF DOX PERK and DOX PERK and in mice in which the expression of INF was repressed DOX PERK and DOX PERK . Remyelination was determined by electron microscopy and was related to the number of CC1 positive oligodendrocytes and the level of caspase 3 expression in the corpus callosum of all animals. The level of caspase 3 was determined by immunohistochemical methods using anti capsase antibody active casoase 3 antibody 1 50 Cel Signaling Technology and according to the method described in Example 1. Demyelination was induced in six week old GFAP tTA TRE INF double transgenic mice on a PERK background that had been maintained on doxycycline by simultaneously treating the mice with 0.2 cuprizone and releasing them from doxycycline DOX PERK . Remyelination was allowed to occur by withdrawing cuprizone at week 6.

Immunohistochemistry and EM analysis of CC1 positive oligodndrocytes revealed that a loss of function in PERK did not affect the demyelination process during cuprizone treatment data not shown . In contrast GFAP tTA TRE IFN PERK mice that were released from doxycycline at the time of cuprizone exposure DOX PERK had significantly fewer remyelinated axons at 9 weeks 15.6 7.6 3 weeks after cuprizone was removed from the diet than the double transgenic mice on a PERK background DOX PERK 54.0 4.3 vs 31.1 7.6 p

The number of CC1 positive oligodendrocytes that was significantly lower 123.2 27.5 0.04 mm in the DOX PERK mice than in the DOX PERK animals 283.2 27.7 0.04 mm p

These data indicate that ER stress response is associated with the failure to remyelinate and the reduction of oligodendrocyte numbers elicited by IFN and that PERK is essential for remyelination during ER stress.

To test whether apoptosis of oligodendrocytes that is induced by INF affects ER stress the effect on the morphology the degree of apoptosis and the expression of ER markers was studied in a culture of oligodendrocyte precursor cells OPC . Oligodendrocyte progenitors were cultured from neonatal rat brains Baerwald et al. 1998 52 230 239 . A mixed glial culture was grown in flasks in medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum FBS and when the astrocyte layer became confluent 10 14 days oligodendrocyte progenitors were separated from astrocytes and microglia using an orbital shaker. Cells greater than 95 of which were A2B5 positive GFAP negative and CD11b negative were cultured in 0.5 FBS containing medium which also contained PDGF 10 ng ml and FGF 5 ng ml both from R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. . Then cells were switched to 0.5 FBS medium without PDGF and FGF for differentiation. After 5 days in the differentiating medium approximately 40 of cells were positive for myelin protein 2 3 cyclic nucleotide 3 phosphodiestaerase CNP . 70 U ml recombinant rat INF Calbiochem La Jolla Calif. was added to the cells that had been allowed to differentiation for 5 days. After 5 d in the differentiatiating medium about 40 of the cells were CNP positive. 70 U ml of recombinant rat INF Calbiochem was added to the cells that had been allowed to differentiate for 5 d. To examine the oligodendroglial response to general ER stress inducing agents progenitor cells that had been cultured in differentaition medium for 5 or 7 days were treated with 2 g ml of tunicamycin Sigma Aldrich for 6 hours.

The level of apoptosis of the OPC cells was determined by double staining CNP 1 200 Sternberger Monoclonals Lutherville Md. and TUNEL using the ApopTag Kit Serologicals Corp. Norcross Calif. and following the manufacturer s instructions. Apoptosis was also evaluated by measuring the activity of caspase 3 in oligodendrocyte lysates using the Fluorimetric Caspase 3 Assay Kit Sigma St. Louis Mo. according to the manufacturer s instructions.

To determine whether INF affects ER function the RNA expression of ER markers binding immunoglobulin protein BIP CAAT enhancer binding protein homologous protein CHOP and caspase 12 was determined using real time PCR. RNA was isolated from cultured cells and mice brain using Trizol reagent Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. and treated with DNAaseI Invitrogen to eliminate genomic DNA. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for RT PCR kit Invitrogen . Real time PCR was performed with iQ Supermix Bio Rad Hercules Calif. on a Bio Rad iQ real time PCR detection system Bio Rad . The following primers and probes Integrated DNA Technologies Inc.

To determine the effect of INF on the level of phosphorylated eIF 2 and caspase 12 proteins western blot analysis was performed using the following antibodies anti eIF 2 1 500 Santa Cruz anti p eIF 2 1 1000 Cell signaling Technology anti caspase 12 1 5.00 Santa Cruz and anti actin 1 1000 Sigma St Louis Mo. and according to the following protocol. Tissues or cultured cells were rinsed in ice cold phosphate buffered saline PBS and then immediately homogenized in 5 volumes of Triton X 100 buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 1 Triton X 100 10 glycerol 1 mM EDTA 10 mM tetrasodium pyrophosphate 100 mM NaF 17.5 mM glycerophosphate 10 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 15 g ml aprotonin and 6 g ml pepstatin A using a motorized homogenizer. After incubation on ice for 15 min the extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm twice for 30 min each. The protein content of each extract was determined by protein assay Bio Rad .

The blots were incubated with primary antibody see below and the signal was revealed by chemiluminescence after reacting with horseradish peroxidase conjugated second antibody.

Purified oligodendrocyte progenitor cells OPCs were allowed to differentiate for five days in defined media at which point approximately 40 of the cells expressed the myelin protein 2 3 cyclic nucleotide 3 phosphodiesterase CNP and extended branched processes . These cells did not extend the flat membrane sheets that are characteristic of more mature oligodendrocyte cultures. When treated with 70 U ml INF for 48 h these cells showed abnormal morphological changes including cell shrinkage and aggregation of cell bodies followed by detachment from the culture plate . Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase TdT dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL and CNP double labeling revealed that IFN induced apoptosis in a significant number of oligodendrocytes D and E . Furthermore the caspase 3 activity in the cell lysates of IFN treated oligodendrocytes was markedly increased . Thus 70 U ml of IFN is able to induce apoptosis in oligodendrocytes that are actively synthesizing myelin components.

To determine whether INF interferes with ER function the expression of markers of ER stress were monitored in cytokine treated oligodendrocyte cultures. The levels of mRNA encoding the binding immunoglobulin protein 78 KDa glucose regulated protein BIP GRP78 and the CAATT enhancer binding protein homologous protein growth and DNA damage protein 153 CHOP GADD153 both of which are associated with the ER stress response were increased approximately 2 to 3 times in oligodendrocytes after exposure to IFN . The phosphorylation of eIF 2 which inhibits nucleotides exchange on the eIF 2 complex and attenuates most protein synthesis occurs within minutes following the development of ER stress Ron 2002 . Western blot analysis revealed that INF significantly elevated the level of phosphorylated eIF 2 p eIF 2 in oligodendroglial cultures . Caspase 12 an ER localized caspase is activated by ER stress and can lead to cleavage of caspase 3 Nakagawa et al. 2000 403 98 103 Lamkanfi et al. 2004 11 365 368 . The induction of caspase 12 was observed after treatment of oligodendrocytes with INF . Moreover the level of the active fragment of caspase 12 was strongly elevated after 48 h of INF treatment . These results indicate that IFN induced apoptosis in cultured oligodendrocytes is associated with the activation of the ER stress pathway.

Forty percent of the purified oligodendrocyte progenitor cells OPCs that had been allowed to differentiate for five days in defined media expressed the myelin protein 2 3 cyclic nucleotide 3 phosphodiesterase CNP and extended branched processes . These cells did not extend the flat membrane sheets that are characteristic of more mature oligodendrocyte cultures. When treated with 70 U ml INF for 48 h these cells showed abnormal morphological changes including cell shrinkage and aggregation of cell bodies followed by detachment from the culture plate .

To study the effect of INF on the myelination of oligodendrocytes during mouse development transgenic mice that allow for temporally regulated delivery of INF to the CNS using the tetracycline tet controllable system Lin et al. 2004 24 10074 10083 were generated. To drive tTA expression in astrocytes the transcriptional regulatory region of the glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP gene was chosen Brenner et al. 1994 14 1030 1037 . GFAP tTA mice were mated with TRE IFN mice to produce animals hemizygous for both transgenes. When these mice are maintained on doxycycline DOX expression of the INF transgene is repressed when the double transgenic mice are released from doxycycline DOX INF is expressed. For the purpose of these experiments mice received doxycycline up to day 14 of development E14 at which time the experimental animals DOX stopped receiving doxycycline while the control animals DOX were continuosly fed the dug. The mRNA for INF could be detected in the DOX mice as early as 10 days after birth data not shown .

Real time PCR analysis was performed to determine the levels of expression of INF MHC 1 BIP CHOP and caspase 12. The primers for the PCR reactions for BIP CHP and caspase 12 are given in example 1. The sense and antisense primers for INF were GATATCTCGAGGAACTGGCAAAA SEQ ID NO 39 and CTTCAAAGAGTCTGAGGTAGAAAGAGATAAT SEQ ID NO 40 respectively and the sense and antisense primers for MHC 1 were MHC I sense primer ATTCCCCAAAGGCCCATGT SEQ ID NO 1 and MHC I antisense primer GTCTCCACAAGCTCCATGTCC SEQ ID NO 2 .

Western blot analysis was performed on the CNS of 14 day old mice to determine the expression of caspase 12 as described in Example 6.

Brain and spinal cord tissue were analyzed using immunohistochemical methods as follows. Anesthetized mice were perfused through the left cardiac ventricle with 4 paraformaldehyde in 0.1M PBS. The half saggital brains and transcervical spinal cord were removed postfixed with paraformaldehyde cryopreserved in 30 sucrose embedded in OCT and frozen on dry ice. Frozen sections were cut in a cryostat at a thickness of 10 m. Coronal sections at the fornix region of the corpus callosum corresponding to Sidman sections 241 251 were selected for use and all comparative analyses were restricted to midline corpus callosum Sidman et al. 1971 Harvard Univ. Press Cambridge Mass. . For immunohistochemistry frozen sections were treated with 20 C. acetone blocked with PBS containing 10 NGS and 0.1 Triton X 100 and incubated overnight with the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution. Appropriate fluorochrome or enzyme labeled secondary antibodies Vector Laboratories Burlingame Calif. were used for detection. An antibody against CC1 APC7 1 50 EMD Biosciences Inc. La Jolla Calif. was used as a marker for mature oligodendrocytes. Antibody against MBP 1 1000 Sternberger Monoclonals Lutherville Mass. was used to verify the degree of myelination. Antibody against active caspase 3 1 50 Cell signaling Technology Beverly Mass. was used as a marker for apoptotic cells. Fluorescent stained sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI Vector Laboratories and visualized with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using a Photometrics PXL CCD camera connected to an Apple Macintosh computer using the Open Lab software suite. Immunopositive cells were quantified by counting positive cells within the median of the corpus callosum confined to an area of 0.04 mm. Only those cells with nuclei observable by DAPI staining were counted. Each MBP immunostaining slide was scored on a scale of zero to four. A score of zero indicates complete demyelination and a score of four indicates normal myelination in the corpus callosum of adult mice.

Real time PCR analysis showed that the DOX mice expressed robust levels of INF and major histocompatibility complex MHC class I a downstream target of INF activity in the CNS at postnatal day PND 14 . The double transgenic mice that ectopically expressed INF DOX in the CNS during development were mildly hypomyelinated see which is consistent with observations made on transgenic mice that were previously generated to express IFN constitutively in oligodendrocytes Corbin et al. 1996 7 354 370 . The diminished myelination observed in these mice is correlated with IFN induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis see . IFN upregulated BIP and CHOP expression approximately 1.6 and 2 times the control levels and strongly enhanced caspase 12 expression in the CNS of these animals . More notably the level of the active fragment of caspase 12 was also increased in the CNS of these animals . Furthermore colocalization analysis with the CC1 antibody revealed that oligodendrocytes increased expression of BIP p eIF 2 and caspase 12 .

These data support the link between ER stress and IFN induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis and hypomyelination during development.

To examine the involvement of the ER stress response induced by INF the involvement of the PERK enzyme was evaluated using transgenic mice that are heterozygous for a loss of function of mutation in pancreatic ER kinase PERK Harding et al. 2001 7 1153 1163 . The phenotype of the transgenic animals was analyzed as a function of the level of p eIF 2 was evaluated in the PERK mice.

GFAP tTA and TRE INF double transgenic mice described in Example 1 were crossed with PERK mice and the resulting progeny were intercrossed to obtain double transgenic mice that were homozygous or heterozygous for the PERK mutation The majority of the double transgenic mice with a PERK background died within 12 days after birth regardless of whether they received doxycycline during the entire period or if doxycycline was interchanged with water at embryonic day 14 E14 . Double transgenic GFAP tTA TRE INF mice on a PERK background released from doxycycline at E14 E14 DOX PERK showed the expected minor tremor and ataxia but good survival. In contrast the double transgenic mice on a PERK background E14 DOX PERK had a much more severe phenotype. These animals were considerably smaller than IFN expressing PERK littermates or PERK animals that did not inherit the combination of GFAP tTA and TRE IFN alleles and showed severe tremor and ataxia and approximately two thirds of these mice experienced tonic seizures. Strikingly more than 90 of the double transgenic mice that were released from doxycycline at E14 on a PERK background died by post natal day PND 27 whereas double transgenic mice on a wild type background displayed normal survival .

The level of phosphorylted eIF 2 p eIF 2 was determined severity of the phenotype of the mice was evaluated. The level of p eIF 2 was significantly greater in the oligodendrocytes from PERK mice when compared to that measured in the PERK mice and F whereas a modest increase in p eIF 2 was seen in the CNS of the PERK mice and C . The loss of function mutation in pERK did not significantly affect the RNA level of BIP CHOP and Caspase 12 .

These results suggest that the reduced capacity to elevate p eIF 2 levels in response to IFN contributes to the severe phenotype in mice misexpressing IFN on a PERK background.

The tremoring phenotype with tonic seizures displayed by the PERK mice that express IFN in the CNS as described in Example 3 is suggestive of myelin perturbations. To evaluate the level of myelination in the PERK mice the state of myelination was evaluated by immunostaining for MBP was performed in the CNS of 14 day old GFAP tTA TRE IFN PERK mice released from doxycycline at E 14 and compared to that of double transgenic mice on a wild type background . Immunostaining for myelin basic protein MBP was notably reduced in the CNS of 14 day old GFAP tTA TRE IFN PERK mice released from doxycycline at E 14 compared with double transgenic mice on a wild type background . Moreover ultrastructural examination revealed that the majority 81 14.9 of axons in the spinal cord of PERK mice that express IFN in the CNS were unmyelinated . In contrast double transgenic animals on a wild type background released from doxycycline at E14 displayed considerably fewer unmyelinated axons 30 12.9 whereas animals maintained continuously on doxycycline to repress IFN expression had even fewer unmyelinated axons 9.8 6.1 .

These data establish a correlation between the severe tremoring phenotype induced by INF on the PERK background and hypomyelination.

To gain insight into the cellular mechanisms that account for the hypomyelination displayed by the PERK mice that express INF in the CNS the status of oligodendrocyte function in these animals was examined We determined the steady state levels of mRNAs encoding the myelin markers MBP PLP and ceramide galactosyltransferase CGT . Real time PCR analysis showed that the MBP PLP and CGT mRNA levels in the brains of 14 day old double transgenic mice on a wild type background released from doxycycline at E 14 were slightly lower than normal. These mRNA levels were even lower in the CNS of GFAP tTA TRE IFN PERK mice released from doxycycline at E 14 . To determine if the decreased steady state levels of myelin protein encoding mRNAs was due to reduced numbers of myelinating cells we determined oligodendroglial numbers in these mice. Compared with control mice there were slightly fewer oligodendrocytes identified by CC1 immunostaining in the CNS of 14 day old GFAP tTA TRE INF transgenic mice on a wild type background released from doxycycline at E 14 . In contrast very few oligodendrocytes could be detected in the corpus callosum and cerebellum of IFN expressing transgenic mice on a PERK background and oligodendrocyte numbers in the spinal cord of these mice were decreased by more than 50 .

In addition the number of oligodendrocytes that were TUNEL positive in the cervical spinal cord of these mice was 2.5 times higher than the number of such cells in double transgenic mice on a wild type background following release from doxycycline at E 14 C D E and F . Moreover ultrastructural examination showed that apoptotic oligodendrocytes contained highly condensed chromatin mass intact membrane shrunken cytoplasm and apoptotic body . These data reinforce the hypothesis that INF damages oligodendrocytes by means of the ER stress pathway and indicate that PERK plays a critical role in protecting oligodendrocytes from the detrimental consequences of IFN induced ER stress.

Compared with the actively myelinating oligodendrocytes of young growing animals oligodendrocytes in adult mice produce lower levels of membrane proteins and lipids just enough to maintain homeostasis in the myelin structure Morell et al. 1999 Philadelphia Pa. Lippincott Raven Publishers 69 93 . The ER of oligodendrocytes in adult animals may thus have more spare capacity to process increased protein load and as such may be less sensitive to disruptions of the protein secretory pathway. To examine this possibility double transgenic mice were allowed to develop to maturity at which time INF expression in the CNS was initiated. Real time PCR analysis showed that double transgenic animals released from doxycycline at 4 weeks of age started expressing INF at approximately 6 weeks of age and the levels of INF mRNA and protein in the CNS were comparable with those in developing mice released from doxycycline at E 14 data not shown . IFN did not affect oligodendrocyte survival in adult mice even in mice on a PERK background C D and E . Moreover ultrastructural examination revealed normal myelin in the CNS of 10 week old double transgenic mice with a wild type or a PERK background that were released from doxycycline at 4 weeks of age G H and I . A modest induction of BIP and CHOP by INF was observed in the cerebellum of 10 week old double transgenic mice released from doxycycline at 4 weeks of age . Nevertheless colocalization analysis showed that mature oligodendrocytes did not significantly increase BIP expression C D and E .

Thus the data indicate that oligodendrocytes from adult animals are less sensitive to the presence of INF than are actively myelinating oligodendrocytes of growing juvenile mice.

Double transgenic mice that allow for temporally regulated delivery of INF to the CNS Lin et al. J Neurosci 24 10074 10083 2004 were used to assess the role of INF in the pathogenesis of EAE. GFAP tTA TRE IFN double transgenic mice as described in the Examples above were used to determine the effect of INF on the demyelination caused by EAE. All mice were fed doxycycline from the day of conception to repress the expression of INF and the experimental group were later immunized with MOG 35 55 peptide to induce the development to EAE. For induction of EAE mice received subcutaneous injections at flanks and tail base of 200 g MOG 35 55 peptide emulsified in complete Freund s adjuvant Difco supplemented with 600 g of strain H37Ra Difco . 2 intraperitoneal injections of 400 ng pertussis toxin List Biological Laboratories were given 24 and 72 h later. Clinical score 0 healthy 1 flaccid tail 2 ataxia and or paresis of hindlimbs 3 paralysis of hindlimbs and or paresis of forelimbs 4 tetraparalysis 5 moribund or death were recorded daily. The control animals were continuously fed doxycycline DOX double mice while the experimental animals DOX double mice were deprived of the antibiotic to allow for the expression of INF . The effect of INF was monitored as follows.

The onset of disease was evident at day 14 in both DOX and DOX double animals and no significant differences in clinical score were seen at that time PID14 post immunization day 14 . However DOX double mice developed significantly milder disease than the DOX double mice and only 2 of 25 animals in the DOX group showed hind limb paralysis while a significantly greater portion 20 25 of the DOX double mice had limb paralysis and Table 1 

Real time PCR analysis was performed to assess the level of expression of INF in the spinal cord of DOX and DOX animals. Anesthetized mice were perfused with PBS. RNA was isolated from the spinal cord using Trizol reagent Invitrogen and treated with DNAseI Invitrogen to eliminate genomic DNA. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for RT PCR kit Invitrogen . Taqman real time PCR was performed with iQ supermix Bio Rad on a Bio Rad iQ real time PCR detection system as previously described shows that the levels of IFN in the spinal cord of the DOX animals became detectable at EAE onset PID14 reached peak at the peak of disease PID17 then decreased at the recovery stage of disease PID22 .

The level of IFN mRNA in the spinal cord of DOX animals was significantly higher than than that of the DOX mice at all times PID14 PID17 and PID22 . In addition for transgenic IFN could be detected in the spinal cord of DOX double mice as early as PID14 . Thus these data show that delivery of IFN to the CNS at the time of onset of EAE significantly attenuates the development of the severity of the disease.

Real time PCR analysis of the expression of various cytokines in the spinal cord of DOX and DOX animals at PID14 showed that INF increased the expression of iNOs TNF a IL 2 IL 12 and IL 10 but did not affect the expression of IL 2 and IL 5 .

Histopathological evaluation of the effect of INF on demylination caused by EAE was performed on the spinal cord of the DOX and DOX animals at the peak of the disease PID17 . The spinal cord of the DOX animals showed destruction of myelin sheaths axon damage oligodendrocyte loss B and C and perivascular inflammation which are characteristic of the histopathology that is typical of EAE. In contrast myelin axons and oligodendrocytes from the lumbar spinal cord of DOX animals remained almost intact B and C and CD3 positive T cell infiltration was lower than that seen i the DOX animals . Moreover the mRNA level of myelin basic protein MBP in the spinal cord of DOX double mice as assessed by real time PCR revealed that MBP mRNA was not significantly decreased by EAE when compared to MBP mRNA levels in age matched na ve mice. However the level of MBP mRNA was decreased by 30 in the DOX double mice .

During EAE pathogenesis T cells are primed in peripheral immune system and enter the CNS well before the onset of clinical disease Hickey et al. 1991 J Neurosci Res 28 254 260. To determine whether the effect of INF in protecting the CNS from the demyelinating effect of EAE results from the anti inflammatory activity of INF the level of T cell and monocyte infiltration was assessed and the expression of known inflammatory cytokines evaluated.

The results shown in show that INF did not significantly affect CD3 positive T cell infiltration but increased CD11b positive monocyte infiltration in the spinal cord at EAE onset . Importantly real time PCR analyses showed that delivery of INF to the CNS strongly enhanced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOs tumor necrosis factor TNF interleukin 2 IL 2 IL 12 and IL 10 in the spinal cord at EAE onset but did not significantly affect the expression of iNOs or TNF at the peak of disease . In addition CNS delivery of IFN did not change CD11b positive monocyte infiltration at the peak of disease .

These data suggest that it is unlikely that IFN protects EAE induced demyelination due to its anti inflammatory properties a hypothesis that has been proposed by some investigators Muhl et al. Int. Immunopharmacol 3 1247 1255 2005 .

Oligodendrocyte death has been shown to modulate inflammatory infiltration in EAE lesions Hisahara et al. EMBO J 19 341 348 2000 Hisahara et al. 2001 J Exp Med 193 111 122 . It is possible that while INF promotes an inflammatory response at the onset of EAE the inhibitory effect of INF on the death of oligodendrocytes at a later stage of disease may explain the decrease in T cell infiltration. Our previous findings have shown that transgenic mice that express INF under the control of the MBP gene are resistant to oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination induced by cuprizone Gao et al. 2000 Mol Cell Neurosci 16 338 349 . It is thought that the oligodendrocytes that are injured by cuprizone go though apoptosis Matsushima and Morell 2001 Brain Pathol 11 107 116 which is closely followed by the recruitment of microglia and phagocytosis of myelin. In the cuprizone animal model it is known that the demyelination oligodendrocyte apoptosis do not involve T cells or a breakdown of the blood brain barrier.

Therefore these data suggest that IFN protects oligodendrocytes from demyelination through a cytoprotective effect.

Demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss are the hallmarks of multiple sclerosis MS and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE . It has long been known that low levels of stress that activate downstream signaling pathways without causing severe cell injury can protect against subsequent exposure to more severe stressful events. Pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase PERK encodes an ER stress inducible kinase that phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 eIF2 and enhances the stress induced expression of numerous cytoprotective genes Harding et al. 1999 397 271 274 Lu et al. 2004 23 169 179 Harding et al. 2003 11 619 633 .

To determine whether the PERK pathway mediates the protective effects of INF from demyelination induced by EAE the level of phosphorylated PERK p PERK and phosphorylated eIF2 p eIF2 was monitored in oligodendrocytes during the course of EAE.

Colocalitation analysis with the CC1 antibody revealed that a few oligodendrocytes were p PERK positive and p eIF2 positive in the spinal cord of control mice at EAE onset consistent with a previous report Chakrabarty et al. 2004 . In contrast CNS delivery of INF markedly activated the PERK eIF2 pathway in oligodendrocytes .

These data support a link between the activation of the PERK pathway in oligodendrocytes and a protective role of INF in EAE induced demyelination.

A genetics based approach was used to examine the involvement of the PERK pathway in the protective effects of INF on EAE. Mice that are heterozygous for a loss of function mutation in PERK are phenotypically healthy but display evidence of haploid insufficiency Harding et al. 2000 Lin et al. 2005 . TRE IFN mice were crossed with PERK mice and their progeny was crossed with GFAP tTA mice to obtain triple transgenic mice that were heterozygous for the PERK mutation. Six week old GFAP tTA TRE IFN triple transgenic mice with a PERK background that had received doxycycline since conception were immunized with the MOG35 55 peptide and were either simultaneously withdrawn from doxycycline DOX triple mice or continued to receive doxycycline DOX triple mice . The control DOX triple mice showed an EAE disease course similar to that of control DOX double mice Strikingly CNS delivery of IFN did not ameliorate EAE in mice heterozygous for the PERK mutation. Morbidity rates EAE severity and mortality rates for DOX triple mice were comparable with those for control DOX triple mice Table 1 . Neuropathologic analyses revealed that CNS delivery of INF at EAE onset did not prevent demyelination axon damage or oligodendrocyte loss in the lumbar spinal cord of mice with a PERK background at the peak of disease. In fact MBP immunostaining toluidine blue staining and real time PCR analysis for MBP consistently showed comparable demyelination in the spinal cord of DOX triple mice and control DOX triple mice at the peak of disease severity . In addition we found that the loss of function mutation in PERK did not significantly affect inflammatory infiltration and the expression profile of cytokines in the course of EAE. Therefore these data show that the activation of the PERK pathway by IFN in oligodendrocytes is essential for protecting neurons against demyelination caused by EAE. This suggests that IFN activates an integrated stress response which is dependent on PERK pathway that provides protection against subsequent exposure to harmful agents to the neuronal system.

The role of GADD 34 in demyelination was studied in mice lacking GADD 34 and in which EAE was induced.

Activation of eIF2 has been observed in oligodendrocytes during EAE Chakrabarty et al 2004 Chakrabarty et al. 2005 . As described in the examples above CNS delivery of INF at EAE onset has been shown to protect against EAE induced demyelination and to attenuate the severity of the disease by activating the PERK dependent integrated stress response pathway. GADD34 is a stress inducible gene that encodes a regulatory subunit that engages protein phosphatase 1 PP1 and targets dephosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation elongation factor eIF2 Connor et al. 2001 Novoa 2001 Novoa et al. 2003 . GADD34 null mice are healthy but a loss of GADD34 increases the level of phosphorylated eIF2 p eIF2 in stressed cells. Furthermore it has been shown that GADD34 null animals are markedly protected from cell death caused by ER stress Jousse et al. 2003 Marciniak et al. 2005 . Therefore role of eIF2 in the pathogenesis of EAE was tested using GADD34 null mice.

GADD34 null mice were generated. The mice have been backcrossed 6 times with C57BL 6 mice. EAE is induced as follows. Mice were given a subcutaneous injection in the flank and tail base of 200 g MOG 35 55 peptide which was emulsified in complete Freund s adjuvant and supplemented with 600 g of . Two injections each of 400 ng of pertussis toxin were given intraperitoneally at 24 and 72 h following the immunization with the MOG 35 55 peptide. Clinical severity scores were recorded daily according to a 0 5 point scale where 0 healthy 1 flaccid tail 2 ataxia and or paresis of hind limbs 3 paralysis of hind limbs and or paresis of forelimbs 4 tetraparalysis and 5 moribund or dead.

The results in show that the onset of the disease is significantly delayed in the GADD34 null mice when compared to the control animals. Therefore inhibition of GADD34 delays the onset of EAE.

Tissue damage in the CNS is determined by immunohistochemistry analysis and toluidine blue staining as described by Lin et al. submitted . Spinal cord tissue is analyzed for tissue damage at the peak of disease severity. An antibody against CC1 APC7 is used as a marker to identify mature oligodendrocytes an antibody against MBP is used to determine the degree of demyelination and an antibody against nonphosphorylated neurofilament H SMI32 is used to detect axonal damage. In addition the severity of demyelination and axonal injury is examined by staining the tissue with toluidine blue. As myelin gene expression is highly correlated with oligodendrocyte function real time PCR is perfomed to determine the steady state levels of mRNAs that encode for MBP PLP and ceramide galactosyltransferase CGT in the spinal cord. The Taqman real time PCR allows for quantifying the degree of demyelination in the lesions.

The results show that progression of EAE is accompanied by a decrease in mRNAs encoding MBP PLP and CGT in both GADD34 null mice and the wild type controls. However the decrease in the GADD34 null mice precedes that seen in the wild type animals.

It is expected that the histological results will be consistent with the time course of the disease as assessed by the phenotypic changes that were quantified using clinical scores and it is likely that loss of function of GADD34 protects from demyelination and from the loss of oligodendrocytes that is characteristic of EAE.

Diverse stressful conditions are associated with phosphorylation of eIF2 . Four mammalian eIF2 kinases have been identified PERK GCN2 RNA activated protein kinase PKR and HRI Proud 2005 . As described in the Examples above the PERK eIF2 pathway is activated in oligodendricytes during EAE by the immune cytokine IFN . Chakrabarty et al. 2004 have shown that activation of the PKR eIF2 pathway occurs in inflammatory cells in the CNS of animals with active EAE.

To confirm that the effect seen in the mice having EAE but lacking GADD34 reflects the protection of oligodendrocytes double immunostaining of CC1 and p eIF2 is performed in the GADD34 null mice and compared to that performed in the wild type control animals.

In addition double immunostaining of CD3 and p eIF2 is performed to determine whether the level of p eIF2 is increased in T cells in the CNS of the GADD34 null mice when compared to the wild type animals. The immune responses in the CNS and peripheral immune system in GADD34 null and littermate control mice are analyzed as described in Lin et al. submitted .

It is expected that the results will indicate that the level of p eIF2 is greater in the oligodendrocytes of the GADD34 null mice than in the wild type mice. Without being bound by any particular theory enhancing the phosphorylation of eIF2 is expected to prolong the integrated stress response and thus oligodendrocytes from the damage caused by EAE.

To evaluate the protective effects seen in oligodendrocytes and gained by the loss of GADD34 deletion experiments that use siRNA to block the expression of GADD34 are performed on purified rat oligodendrocytes in culture. The experimental protocol is described by Lin et al. submitted . Oligodendrocyte progenitors OPCs are cultured from neonatal rat brain as follows. A mixed glial culture is grown in flasks in medium containing 10 FBS and when the astrocyte layer becomes confluent after 10 14 days OPCs are separated from astrocytes and microglia using an orbital shaker. More than 95 of the cells are A2B5 positive GFAP negative and CD11b negative and are first cultured in medium containing 0.5 FBS PDGF 10 ng mL and FGF 5 ng mL then then transferred to 0.5 FBS medium without PDGF and FGF to induce differentiation.

Small interfering RNA siRNA is designed using siRNA Target Finder software Ambion . and used to inhibit the expression of the rat GADD34. The target sequence of the siRNA is used in conjuction with the pSilencer Expression Vectors Insert Design Tool Ambion to generate hairpin siRNA that encodes DNA oligonucleotide inserts that are derived from the siRNA target sequence. The program adds the loop sequence and overhangs that are used for cloning. The hairpin siRNA encoding DNA oligonucleotide inserts are cloned into the pSilencer 4.1 CMV vector Ambion according to the manufacturer s instructions and the pSilencer 4.1 CMV vectors encoding hairpin siRNAs that are specific for GADD34 will be transfected into OPCs using the Nucleofector kit Amaxa according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Control oligodendrocytes are transfected with control vectors that are pSilencer 4.1 CMV vectors that lack GADD34 siRNA. After transfection the cells are selected with 2.5 g mL puromycin over a period of 10 14 days. The transfected OPCs are analyzed for the presence GADD34 mRNA using Taqman real time PCR and for the presence of GADD34 protein using Western blot analysis.

It is expected that the results suggest that siRNA specific for the GADD34 gene successfully inhibits the transcription of GADD34 and the expression of the GADD34 protein.

In addition the protective effect of salubrinol Sal is tested to determine whether Sal protects oligodendrocytes from cytokines oxidants peroxynitrite donors and glutamate. Salubrinol has been shown to specifically inhibit the PP1 GADD34 phosphatase activity which results in sustained eIF2 phosphorylation in stressed cells Boyce et al. 2005 . Sal is combined with TNF HO the peroxynitrite donor SIN 1 and glutamate is added to the cells that have been allowed to differentiate for 7 days. Western blot analysis is used to examine whether Sal elevates the level of p eIF2 in cultured oligodendrocytes. Also the viability of oligodendrocytes is determined by the MTT assay Roche the TUNEL assay ApopTag kit Serologicals and the caspase 3 activity assay Sigma St. Luis Mo. as described by Lin et al. 2001 and 2005.

The results indicate that inhibiting the function of GADD34 by blocking its expression using siRNA technology or by directly inhibiting its enzymic activity protects oligodendrocytes from reactive oxidative nitrative stress and glutamate cytotoxicity. Histologic analyses at the peak of disease will reveal that GADD34 deletion elevates the level of p eIF2 in oligodendrocytes and protects against EAE induced demyelination and oligodendrocyte loss. It is expected that GADD34 siRNA transfection and Sal will protect oligodendrocytes from cytokine exposure reactive oxidative nitrative stress and glutamate excitoxicity. Various aspects of the cytoprotective effects of Sal with those of GADD34 siRNA transfection are compared. The protective effects of Sal in mice with EAE and persons with MS are tested.

The activation of the PERK pathway is initiated by dimerization of PERK which leads to trans autophosphorylation and increased ability to phosphorylate its substrate eIF2 . Normally this dimerization event is driven by the stress sensing ER lumenal domain of PERK Harding 1999 . Other researchers have fused the eIF2 kinase effector domain of PERK to a polypeptide containing 2 modified FK506 binding domains Fv2E to generate a fusion protein Fv2E PERK and have demonstrated that the activity of this artificial eIF2 kinase Fv2E PERK is subordinate to the dimerizer AP20187 and is uncoupled from upstream signaling of ER stress Lu et al. 2004 .

To examine the protective effects of PERK activation on oligodendrocytes in vitro oligodendrocyte precursor cells OPCs are transfected with a construct encoding Fv2E PERK The Fv2E PERK construct is subcloned into the mammalian vector pcDNA3.1 to generate a mammalian expression plasmid that expresses a fusion protein Fv2E PERK protein pcDNA3.1 Fv2E PERK . Purified rat OPCs as described above are transfected with pcDNA3.1 Fv2E PERK using the Nucleofactor kit Amaxa and selected with G418 400 ug ml for 10 14 days.

The OPCs are induced to differentiate for 7 days and the activation of the PERK eIF2 pathway is evaluated in the presence of the dimerizer AP20187 alone or in combination with one of TNF HO peroxynitrite donor SIN 1 or glutamate.

The expression of mRNA encoding Fv2 PERK is verified using real time PCR and the expression of Fv2 PERK protein is verified by Western blot analysis. The effect of the activation of the PERK eIF2 pathway is assessed by Western blot analysis for p eIF2 following addition of AP20187 to the transfected OPCs. Further the viability of transfected oligodendrocytes is determined using the MTT assay TUNEL assay and caspase 3 activity assay as described above following differentiation of OPCs for 7 days. The same analyses are made following administration of AP20187 to the OPCs in the presence of TNF a H2O2 peroxynitrite donor SIN 1 or glutamate. Oligodendrocyte viability is determined by MTT and TUNEL assays and caspase activity.

It is expected that AP20187 will protect the Fv2 PERK expressing oligodendrocytes from effector s of the ER stress pathway.

To determine the mechanisms accounting for the protective effects of activation of the PERK pathway on oligodendrocytes mRNA microarray analysis is used to identify the cytoprotective genes that are upregulated.

OPCs that have been transfected with pcDNA3.1 Fv2E PERK are differentiated for 7 days and treated with AP20187. RNA is isolated from AP20187 treated transfected cells and control transfected cells by using Trizol reagent Invitrogen and DNAseI Invitrogen is added to eliminate genomic DNA. Fluorescent labeled RNA probes are prepared and hybridized to Affimetrix rat high density oligonucleotide arrays. Primary image analysis of the arrays is performed using the Genechip software package Affymetrix . The raw data is also be analyzed by means of GeneSpring software. Only genes whose raw hybridization signal is significantly stronger than that of the chip background is evaluated. The raw signal strength for each gene is normalized to the mean signal strength of all genes from the same chip to obtain the normalized signal strength. To allow visualization of all data on the same scale for subsequent analysis the normalized signal strength of each gene is divided by the median signal strength for that gene among all samples to obtain the expression level.

The results show that cytoprotective genes that are involved in the protective effects of the PERK pathway in EAE are identified. The role of the newly identified genes in the in the pathogenesis of EAE is evaluated.

To provide direct evidence that activation of the PERK eIF2 pathway protects against EAE induced tissue damage through its cytoprotective effects on oligodendrocytes the activity of PERK is modulated in mice that allow for controllable activation of the PERK pathway in oligodendrocytes.

Based on methods previously used to generate transgenic mice that express proteins specifically in oligodendrocytes under the transcriptional control of the regulatory sequences of the myelin proteolipid protein PLP gene Fuss et al. 2000 2001 Doerflinger et al. 2003 an expression construct that expresses the fusion Fv2E PERK PLP Fv2E PERK is engineered and transgene fragments are injected into fertilized C57BL 6 mouse oocytes.

Several lines of PLP Fv2E PERK transgenic mice that express varyious levels of the transgene are obtained and transgene expression is found not to be deleterious to the animals. Quantitative real time PCR is used to determine copy numbers of the transgene that integrates into the genome of heterozygous animals and the level of Fv2E PERK mRNA and protein in the CNS is determined using real time PCR and Western blot analysis The transgenic mice are given intraperitoneal injections of AP20187 and the activity of Fv2E PERK in the CNS is determined by Western blot analysis for p Fv2E PERK and p eIF2 . Finally CC1 and p eIF2 double immunostaining is perfomed to confirm that the eIF2 pathway is specifically activated in oligodendrocytes in the transgenic mice that received AP20187.

The transgenic mice that allow for modest activation of the PERK pathway in oligodendrocytes after administration of AP20187 are selected for EAE experiments. The mice are immunized with MOG33 35 peptide as described in Example and Fv2E PERK in oligodendrocytes is activated by administering AP20187 before the onset of EAE onset. The activation of eIF2 in oligodendrocytes is verified by CC1 and p eIF2 double immunostaining and the clinical phenotype the histopathologic findings in the CNS and the immune response in the CNS are characterized as described in the Examples above.

To determine that the activation of the PERK pathway promotes remyelination of oligodendrocyte in EAE induced demyelinated lesions EAE is induced in PLP Fv2E PER mice and the role of PERK is evaluated in the presence and absence of AP201187.

The PLP Fv2E PERK mice are immunized with MOG33 35 peptide as described in Example and Fv2E PERK is activated in oligodendrocytes by administering AP20187 to the mice during the recovery stage of EAE. Clinical severity scores were recorded daily according to a 0 5 point scale where 0 healthy 1 flaccid tail 2 ataxia and or paresis of hind limbs 3 paralysis of hind limbs and or paresis of forelimbs 4 tetraparalysis and 5 moribund or dead.

The activation of eIF2 in oligodendrocytes is verified by CC1 and p eIF2 double immunostaining. Once the severity of disease between AP20187 treated mice and control mice appears to be significantly different spinal cord tissue is prepared and analyzed for remyelination. As described elsewhere Lin et al. submitted CC1 immunostaining is used to determine the mature oligodendrocyte numbers in the demyelinated lesion and immunostaining for MBP and toluidine blue staining is used to verify the degree of demyelination. The immune response in the CNS is assessed by immunostaining for CD11b and CD3 immunostaining and by real time PCR analyses for INF TNF iNOs IL 2 IL 4 IL 5 IL 10 IL 12 IL 17 and IL 23.

CNS tissue of patients with MS is obtained from the Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center Los Angeles Calif. and The Rocky Mountain MS Center Englewood Colo. . The tissue may include brain and spinal cord tissues spinal fluid and other tissue specimens that are derived from persons who have had MS in their lifetime. The samples are frozen or otherwise preserved very soon after the death of the donors and the banked tissues are carefully catalogued along with information about the donor s medical history and are available to qualified investigators.

Total RNA is isolated from the frozen samples using Trizol reagent Invitrogen and treated with DNAseI Invitrogen to eliminate genomic DNA. Reverse transcription is performed using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for RT PCR kit Invitrogen . Using Taqman real time PCR the expression of INF and the ER stress markers BIP and CHOP is quantified. The protein levels of PERK eIF2 p PERK and p eIF2 are determined using Western blot analysis.

The remaining frozen tissue will be embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound. Frozen sections 10 m thick of the tissue samples are prepared and CC1 immunostaining is used to determine the number of oligodendrocytes in the demyelinated lesions. MBP immunostaining is used to verify the degree of demyelination. The immune response in the CNS is assessed by CD11b immunostaining and CD3 immunostaining. Furthermore CC1 and p PERK double immunostaining or CC1 and p eIF2 double immunostaining is performed to demonstrate the activation of the PERK eIF2 pathway in MS lesions.

On the basis of the distribution and density of inflammatory cells and activated microglia demyelinated MS induced lesions can be divided into the following 3 categories active acute chronic active and chronic inactive Lassmann 1998 Trapp et al. 1999 . The relationship between the levels of INF and the activity of the PERK pathway in the samples and the relationship between the degree of demyelination and the activity of the PERK pathway in the lesions is determined.

It is expected that the PERK eIF2 pathway is activated in the oligodendrocytes of MS lesions. Because of the heterogenous patterns of demyelination in MS the activation of the PERK eIF2 pathway is expected to be detected in only some of the tissue samples.

Phosphorylation of eIF2 is a highly conserved point of convergence among signaling pathways that adapt eukaryotic cells to diverse stressful conditions Jousse et al 2003 163 767 775 Proud CG 2005 16 3 12 . Four protein kinases are known to couple the otherwise unrelated stresses of protein malfolding in the ER PERK amino acid deprivation GCN2 viral infection PKR and heme deficiency HRI to the phosphorylation of eIF2 Proud CG 2005 16 3 12 . This eIF2 phosphorylation dependent stress inducible pathway has been referred to as an integrated stress response ISR Harding et al 2003 11 619 633 Proud CG 2005 16 3 12 . To recover from stress eIF2 is quickly dephosphorylated by a complex containing the enzyme phosphatase PP1 and its essential nonenzymatic cofactor growth arrest and DNA damage 34 GADD34 Connor et al. 2001 21 6841 6850 Novoa et al 2001 153 1011 1022 Novoa et al 2003 22 1180 1187 . The expression of GADD34 is regulated by induction of the cytosolic transcription factor ATF4 the translation of which is upregulated in the presence of eIF2 phosphorylation thus creating a tight auto feedback loop Novoa et al 2003 22 1180 1187 Jiang et al 2004 24 1365 1377 . GADD34 deletion increases the level of p eIF2 in stressed cells and protects cells from stress Jousse et al 2003 163 767 775 Marciniak et al 2004 Genes Dev. 18 3066 3077 .

As shown in the examples above early induction of IFN in the CNS has a protective effect in animals induced to develop EAE and that this protection is dependent on PERK. To test whether the early presence IFN activates the integrated stress response ISR through the activation of PERK in oligodendrocytes and protects them from inflammatory demyelination the effect of EAE was examined in GADD34 mutant mice. It was expected that in the absence of GADD34 the prolonged stress response would be beneficial.

EAE was induced in GADD34 null mice and control animals as described in Example 17. Briefly GADD34 null mice were backcrossed with C57BL 6 mice at least 6 times. EAE was induced in mice by administering to the mice a subcutaneous injection of 200 g MOG 35 55 peptide emulsified in complete Freund s adjuvant supplemented with 600 g of in the flank and tail base. Two 400 ng intraperitoneal injections of pertussis toxin were given 24 and 72 h later. Clinical severity scores were recorded daily using a 0 5 point scale 0 healthy 1 flaccid tail 2 ataxia and or paresis of hind limbs 3 paralysis of hind limbs and or paresis of forelimbs 4 tetraparalysis and 5 moribund or dead .

The clinical disease onset in GADD34 null mice is significantly delayed when compared with the onset in littermate control mice . In addition the severity of disease in the GADD34 null mice was milder than control mice. Therefore loss of GADD34 function delays the onset of EAE and diminishes the severity of the disease.

b. Loss of GADD34 Increases the Level of p eIF2 in Oligodendrocytes and Protects Against EAE Induced Demyelination.

Spinal cord tissue was prepared and analyzed at the time point when control mice were at the peak of disease severity. As expected the expression of GADD34 was upregulated in oligodendrocytes in the lumbar spinal cord of mice with EAE which was undetectable in oligodendrocytes in the age matched na ve mice and . Moreover CC1 and p eIF2 double labeling revealed that GADD34 deletion markedly increased the level of p eIF2 in oligodendrocytes in the lumbar spinal cord of GADD34 null mice with EAE compared with control mice and . Histological analysis revealed typical EAE demyelinating lesions in the lumbar spinal cord of control mice destruction of myelin sheaths and oligodendrocyte loss axonal damage . In contrast no obvious demyelinating lesion was observed in the lumbar spinal cord of GADD34 null mice by MBP immunostaining and toluidine blue staining at this time point and . Importantly oligodendrocytes in the lumbar spinal cord of GADD34 null mice remained almost intact . Moreover GADD34 deletion dramatically reduced the axonal damage in the lumbar spinal cord of GADD34 null mice compared with control mice and . Taken together these data indicate GADD34 deletion increases the level of p eIF2 in oligodendrocytes thus prolongs in the integrated stress response and protects against EAE induced demyelination.

The importance of the phosphorylation of eIF2 in protecting the cell from stress has lead to the search for small molecule modulators of the phosphorylation of eIF2 that could potentially be useful for the treatment of several human diseases. Boyce et al. Boyce et al. 2005 307 935 939 used a drug screen that would identify small molecules that confer cytoprotection against ER stress induced apoptosis. They identified a small molecule inhibitor of eIF2 dephosphorylation salubrinal SAL which specifically inhibits the PP1 GADD34 phosphatase activity resulting in sustained eIF2 phosphorylation. Treatment with Sal protects cells from ER stress and viral infection Boyce et al. 2005 307 935 939 .

Our hypothesis is that the integrated stress response has the potential to protect oligodendrocytes from the harmful effects of the inflammatory response in patients with multiple sclerosis MS . As shown above mice with a null mutation in GADD34 demonstrate increased eIF phosphorylation and a delayed response to EAE induction including less severe demyelinaiton at the peak of disease. To test whether agents that prolong eIF2 phosphorylation might provide protection to oligodendrocytes against detrimental inflammatory factors the effect of Salubrinol Sal in the presence of the immune cytokine IFN was tested in an in vitro model of myelination.

Hippocampal organotypic cultures HOC which have been shown to myelinate well in vitro. HOCs were prepared and maintained as described previously Kunkler and Kraig 1997 17 26 43 and were maintained in vitro for 7 days before use. SAL at various concentrations was combined with 100 U ml INF and added to the HOC cultures for 7 days. Robust myelination was observed in untreated HOCs as demonstrated by abundant levels of the myelin specific protein myelin basic protein MBP in the cultures . After 7 days of 100 U ml IFN exposure the levels of MBP decreased approximately 80 in the HOCs . SAL treatment alone did not affect MBP expression. However SAL treatment markedly attenuated the reduction of MBP expression elicited by IFN exposure . The presence of IFN has been shown to inhibit remyelination in demyelinated lesions See Examples 2 7 . Taken together these data indicate that treatment with agents that promote or prolong eIF2 phosphorlyation could promote myelin repair in immune mediated demyelination diseases.

The transgenic mouse line PLP SOCS1 was generated using a construct containing a PLP expression cassette and SOCS1 cDNA . The PLP expression cassette has been described elsewhere and has been used for oligodendrocyte specific expression of a number of transgenes Wight et al. 1993 Fuss et al. 2000 Doerflinger et al. 2003 Gonzales et al. 2005 . A SOCS1 cDNA clone Starr et al. 1998 was used as it contained a Flag epitope sequence that served as a marker for SOCS1 expression in polymerase chain reaction PCR based or anti Flag antibody based detection methods Einhauer and Jungbauer 2001 . Briefly the Flag SOCS1 cDNA was excised from the original expression vector pEF FLAG I m4A2 with XbaI. The fragment was Klenow filled and subcloned into an intermediate vector modified pNEB 193 vector at the SmaI restriction site. The resulting pNEB193 SOCS1 vector was further digested with AscI partial digestion and PacI to release the Flag SOCS1 fragment which was subcloned into the polylinker region of the PLP expression cassette at the same restriction sites. The PLP SOCS1 vector was digested with ApaI and SacII partial digestion and a linear 15 kb transgene was isolated for microinjection into fertilized C57BL 6J DBA 2J oocytes. Offspring positive for the transgene were identified by amplifying tail DNA by PCR using transgene specific primers. The identified founders were subsequently bred with C57BL 6J mice Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor Me. establishing a transgenic line.

The transgenic mice MBP IFN line 172 and GFAP tTA TRE INF lines 184 110 and 184 67 that overexpress INF in the CNS have been described elsewhere Corbin et al. 1996 Gao et al. 2000 Lin et al. 2004 2005 . Briefly MBP IFN line 172 mice are transgenic animals in which INF expression is driven by the myelin basic protein MBP transcriptional control region Gao et al. 2000 . GFAP tTA TRE IFN are double transgenic mice obtained by mating single transgenic GFAP tTA line 184 to single transgenic TRE IFN lines 110 and 67 mice. The two TRE IFN mouse lines line 110 and line 67 used in the experiments produce different amounts of INF when crossed to GFAP tTA mice 184 110 and 184 67 Line al. 2004 2005 . GFAP tTA TRE IFN is a tetracycline off inducible system in which the glial fibrilary acidic protein GFAP transcriptional control region drives the expression of tTA which in turn binds to the TRE tet responsive element and initiates the expression of IFN . Administration of doxycycline suppresses tTA DNA binding and IFN expression and doxycycline removal allows for temporally controlled induction of IFN expression Gao et al. 1999 .

IFN overexpressing mice were crossed to the PLP SOCS1 mice in double transgenic MBP INF PLP SOCS1 and triple transgenic GFAP tTA TRE INF PLP SOCS1 mating systems. MBP INF PLP SOCS1 172 PLP SOCS1 mating was performed according to a standard mating protocol. The GFAP tTA TRE INF PLP SOCS1 matings were performed in a 2 step mating process GFAP tTA mice line 184 were initially crossed to PLP SOCS1 mice and double positive 184 PLP SOCS1 offspring were then crossed to the TRE INF lines 110 and 67 separately. This second mating step was performed according to the previously described tet off protocol. Doxycycline 0.05 mg ml Sigma Aldich was added to the water of impregnated female mice until embryonic day 14 after which the animals were switched back to normal water thereby allowing initiation of IFN transcription which peaks during the postnatal period Lin et al. 2005 .

The litters of the mating systems F1 generation were examined daily and sacrificed at postnatal day 21. Clinical evaluation included behavioral observation and challenged ladder walking to elicit tremor. Histological examination included quantitation of the number and density of oligodendrocytes and examination of the myelination patterns. Brain tissue was simultaneously obtained from each animal at the time of sacrifice to verify and measure the expression of IFN and Flag SOCS1 see below . The clinical and histological findings were subsequently stratified according to genotype. All animal procedures were conducted in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at The University of Chicago.

All experimental animals were genotyped using isolated tail DNA Biotek 2000 automatic system Beckman Coutler Fullerton Calif. . PCR Qiagen PCR kit Valencia Calif. for transgene detection was performed using the following transgene specific screening primers Flag SOCS1 sense primer 5 CCAGGACGACGATGACAAGA 3 SEQ ID NO 41 and Flag SOCS1 anti sense primer 5 TCAGGGGTCCCCAATAGAAG 3 SEQ ID NO 42 MBP IFN sense primer 5 ATGAGGAAGAGCTGCAAAGC 3 SEQ ID NO 43 and MBP IFN anti sense primer 5 GGTGACAGACTCCAAGCACA 3 SEQ ID NO 44 GFAP tTA sense primer 5 TCGCTTTCCTCTGAACGCTTCTCG 3 SEQ ID NO 45 and GFAP tTA anti sense primer 5 TCTGAACGCTGTGACTTGGAGTGTCC 3 SEQ ID NO 46 TRE IFN sense primer 5 CGAATTCGAGCTCGG TACCC 3 SEQ ID NO 47 and TRE WN anti sense primer 5 CCATCCTTTGCCATTCCTCCAG 3 SEQ ID NO 48 Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. .

Total RNA was isolated from the examined animals with TRIzol reagent Invitrogen Corp. Carlsbad Calif. . Northern blots were performed by separating 20 g of total RNA in a 1.2 denaturing agarose gel. The samples were transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized overnight with a SOCS1 probe that had been randomly labeled by PCR GenAmp2400 Perkin Elmer Welleslay Mass. with P dCTP and P dATP New England Nuclear Perkin Elmer Welleslay Mass. . Kodak film was exposed to the hybridized membrane at 80 C. for 48 hrs and was developed using the M7B Kodak processor Kodak Rochester N.Y. . To evaluate the relative levels of total RNA present in each lane the membrane was stripped and hybridized with a radiolabeled probe specific for the 28S ribosomal RNA Baerwald et al. 1998 .

Quantitative Q PCR or real time PCR was performed by first reverse transcribing 1 g of DNAaseI treated Invitrogen total RNA using oligo dT and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase Invitrogen RT PCR kit . Q PCR was performed using 20 ng of the cDNA in a reaction containing iQSupermix and the following primers and probes for Flag SOCS1 and IFN . Flag SOCS1 sense primer 5 GATGACAAGACGCGCCAG ATG 3 SEQ ID NO 49 Flag SOCS1 anti sense primer 5 GAGGACGAGGAGGGCTCTGA 3 SEQ ID NO 50 and Flag SOCS1 probe 5 56FAM CGCACCCAGCTGGCAGCCGACATT 3BHQ 1 3 SEQ ID NO 51 IIFN sense primer 5 GATATCTCGAGGAACTGGCAAAA 3 SEQ ID NO 52 IFN anti sense primer 5 CTACAAAGAGTCTGAGGTAGAAAGAGATAAT 3 SEQ ID NO 53 and IIFN probe 5 FAM TGGTGACATGAAAATCCTGCAGAGCCA BHQ1 3 SEQ ID NO 54 GAPDH sense primer 5 CTCAACTACATGGTCTACATGTTCCA 3 SEQ ID NO 55 GAPDH anti sense primer 5 CCATTCTCGGCCTTGACTGT 3 SEQ ID NO 56 and GAPDH probe 5 5TxRd XN TGACTCCACTCACGGCAAATTCAACG 3BHQ 2 3 SEQ ID NO 57 Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. . The reactions were performed using a BioRad I cycler Real Time PCR unit under the following conditions 1 cycle at 95 C. for 3 min 40 cycles at 95 C. for 30 s and 60 C. for 30 s Bio Rad Laboratories . The mRNA levels of Flag SOCS1 and IFN were normalized to the expression levels of GAPDH based on threshold cycles Flag SOCS1 GAPDH and IFN GAPDH ratios Lin et al. 2005 .

Total lysates from brain and spleen of several PLP SOCS1 mice and wild type mice were obtained by tissue homogenization in RIPA buffer Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz Calif. . After incubation on ice for 15 min lysates were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 30 min and the supernatants collected. Protein samples 50 g were electrophoresed on 15 SDS polyacrylamide gels transferred to PVDF membranes Trans blot SD apparatus Bio Rad Laboratories incubated overnight with mouse anti Flag antibody M2 diluted to 1 1000 Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. and detected with ECL Western blot detection reagents Amersham Biosciences Piscataway N.J. . Flag protein Sigma Aldrich a polymer of the Flag oligopeptide was used as a positive control for the reaction.

Immunoprecipitation was performed with an immunoprecipitation kit Roche Molecular Biochemicals Indianapolis Ind. by incubating the protein extracts from the brain and spleen of PLP SOCS1 and wild type mice with anti Flag antibody M2 for 4 hrs at 4 C. followed by overnight incubation with protein A C agarose at 4 C. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 20S and the protein was separated from protein A C agarose with kit supplied reagents. Western blot of the immunoprecipitated protein was performed as described above.

Animals were anesthetized with 0.01 ml g of 2.5 Avertin Sigma Aldrich administered intraperitoneally and perfused with saline followed by 2 paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Brains were removed postfixed for 1 hr with 2 paraformaldehyde cryopreserved with 30 sucrose for 48 h prepared as frozen blocks OCT compound Sacura Torrance Calif. and sectioned at a thickness of 7 m at 20 C. Leica CM1800 cryostat Leica Microsystems . Prior to immunostaining the sections were treated with 0.1 Triton X 100 Sigma Aldrich for 10 min and incubated with 10 bovine serum albumin Sigma Aldrich or goat serum Invitrogen for 30 min. Indirect immunostaining was performed by sequential incubation with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 C. and FITC conjugated or Cy3 congugated secondary antibodies for 30 min . All of the following primary and secondary antibodies used in the study were commercially available mouse and rabbit anti Flag antibody dilution 1 100 Sigma Aldrich mouse anti CC1 antibody dilution 1 20 Oncogene mouse MHC class I antibody dilution 1 100 Chemicon International Temecula Calif. mouse anti PLP proteolipid protein antibody dilution 1 100 Chemicon International mouse and rabbit anti SOCS1 antibody dilution 1 100 Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz Calif. rabbit anti Stat1 antibody dilution 1 100 Santa Cruz Biotecnology anti mouse or anti rabbit FITC conjugated secondary antibody dilution 1 100 Jackson Immunoresearch Bar Harbor Me. and anti mouse or anti rabbit Cy3 congugated antibody dilution 1 500 Jackson Immunoresearch . The immunostained sections were mounted using Vectorshield mounting medium containing DAPI nuclear stain Vector Laboratories Burlingame Calif. and examined using a fluorescent microscope Axoplan Carl Zeiss Microimaging .

Oligodendrocyte cell density was assessed digitally using Axiovision software at postnatal day 21 as previously described Lin et al. 2005 . The brains were sectioned sagittally through the corpus callosum dividing the brain in two symmetrical halves. Ten frozen sections from each half were prepared at 7 m thickness and numbered in the sequence of their preparation. The brains of three animals per study group were prepared in this fashion. Following the CC1 immunostaining the corresponding area of corpus callosum of each section was digitally selected and the corresponding total area obtained. CC1 cell counting was performed manually within the selected areas of each section and the number of CC1 positive cells per square area mm calculated. The results were presented as mean SD of CC1 cells mmwith n 3 animals per study group.

Mice selected for electron microscopy studies were perfused with 4 paraformaladehyde and 2.5 glutaraldehyde. Brains were harvested and white matter structures were sectioned using a stereotype microscope Wild M3C Wild AG Heebrugg Switzerland . The tissue was further postfixed in osmium tetroxide and embedded in freshly prepared Epoxy resin Epon 812 Electron Microscope Sciences Fort Washington Pa. for 48 hrs at 60 C. The resin blocks were sectioned at 90 nm using Leica Ultracut ultramicrotome Leica Microsystems and stained with 5 uracyl acetate and 2.5 lead citrate. Utrastructure of the tissue samples was examined using the Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope FEI Company Hillsboro Oreg. .

Myelination patterns of the examined animals were assessed at postnatal day 21 by calculating the percent unmyelinated axons and ratio of the axon fiber diameters G ratio with Image J software National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. as previously described Lin at al. 2005 . The brains were sectioned sagittally through the corpus callosum dividing the brain in two symmetrical halves. Approximately 2 mmsamples from the genu and the splenum of both halves of corpus callosum were obtained using a Wild M3C stereotype microscope. The orientation of the specimen in the resin blocks yielding axonal cross sections well seen myelin rings was chosen and established by toluedine blue staining of a few sample sections. The resin blocks with the chosen orientation were processed for electron microscope examination. Randomly selected areas were examined and ten representative pictures from both genu and splenum corpus callosum were obtained at 12000 magnification. The number of unmyelinated axons was assessed by manual counting of axons that lacked myelin and were encircled solely by their own plasma membrane. All unmyelinated axons present in the representative images were counted and their percentage calculated by examining a total of five hundred axons per tissue sample. The G ratio axonal diameter fiber diameter ratio of myelinated axons was assessed by digitally selecting the area encircled by the inner and outer surfaces of the myelin sheath obtaining the axonal inner and the fiber outer diameters and dividing their corresponding values axonal diameter fiber diameter ratio . The brains of three animals per group were examined and the G ratios of a total of 150 nerve fibers from both genu and splenum were examined. The results were presented as mean SD of G ratio and percent unmyelinataed axons with n 3 animals per study group.

Mixed primary oligodendrocyte cultures were prepared as previously described Baerwald et al. 2000 . Briefly brain tissue was harvested from 2 3 day old newborn pups of PLP SOCS1 and C57B1 6J matings. Because the litters contained transgenic and wild type pups the brain of each animal was processed individually cultured separately and later genotype matched. Each brain was digested separately using 0.25 trypsin and 10 g ml of DNAaseI Invitrogen in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM for 20 min at 37 C. and cells were cultured on separate poly D lysine coated 75 mmflasks Sigma Aldrich . The cultures were maintained with 10 fetal bovine serum DMEM at 37 C. with 5 COfor 12 days and then switched to a defined medium containing 5 l ml of insulin 50 g ml of transferrin 30 nM of selenium 10 nM of biotin 10 nM of progesterone 15 nM of T3 0.1 bovine serum albumin and 1 ampicillin streptomycin Sigma Aldrich . On the fifth day of differentiation the cultures were treated with 100 U mL of IFN Calbiochem San Diego Calif. for 30 min. Dual immunostaining for anti PLP and anti Stat1 antibodies and DAPI nuclear staining were performed as described above. The Stat1 nuclear translocation assay was performed in six separate culture preparations. One hundred PLP positive cells were manually counted in both wild type and PLP SOCS1 cultures. The results were presented as mean SD percent cells positive for Stat1 nuclear translocation.

All data were generated from three independent experiments. Means standard deviations and p values were calculated using Average Stdev and Anova in Microsoft Excel Microsoft Redmond Wash. . A statistically significant difference was defined as a p value of 

The PLP SOCS1 transgenic mice which were generated as described in Example 25 were designed to express Flag epitope tagged SOCS1 in myelinating cells . These mice exhibit no phenotypic abnormalities breed and produce transgenic progeny in a Mendelian fashion and live a normal life span. Histological evaluation including electron microscopy performed at different time points up to 1 year of age revealed no significant differences in the myelination patterns or the number density or morphology of oligodendrocytes see below between transgenic and wild type littermates.

Expression of the PLP SOCS1 transgene was characterizedc at postnatal day 21 using several methods. Northern blot analysis with a SOCS1 cDNA hybridization probe revealed a band of increased intensity in RNA samples from the brains of transgenic mice relative to control brain samples but not from other tissues . Real time PCR analysis with transgene specific primers revealed the highest concentrations of transgene derived SOCS1 mRNA in brain spinal cord and sciatic nerve with significantly lower levels in other organs including heart thymus spleen and liver . Transgene expression appeared to be stable up to 12 months of age data not shown .

Western blot analysis using an antibody to the Flag tag revealed a 19 kD band corresponding to the expected size of SOCS1 in the PLP SOCS1 brain lysates but not in wild type brain lysates or PLP SOCS1 spleen lysates . To further confirm Flag SOCS1 protein expression we performed immunoprecipitation with the anti Flag antibody which again detected a 19 kD positive band in the PLP SOCS1 brain immunoprecipitates but not in the wild type brain or PLP SOCS1 spleen immunoprecipitates .

Indirect immunostaining of wild type and PLP SOCS1 brains with both anti SOCS1 and anti Flag antibodies also demonstrated expression of the transgene . We detected both anti Flag and anti SOCS1 immunopositivity only in PLP SOCS1 brains.

To localize the expression of Flag SOCS1 in the CNS we performed dual immunostaining of wild type and PLP SOCS1 brain tissue with the anti Flag antibody and either anti PLP antibody a marker for myelin or anti CC1 antibody a marker for the oligodendrocyte cell body. A strong colocalization between anti PLP and anti Flag antibodies as well as between anti CC1 and anti Flag antibodies data not shown was found suggesting that Flag SOCS1 was localized to the white matter and oligodendrocytes . Non colocalizing immunopositivity for anti Flag anti PLP or anti CC1 antibodies was not detected.

The expression of Flag SOCS1 in primary mixed oligodendrocyte cultures established from transgenic animals by dual immunostaining with anti PLP and anti Flag antibodies was also detected . Expression of Flag SOCS1 was detected only in cultures from PLP SOCS1 animals and only in cells expressing PLP. Virtually all PLP positive cells were also positive for Flag SOCS1. The colocalization between anti Flag and anti PLP immunoreactivity appeared to involve both the cell body and cell processes .

The responsiveness of PLP SOCS1 oligodendrocytes to INF was studied in primary mixed glial cultures. To determine whether expression of transgenic SOCS1 would interfere with the nuclear translocation of the IFN signaling molecule Stat1 the cell cultures were treated with 100 U mL of IFN for 30 min and immunostained using anti PLP and anti Stat1 antibodies along with the DAPI nuclear stain . Examination of Stat1 subcellular localization in wild type cultures revealed strong colocalization with DAPI positive nuclei in all cells including PLP positive oligodendrocytes. In contrast subcellular localization of Stat1 in PLP SOCS1 cultures revealed a differential response to IFN . In transgenic PLP positive oligodendrocytes Stat1 remained in the cytoplasm and did not colocalize with cell nuclei in the presence of IFN . This was in contrast to the response of the surrounding PLP negative cells which similarly to wild type cells responded to IFN with Stat1 nuclear translocation. Virtually all PLP positive oligodendrocytes 96 3 cells in the wild type cultures responded to INF stimulation with Stat1 nuclear translocation. In contrast Stat1 nuclear translocation was detected only in occasional PLP positive oligodendrocytes 6 2 cells following IFN stimulation p

We next characterized the responsiveness of PLP SOCS1 oligodendrocytes to INF in vivo using the induction of major histocompatibilty complex class I MHC class I molecule expression as an indication of IFN sensitivity. The capacity of SOCS1 to inhibit IFN mediated induction of MHC class I molecule was examined in a double transgenic system. MBP IFN line 172 single transgenic mice which express a low level of INF in the CNS Gao et al. 2000 were mated to PLP SOCS1 mice and the single and double transgenic progeny were examined for differences in MHC class I molecule expression . MHC class I molecule expression was neither detectable in control wild type mice nor PLP SOCS1 mice . Consistent with previous reports MBP INF mice exhibited upregulated expression of the MHC class I molecule with diffuse protein localization along the myelin sheath F Corbin et al. 1996 . The double transgenic mice MBP IFN PLP SOCS1 however displayed a differential pattern of MHC class I molecule expression . As shown in oligodendrocytes and myelin positive for Flag tagged SOCS1 did not express detectable levels of MHC class I molecule whereas cells negative for transgene expression and in close proximity to the SOCS1 positive cells demonstrated strong immunoreactivity . Similar differential upregulation of MHC class I molecule expression was observed following the direct administration of INF in the brain of PLP SOCS1 mice data not shown . Together these data indicate that oligodendrocytes from PLP SOCS1 mice display diminished responsiveness to IFN .

Transgenic expression of IFN in the CNS of developing mice results in oligodendrocyte loss and hypomyelination Corbin et al. 1996 Lin et al 2005 . To determine whether SOCS1 expression could protect developing oligodendrocytes from the injurious effects of IFN we crossed PLP SOCS1 mice to three transgenic mouse lines overexpressing INF in the CNS at different levels MBP IFN line 172 GFAP tTA TRE IFN lines 184 110 and GFAP tTA TRE IFN lines 184 67 and the following three mating systems were established detailed in the Material and Methods MBP IFN PLP SOCS1 172 PLP SOCS1 a double transgenic system and GFAP tTA TRE INF PLP SOCS1 184 110 PLP SOCS1 and 184 67 PLP SOCS1 two triple transgenic systems . The litter F1 generation of each mating system was divided into four study groups depending on their genotype wild type single transgenic controls mice expressing SOCS1 only mice expressing IFN only and mice expressing both IFN and SOCS1. A total of 40 animals per mating system 10 animals per each study group were collected and examined clinically and histologically at postnatal day 21.

Phenotypic comparisons of littermates were performed from birth to postnatal day 21 and evaluation consisted of behavioral observation and challenged ladder walking to elicit tremor. MBP INF line 172 mice express low levels of IFN in the CNS and displayed no behavioral abnormalities in accordance with findings reported elsewhere Corbin et al. 1996 . Mice from the F1 generation of the MBP IFN PLP SOCS1 172 PLP SOCS1 mating system similarly displayed no behavioral abnormalities regardless of genotype. Double transgenic GFAP tTA TRE IFN lines 184 110 and GFAP tTA TRE IFN lines 184 67 mice display mild to moderate tremor that appears during the second postnatal week and peaks by 21 days of age Lin et al. 2004 2005 . Mice from the F1 generation of the GFAP tTA TRE IFN PLP SOCS1 mating systems exhibited tremor the incidence of which was dependent on genotype Table 2 .

Littermates from three transgenic mating systems 172 PLP SOCS1 184 110 PLP SOCS1 and 184 67 PLP SOCS1 were stratified according to their genotype into four groups Wild type control mice mice expressing SOCS1 only mice expressing INF only and mice expressing both INF and SOCS1. Ten mice per group were clinically followed during the first three postnatal weeks and the incidence of tremor recorded.

The phenotypes of wild type mice and single transgenic control mice GFAP tTA 184 TRE IFN 67 and 110 and PLP SOCS1 mice were clinically normal. The tremoring phenotype which varied in severity was identified in almost all double transgenic GFAP tTA TRE IFN mice overexpressing IFN . 80 8 10 of 184 110 mice and 100 10 10 of 184 67 mice. Triple transgenic GFAP tTA TRE IFN PLP SOCS1 mice overexpressing both IFN and SOCS1 appeared to be protected because only 10 1 10 of 184 110 PLP SOCS1 mice and 30 3 10 of 184 67 PLP SOCS1 mice developed tremor Table 2 .

The clinically examined littermates of all three transgenic mating systems were further evaluated for histological abnormalities at postnatal day 21. Three animals per study group from each mating system were examined histologically for oligodendrocyte and myelin abnormalities. Brain tissue was obtained from each animal at the time of sacrifice prior to the fixating perfusion and total RNA isolated. The possibility that SOCS1 expression affected the expression of the INF transgene was examined in all three transgenic mating systems using quantitative PCR Q PCR . IFN expression was detected in MBP IFN single transgenic and MBP IFN PLP SOCS1 double transgenic littermates of the 172 PLP SOCS1 transgenic system in GFAP tTA TRE IFN double transgenic and GFAP tTA TRE IFN PLP SOCS1 triple transgenic littermates of the 184 110 PLP SOCS1 transgenic system and in GFAP tTA TRE IFN double transgenic and GFAP tTA TRE IFN PLP SOCS1 triple transgenic littermates of the 184 67 PLP SOC1 transgenic system. Two characteristics of INF expression were observed. First the three mating systems differed in their expression levels MBP INF PLP SOCS1 172 PLP SOCS1 expressed the lowest and GFAP tTA TRE IFN PLP SOCS1 184 67 PLP SOC1 expressed the highest INF levels. Secondly the littermates of the same mating system expressing INF only or both INF and SOCS1 did not differ in their expression levels. No detectible levels of INF were found in the wild type the GFAP tTA and TRE IFN single transgenic and the PLP SOCS1 littermates .

The cerebra of three animals per study group from all transgenic mating systems were processed for immunohistochemical analysis with the CC1 antibody to determine oligodendrocyte density and . The MBP IFN mice expressed the lowest levels of IFN in the CNS compared to GFAP tTA TRE IFN mice and displayed no significant abnormalities in CC1 positive cell density in accordance with results reported previously Gao et al. 2000 . We found no statistically significant difference in the oligodendrocyte density among mice from the F1 generation of the MBP IFN PLP SOCS1 172 PLP SOCS1 mating system. In the triple transgenic systems GFAP tTA TRE IFN PLP SOCS1 we found that the oligodendrocyte density in mice from the F1 generation differed depending on genotype and . Wild type mice and the single transgenic mice PLP SOCS1 GFAP tTA and TRE IFN had comparable oligodendrocyte densities. We found severe dose dependent oligodendocyte loss in the GFAP tTA TRE IFN mice overexpressing IFN compared with the wild type and single transgenic littermates approximately 20 of oligodendrocytes were lost in 184 110 mice from 146 6 CC1 cells mmin the wild type mice to 115 8 CC1 cells mmin the IFN mice and approximately 40 were lost in 184 67 mice from 144 5 CC1 cells mmin the wild type mice to 79 9 CC1 cells mmin the INF overexpressing mice . In contrast GFAP tTA TRE INF PLP SOCS1 triple transgenic littermates that overexpressed both IFN and SOCS1 lost statistically significantly fewer oligodendrocytes compared with mice overexpressing INF only approximately 8 of oligodendrocytes were lost in 184 110 PLP SOCS1 mice from 141 6 CC1 cells mmin the PLP SOCS1 mice to 129 6 CC1 cells mmin the IFN and SOCS1 overexpressing mice and approximately 15 were lost in 184 67 PLP SOCS1 mice from 142 5 CC1 cells mmin the PLP SOCS1 mice to 112 7 CC1 cells mmin the IFN and SOCS1 overexpressing mice and .

Myelination patterns in the harvested cerebra were further evaluated with electron microscopy and the level of myelination was assessed by calculating the G ratio axon diameter fiber diameter ratio and the percentage of unmyelinating axons and D and . We found no statistically significant difference in G ratios among wild type the single transgenic and double transgenic littermates from the MBP IFN PLP SOCS1 172 PLP SOCS1 mating system. In the triple transgenic systems GFAP tTA TRE IFN PLP SOCS1 significant differences in G ratios were found among the F1 generation mice depending on genotype and . G ratios among the wild type and the GFAP tTA TRE IFN and PLP SOCS1 single transgenic littermates were similar. IFN overexpressing GFAP tTA TRE IFN littermates displayed significantly increased G ratios indicating hypomyelination defined as a G ratio 0.8 0.89 0.02 for 184 110 mice and 0.95 0.04 for the 184 67 mice . In contrast their triple transgenic GFAP tTA TRE IFN PLP SOCS1 littermates overexpressing both IFN and SOCS1 had significantly lower G ratios 0.75 0.03 within the normal range for 184 110 PLP SOCS1 mice and 0.82 0.08 for 184 67 PLP SOCS1 mice and .

The myelin abnormalities were further quantified by determining the percentage of unmyelinated axons in the various transgenic genotypes . We found no significant difference in the percentage of unmyelinated axons less than 9 among the F1 generation littermates of the MBP IFN PLP SOCS1 172 PLP SOCS1 double transgenic system regardless of genotype . In the triple transgenic GFAP tTA TRE IFN PLP SOCS1 systems however the distribution of unmyelinated axons differed depending on genotype . There was a significantly increased percentage of unmyelinated axons in IFN overexpressing GFAP tTA TRE IFN littermates compared to wild type and single transgenic control mice 41 6 in 184 110 mice and 57 7 in 184 67 mice. In contrast triple transgenic GFAP tTA TRE INF PLP SOCS1 overexpressing both INF and SOCS1 had a significantly lower percentage of unmyelinated axons compared with mice overexpressing INF alone only 13 3 for 184 110 PLP SOCS1 mice and 17 4.5 for 184 67 PLP SOCS1 mice . Together these data demonstrate that oligodendroglial expression of SOCS1 protects mice from the clinical and morphological consequences of IFN expression in the CNS during development.

The presence of the T cell derived cytokine IFN within the CNS is believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of immune mediated demyelinating disorders Panitch et al 1987 Galbinski et al. 1999 Tran et al. 2000 Vartanian et al. 1996 Horwitz et al. 1997 Steinman 2001 . Nevertheless the cellular target of the cytokine s effect remains unresolved. In this report we describe the generation of transgenic mice in which the oligodendrocytes display a significantly reduced capacity to respond to IFN . These mice are protected from the injurious effect of ectopic expression of INF within the CNS suggesting that a direct deleterious effect of IFN on oligodendrocytes contributes to immune mediated disease pathogenesis. As discussed below the work described has significant clinical implications.

Transgenic animals that ectopically express INF in the CNS during postnatal development are hypomyelinated and contain reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes Corbin et al. 1996 LeFerla et al. 2000 Lin et al. 2005 . Moreover the induction of INF expression in the CNS following demyelinating insults results in reduced oligodendroglial repopulation of the demyelinating lesions and impaired remyelination Lin et al. in press . Previously reported data from our laboratory suggests that the presence of INF in the CNS activates an ER stress response in oligodendrocytes which contributes to the observed pathological effects Lin et al 2005 in press . It is unclear however if the injurious effect of INF on oligdodendrocytes is a result of a direct action or whether it represents a secondary effect possibly through microglial activation.

INF has also been shown to have harmful effects on oligodendrocytes and their progenitors in vitro. There is considerable evidence to suggest that at least part of the injurious effect of this cytokine is mediated through the activation of microglial cells. IFN treated microglia release cytotoxic agents including nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor alpha which are known to be damaging to oligodendrocytes Merrill et al. 1991 1993 Loughlin et al. 1997 . Studies using purified oligodendrocytes in vitro however suggest that the cytokine may have a direct harmful effect on oligodendrocytes Torres et al. 1995 Agresti et al. 1996 Baerwald et al. 1998 Andrews et al. 1998 Lin et al. 2005 . IFN has been shown to inhibit cell cycle exit of oligodendroglial progenitor cells which may predispose these cells to apoptotic death Chew et al. 2005 . Additionally INF has been shown to be a very powerful apoptosis inducing agent for developing oligodendrocytes Baerwald et al. 1998 2000 Lin et al. 2005 . Oligodendrocytes that have been allowed to differentiate in vitro to the point of expressing mature oligodendroglial markers are less sensitive to the presence of the cytokine although they do eventually succumb to necrosis Baerwald et al. 1998 .

In an effort to differentiate direct versus indirect effects of INF on oligodendrocytes in vivo we generated transgenic mice that exhibited diminished oligodendrocyte specific responsiveness to IFN . Transgenic mice expressing either the dominant negative form of IFN receptor subunit 1 IFNGR1 or the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 SOCS1 have been previously described Flodstrom et al. 2001 Gonzales at al. 2005 Hindinger et al. 2005 . Overexpression of the dominant negative form of IFNGR1 resulted in accelerated degradation of wild type IFNGR1 and elimination of the INF cellular binding sites Dighe et al. 1994 . SOCS1 is an intracellular protein that blocks INF mediated Stat1 activation i.e. phosphorylation by Jak kinases Starr et al. 1997 Song and Shuai 1998 Sakamoto et al. 2000 Yasukawa et al. 2000 Kubo et al. 2003 Stark et al. 1998 Levy and Darnell 2002 . Mouse mutants with a targeted null mutation in the SOCS1 gene exhibit abnormal hypersensitivity to INF and die of multi organ failure in the presence of normal levels of the cytokine Starr et al. 1998 Alexander et al. 1999 Bullen et al. 2001 . Moreover forced expression of SOCS1 has been shown to result in a state of IFN unresponsiveness in a variety of cell types Tunley et al. 2001 2002 Chong et al. 2001 Federici et al. 2002 Flodstom et al. 2001 .

The PLP SOCS1 mice exhibited no phenotypic or histological abnormalities indicating that Stat1 activation is not required for normal oligodendrocyte development even though its involvement in growth factor signaling has been suggested in vitro Dell Albani et al. 1998 . Our finding is supported by the phenotypic characteristics of Stat1 knockout mice which displayed no oligodendrocyte or myelin abnormalities but do have significantly impaired IFN cellular responses Meraz et al. 1996 . Thus it appears that Stat1 activation plays a differential role in oligodendorocyte injury and development.

Functional examination of the PLP SOCS1 mice further demonstrated a diminished oligodendrocyte specific responsiveness to IFN including inhibition of Stat1 activation i.e. phosphorylation and nuclear translocation and MHC class I molecule upregulation. When crossed with transgenic mice overexpressing IFN in the CNS PLP SOCS1 mice were protected from the deleterious clinical and histological effects of IFN . IFN overexpressing transgenic mice that also carried the PLP SOCS1 transgene displayed significant oligodendrocyte and myelin preservation and lower prevalence of tremor compared to IFN expressing mice without the PLP SOCS1 transgene. Results of our study thereby indicate that IFN exerts a direct injurious effect on developing oligodendrocytes.

Overexpression of SOCS1 provided cellular protection to oligodendrocytes suggesting that inhibition of INF signaling results in reduced cellular effects. Wild type oligodendrocytes as reported by others and also observed by us express nearly undetectable amounts of SOCS1 under normal and even inflammatory conditions and have much lower SOCS1 expression compared to the surrounding glial and inflammatory cells Polizzotto et al. 2000 Wang and Campbell 2002 Maier et al. 2002 . Such low constitutive expression may limit the oligodendrocyte capacity for effective downregulation of IFN Jak Stat1 signaling resulting in enhanced IFN cellular effects. The rescuing effect of SOCS1 overexpression in oligodendrocytes that was observed in our experimental system supports this possibility.

Circumstantial and experimental evidence suggests that IFN plays a deleterious role in the immune mediated demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis Popko et al. 1997 Steinman 2001 . INF is found in demyelinated lesions and its levels in cerebrospinal fluid correlate with disease severity Vartanian et al. 1996 Calabresi et al. 1998 Becher et al. 1999 Moldovan et al. 2003 . Administration of IFN to MS patients exacerbated the disease and neutralizing antibodies to IFN have been shown to delay disease progression Panitch et al 1987 Skurkovich et al. 2001 . Diminishing the local effect of IFN perhaps through the targeted expression of SOCS1 by oligodendrocytes can be therapeutically beneficial. Remyelinating oligodendrocytes after a demyelinating insult are more sensitive to the presence of INF Lin et al. in press therefore such protection might be particularly useful for the promotion of remyelination.

Stem cell therapy is rapidly gaining interest as a potential therapeutic approach to demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis and adrenoleukodystrophy review in Keirstead 2005 . Stem cells engineered to be resistant to the harmful cytokines present in the extracellular milieu of the breached CNS is expected to stand a better chance of surviving and accomplishing remyelination. It is therefore of therapeutic interest to identify signaling pathways that play differential roles in oligodendrocyte injury and development. Our results describing inhibition of IFN mediated oligodendrocyte injury without induction of any observable oligodendrocyte or myelin abnormalities provide support for such an approach.

In summary we have demonstrated that the forced expression of SOCS1 in oligodendrocytes of transgenic mice protects against the deleterious effects of IFN on oligodendrocytes and the process of myelination. Our results strongly indicate that the deleterious effect of IFN on myelinating oligodendrocytes is due at least in part to a direct adverse effect on these cells. Moreover our work suggests that forced expression of SOCS1 in oligodendrocytes can provide protection against the harsh environment in immune mediated demyelinating disorders.
