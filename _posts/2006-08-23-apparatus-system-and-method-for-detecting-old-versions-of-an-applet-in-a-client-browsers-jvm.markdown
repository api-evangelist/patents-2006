title: Apparatus, system and method for detecting old versions of an applet in a client browser's JVM
abstract: An apparatus, system and method for checking the version of a cached applet on a client device against version information stored on a host server is provided. By checking the version of the applet, it can be determined whether or not the applet is still usable with the host server. If an applet is not usable with the host server, the applet is either automatically updated to a current version or the user is provided with information as to how to update the applet to the current version. If an applet is usable with the host server but is not a current version of the applet, the user may be informed of this fact and given the opportunity to either update the applet or continue to execute the older version of the applet. If the user chooses to update the applet, the update is performed in substantially the same manner as that described above. If the user chose to continue with the older version of the applet, the mainline code of the older version of the applet is executed.
