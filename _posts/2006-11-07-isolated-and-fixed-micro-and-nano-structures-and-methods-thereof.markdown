Generally the present disclosure relates to micro and nanoscale particles and methods for forming the particles.

The availability of viable nanofabrication processes is a key factor to realizing the potential of nanotechnologies. In particular the availability of viable nanofabrication processes is important to the fields of photonics electronics and proteomics. Traditional imprint lithographic IL techniques are an alternative to photolithography for manufacturing integrated circuits micro and nano fluidic devices and other devices with micrometer and or nanometer sized features. There is a need in the art however for new materials to advance IL techniques. See Xia Y. et al. 1998 37 550 575 Xia Y. et al. 1999 99 1823 1848 Resnick D. J. et al. 2002 71 78 Choi K. M. et al. 2003 125 40604061 McClelland G. M. et al. 2002 81 1483 Chou S. Y. et al. 1996 14 4129 Otto M. et al. 2001 57 361 and Bailey T. et al. 2000 18 3571.

Imprint lithography includes at least two areas 1 soft lithographic techniques see Xia Y. et al. 1998 37 550 575 such as solvent assisted micro molding SAMIM micro molding in capillaries MIMIC and microcontact printing MCP and 2 rigid imprint lithographic techniques such as nano contact molding NCM see McClelland G. M. et al. 2002 81 1483 Otto M. et al. 2001 57 361 step and flash imprint lithographic S FIL see Bailey T. et al. 2000 18 3571 and nanoimprint lithography NIL see Chou S. Y. et al. 1996 14 4129.

Polydimethylsiloxane PDMS based networks have been the material of choice for much of the work in soft lithography. See Quake S. R. et al. 2000 290 1536 Y. N. Xia and G. M. Whitesides 1998 37 551 and Y. N. Xia et al. 1999 99 1823.

The use of soft elastomeric materials such as PDMS offers several advantages for lithographic techniques. For example PDMS is highly transparent to ultraviolet UV radiation and has a very low Young s modulus approximately 750 kPa which gives it the flexibility required for conformal contact even over surface irregularities without the potential for cracking. In contrast cracking can occur with molds made from brittle high modulus materials such as etched silicon and glass. See Bietsch A. et al. 2000 88 43104318. Further flexibility in a mold facilitates the easy release of the mold from masters and replicates without cracking and allows the mold to endure multiple imprinting steps without damaging fragile features. Additionally many soft elastomeric materials are gas permeable a property that can be used to advantage in soft lithography applications.

Although PDMS offers some advantages in soft lithography applications several properties inherent to PDMS severely limit its capabilities in soft lithography. First PDMS based elastomers swell when exposed to most organic soluble compounds. See Lee J. N. et al. 2003 75 6544 6554. Although this property is beneficial in microcontact printing MCP applications because it allows the mold to adsorb organic inks see Xia Y. et al. 1998 37 550 575 swelling resistance is critically important in the majority of other soft lithographic techniques especially for SAMIM and MIMIC and for IL techniques in which a mold is brought into contact with a small amount of curable organic monomer or resin. Otherwise the fidelity of the features on the mold is lost and an unsolvable adhesion problem ensues due to infiltration of the curable liquid into the mold. Such problems commonly occur with PDMS based molds because most organic liquids swell PDMS. Organic materials however are the materials most desirable to mold. Additionally acidic or basic aqueous solutions react with PDMS causing breakage of the polymer chain.

Secondly the surface energy of PDMS approximately 25 mN m is not low enough for soft lithography procedures that require high fidelity. For this reason the patterned surface of PDMS based molds is often fluorinated using a plasma treatment followed by vapor deposition of a fluoroalkyl trichlorosilane. See Xia Y. et al. 1998 37 550 575. These fluorine treated silicones swell however when exposed to organic solvents.

Third the most commonly used commercially available form of the material used in PDMS molds e.g. Sylgard 184 Dow Corning Corporation Midland Mich. United States of America has a modulus that is too low approximately 1.5 MPa for many applications. The low modulus of these commonly used PDMS materials results in sagging and bending of features and as such is not well suited for processes that require precise pattern placement and alignment. Although researchers have attempted to address this last problem see Odom T. W. et al. 2002 124 12112 12113 Odom T. W. et al. 2002 18 5314 5320 Schmid H. et al. 2000 33 3042 3049 Csucs G. et al. 2003 19 6104 6109 Trimbach D. et al. 2003 19 10957 10961 the materials chosen still exhibit poor solvent resistance and require fluorination steps to allow for the release of the mold.

Rigid materials such as quartz glass and silicon also have been used in imprint lithography. See Xia Y. et al. 1998 37 550 575 Resnick D. J. et al. 2002 71 78 McClelland G. M. et al. 2002 81 1483 Chou S. Y. et al. 1996 14 4129 Otto M. et al. 2001 57 361 and Bailey T. et al. 2000 18 3571 Chou S. Y. et al. 1996 272 85 87 Von Werne T. A. et al. 2003 125 3831 3838 Resnick D. J. et al. 2003 21 2624 2631. These materials are superior to PDMS in modulus and swelling resistance but lack flexibility. Such lack of flexibility inhibits conformal contact with the substrate and causes defects in the mask and or replicate during separation.

Another drawback of rigid materials is the necessity to use a costly and difficult to fabricate hard mold which is typically made by using conventional photolithography or electron beam e beam lithography. See Chou S. Y. et al. 1996 14 4129. More recently the need to repeatedly use expensive quartz glass or silicon molds in NCM processes has been eliminated by using an acrylate based mold generated from casting a photopolymerizable monomer mixture against a silicon master. See McClelland G. M. et al. 2002 81 1483 and Jung G. Y. et al. 2004 ASAP. This approach also can be limited by swelling of the mold in organic solvents.

Despite such advances other disadvantages of fabricating molds from rigid materials include the necessity to use fluorination steps to lower the surface energy of the mold see Resnick D. J. et al. 2002 71 78 and the inherent problem of releasing a rigid mold from a rigid substrate without breaking or damaging the mold or the substrate. See Resnick D. J. et al. 2002 71 78 Bietsch A 2000 88 4310 4318. Khang D. Y. et al. 2004 20 2445 2448 have reported the use of rigid molds composed of thermoformed Teflon AF DuPont Wilmington Del. United States of America to address the surface energy problem. Fabrication of these molds however requires high temperatures and pressures in a melt press a process that could be damaging to the delicate features on a silicon wafer master. Additionally these molds still exhibit the intrinsic drawbacks of other rigid materials as outlined hereinabove.

Further a clear and important limitation of fabricating structures on semiconductor devices using molds or templates made from hard materials is the usual formation of a residual or scum layer that forms when a rigid template is brought into contact with a substrate. Even with elevated applied forces it is very difficult to completely displace liquids during this process due to the wetting behavior of the liquid being molded which results in the formation of a scum layer. Thus there is a need in the art for a method of fabricating a pattern or a structure on a substrate such as a semiconductor device which does not result in the formation of a scum layer.

The fabrication of solvent resistant microfluidic devices with features on the order of hundreds of microns from photocurable perfluoropolyether PFPE has been reported. See Rolland J. P. et al. 2004 126 2322 2323. PFPE based materials are liquids at room temperature and can be photochemically cross linked to yield tough durable elastomers. Further PFPE based materials are highly fluorinated and resist swelling by organic solvents such as methylene chloride tetrahydrofuran toluene hexanes and acetonitrile among others which are desirable for use in microchemistry platforms based on elastomeric microfluidic devices. There is a need in the art however to apply PFPE based materials to the fabrication of nanoscale devices for related reasons.

Further there is a need in the art for improved methods for forming a pattern on a substrate such as method employing a patterned mask. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 735 890 to Nakane et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 147 763 to Kamitakahara et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 259 926 to Kuwabara et al. and International PCT Publication No. WO 99 54786 to Jackson et al. each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

There also is a need in the art for an improved method for forming isolated structures that can be considered engineered structures including but not limited to particles shapes and parts. Using traditional IL methods the scum layer that almost always forms between structures acts to connect or link structures together thereby making it difficult if not impossible to fabricate and or harvest isolated structures.

There also is a need in the art for an improved method for forming micro and nanoscale charged particles in particular polymer electrets. The term polymer electrets refers to dielectrics with stored charge either on the surface or in the bulk and dielectrics with oriented dipoles frozen in ferrielectric or ferroelectric. On the macro scale such materials are used for example for electronic packaging and charge electret devices such as microphones and the like. See Kressman. R. et al. Vol. 2 Laplacian Press 1999 and Harrison J. S. et al. NASA CR 2001 211422 ICASE Report No. 200143. Poly vinylidene fluoride PVDF is one example of a polymer electret material. In addition to PVDF charge electret materials such as polypropylene PP Teflon fluorinated ethylene propylene FEP and polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE also are considered polymer electrets.

Further there is a need in the art for improved methods for delivering therapeutic agents such as drugs non viral gene vectors DNA RNA RNAi and viral particles to a target. See Biomedical Polymers Shalaby S. W. ed. Harner Gardner Publications Inc. Cincinnati Ohio 1994 Dumitrin S. ed. Marcel Dekkar Inc. New York N.Y. 1994 Park K. et al. Technomic Publishing Company Inc. Lancaster Pa. 1993 Gumargalieva et al. Nova Science Publishers Inc. Commack N.Y. 1998 American Chemical Society Symposium Series 752 Park K. and Mrsny R. J. eds. Washington D.C. 2000 Lu D. R. and Oie S. eds. Humana Press Totowa N.J. 2004 and Roche E. B. ed. Pergamon Press New York N.Y. 1987. For a description of representative therapeutic agents for use in such delivery methods see U.S. Pat. No. 6 159 443 to Hallahan which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

There is also a need in the art for an improved method for forming super absorbent particles. These particles can be used for specialty packaging wire waterblocking filtration medical markets spill control therapy packs composites and laminates water retention.

There is also a need in the art for improved methods to create polymorphs. Polymorphs exist when there is more than one way for the particles of a particular substance to arrange themselves into a crystalline array. Different polymorphs of the same substance can have vastly different physical and chemical properties. Invariably one of the crystal forms may be more stable or easier to handle than another although the conditions under which the various crystal forms appears may be so close as to be very difficult to control on the large scale. This effect can create differences in the bioavailability of the drug which leads to inconsistencies in efficacy. See Drug polymorphism and dosage form design a practical perspective . Singhal D Curatolo W. Feb. 23 2004 56 3 33547 Shargel L. ed. Marcel Dekker New York 2005.

In sum there exists a need in the art to identify new materials for use in imprint lithographic techniques. More particularly there is a need in the art for methods for the fabrication of structures at the hundreds of micron level down to sub 100 nm feature sizes. Additionally there is a need in the art for improved methods for polymorph creation.

The presently disclosed subject matter will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Examples in which representative embodiments are shown. The presently disclosed subject matter can however be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the embodiments to those skilled in the art.

Unless otherwise defined all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this presently described subject matter belongs. All publications patent applications patents and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Throughout the specification and claims a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all optical and stereoisomers as well as racemic mixtures where such isomers and mixtures exist.

The presently disclosed subject matter broadly describes solvent resistant low surface energy polymeric materials derived from casting low viscosity liquid materials onto a master template and then curing the low viscosity liquid materials to generate a patterned template for use in high resolution soft or imprint lithographic applications such as micro and nanoscale replica molding. In some embodiments the patterned template includes a solvent resistant elastomer based material such as but not limited to a fluorinated elastomer based material.

Further the presently disclosed subject matter describes the first nano contact molding of organic materials to generate high fidelity features using an elastomeric mold. Accordingly the presently disclosed subject matter describes a method for producing free standing isolated micro and nanostructures of any shape using soft or imprint lithography techniques. Representative micro and nanostructures include but are not limited to micro and nanoparticles and micro and nano patterned substrates.

The nanostructures described by the presently disclosed subject matter can be used in several applications including but not limited to semiconductor manufacturing such as molding etch barriers without scum layers for the fabrication of semiconductor devices crystals materials for displays photovoltaics a solar cell device optoelectronic devices routers gratings radio frequency identification RFID devices catalysts fillers and additives detoxifying agents etch barriers atomic force microscope AFM tips parts for nano machines the delivery of a therapeutic agent such as a drug or genetic material cosmetics chemical mechanical planarization CMP particles and porous particles and shapes of any kind that will enable the nanotechnology industry.

Representative solvent resistant elastomer based materials include but are not limited to fluorinated elastomer based materials. As used herein the term solvent resistant refers to a material such as an elastomeric material that neither swells nor dissolves in common hydrocarbon based organic solvents or acidic or basic aqueous solutions. Representative fluorinated elastomer based materials include but are not limited to perfluoropolyether PFPE based materials. A photocurable liquid PFPE exhibits desirable properties for soft lithography. A representative scheme for the synthesis and photocuring of functional PFPEs is provided in Scheme 1.

According to another embodiment a material according to the presently disclosed subject matter includes one or more of a photo curable constituent a thermal curable constituent and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the photo curable constituent is independent from the thermal curable constituent such that the material can undergo multiple cures. A material having the ability to undergo multiple cures is useful for example in forming layered devices. For example a liquid material having photo curable and thermal curable constituents can undergo a first cure to form a first device through for example a photocuring process or a thermal curing process. Then the photocured or thermal cured first device can be adhered to a second device of the same material or any material similar thereto that will thermally cure or photocure and bind to the material of the first device. By positioning the first device and second device adjacent one another and subjecting the first and second devices to a thermalcuring or photocuring process whichever component that was not activated on the first curing can be cured by a subsequent curing step. Thereafter either the thermalcure constituents of the first device that was left un activated by the photocuring process or the photocure constituents of the first device that were left un activated by the first thermal curing will be activated and bind the second device. Thereby the first and second devices become adhered together. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the order of curing processes is independent and a thermal curing could occur first followed by a photocuring or a photocuring could occur first followed by a thermal curing.

According to yet another embodiment multiple thermo curable constituents can be included in the material such that the material can be subjected to multiple independent thermal cures. For example the multiple thermo curable constituents can have different activation temperature ranges such that the material can undergo a first thermal cure at a first temperature range and a second thermal cure at a second temperature range.

Additional schemes for the synthesis of functional perfluoropolyethers are provided in Examples 7.1 through 7.6.

According to one embodiment this PFPE material has a surface energy below about 30 mN m. According to another embodiment the surface energy of the PFPE is between about 10 mN m and about 20 mN m. According to a another embodiment the PFPE has a low surface energy of between about 12 mN m and about 15 mN m. The PFPE is non toxic UV transparent and highly gas permeable and cures into a tough durable highly fluorinated elastomer with excellent release properties and resistance to swelling. The properties of these materials can be tuned over a wide range through the judicious choice of additives fillers reactive co monomers and functionalization agents. Such properties that are desirable to modify include but are not limited to modulus tear strength surface energy permeability functionality mode of cure solubility and swelling characteristics and the like. The non swelling nature and easy release properties of the presently disclosed PFPE materials allows for nanostructures to be fabricated from any material. Further the presently disclosed subject matter can be expanded to large scale rollers or conveyor belt technology or rapid stamping that allow for the fabrication of nanostructures on an industrial scale.

In some embodiments at least one of the patterned template and the substrate has a surface energy lower than about 18 mN m. In some embodiments at least one of the patterned template and the substrate has a surface energy lower than about 15 mN m. According to a further embodiment the patterned template and or the substrate has a surface energy between about 10 mN m and about 20 mN m. According to another embodiment the patterned template and or the substrate has a low surface energy of between about 12 mN m and about 15 mN m.

From a property point of view the exact properties of these molding materials can be adjusted by adjusting the composition of the ingredients used to make the materials. In particular the modulus can be adjusted from low approximately 1 MPa to multiple GPa.

According to still further embodiments contrast agents can be included with the material from which the particles are formed. Adding contrast agents enhances diagnostic imaging of physiologic structures for clinical evaluations and other testing. For example ultrasound imaging techniques often involve the use of contrast agents as contrast agents can serve to improve the quality and usefulness of images which are obtained with ultrasound. The viability of currently available ultrasound contrast agents and methods involving their use is highly dependent on a variety of factors including the particular region being imaged. For example difficulty is encountered in obtaining useful diagnostic images of heart tissue and the surrounding vasculature due at least in part to the large volume of blood which flows through the chambers of the heart relative to the volume of blood which flows in the blood vessels of the heart tissue itself. The high volume of blood flowing through the chambers of the heart can result in insufficient contrast in ultrasound images of the heart region especially the heart tissue. The high volume of blood flowing through the chambers of the heart also can produce diagnostic artifacts including for example shadowing or darkening in ultrasound images of the heart. Diagnostic artifacts can be highly undesirable since they can hamper or even prevent visualization of a region of interest. Thus in certain circumstances diagnostic artifacts can render a diagnostic image substantially unusable.

In addition to ultrasound computed tomography CT is a valuable diagnostic imaging technique for studying various areas of the body. Like ultrasound CT imaging is greatly enhanced with the aid of contrast agents. In CT the radiodensity electron density of matter is measured. Because of the similarity in the measured densities of various tissues in the body it has been necessary to use contrast agents which can change the relative densities of different tissues. This characteristic has resulted in an overall improvement in the diagnostic efficacy of CT. Barium and iodine compounds for example have been developed for this purpose and can be included with the particles of the presently disclosed subject matter in some embodiments. Accordingly in other embodiments contrast agents that can be used with the materials of the presently disclosed subject matter include for example but are not limited to barium sulfate lodinated water soluble contrast media combinations thereof and the like.

Further uses of the micro and or nano particles include medical treatments such as orthopedic oral maxillofacial and the like. For example the particles described above that are or include pharmaceutical agents can be used in combination with traditional hygiene and or surgical procedures. According to such an application the particles can be used to directly and locally deliver pharmaceutical agents or the like to an area of surgical interest. In some embodiments medications used in oral medicine can fight oral diseases prevent or treat infections control pain relieve anxiety assist in the regeneration of damaged tissue combinations thereof and the like. For example during oral or maxillofacial treatments bleeding often occurs. As a result bacteria from the mouth can directly enter the bloodstream and easily reach the heart. This occurrence presents a risk for some persons with cardiac abnormalities because the bacteria can cause bacterial endocarditis a serious inflammation of the heart valves or tissues. Antibiotics reduce this risk. Traditional antibiotic delivery techniques however can be slow to reach the bloodstream thus giving the bacterial a head start. To the contrary applying particles of the presently disclosed subject matter made from or including appropriate antibiotics directly to the site of oral or maxillofacial treatment can greatly reduce the probability of a serious bacterial infection. Such procedures aided by the particles can include professional teeth cleaning incision and drainage of infected oral tissue oral injections extractions surgeries that involve the maxillary sinus combinations thereof and the like.

Further embodiments include particles having a composition for the repair and healing of tissue bone defects and bone voids resins for artificial teeth resins for tooth bed and other tooth fillers. For example particles can be constructed from calcium based component such as but not limited to calcium phosphates calcium sulfates calcium carbonates calcium bone cements amorphous calcium phosphate crystalline calcium phosphate combinations thereof and the like. In use such particles can be locally applied to a site of orthopedic treatment to facilitate recovery of the natural bone material. Furthermore because of the small size of the particles and the ability to form the particles in practically any shape and configuration desirable the particles can be administered to a site of orthopedic interest and interact with the site on a scale of the particle size. That is the particles can integrate into very small spaces cracks gaps and the like within the bone such as a bone fracture or between the bone and an implant. Thus the particles can deliver pharmaceutical regenerative or the like materials to the orthopedic treatment site and integrate these materials where they were not previously applyable. Still further the particles can increase the mechanical strength and integrity of fixation of a bone implant such as an artificial joint fixation because due to control over the size and shape of the particles they can neatly and orderly fill small voids between the implant and the natural bone tissue.

In other embodiments medications to control pain and anxiety that are commonly used in oral maxillofacial orthopedic and other procedures can be included in the particles. Such agents that can be incorporated with the particle include but are not limited to anti inflammatory medications that are used to relieve the discomfort of mouth and gum problems and can include corticosteroids opioids carprofen meloxicam etodolac diclofenac flurbiprofen ibuprofen ketorolac nabumetone naproxen naproxen sodium and oxaprozin.

Oral antibiotics can include chlorhexidine doxycycline demeclocycline minocycline oxytetracycline tetracycline triclosan clindamycin orfloxacin metronidazole tinidazole and ketoconazole. Fluoride also can be or be included in the particles of the presently disclosed subject matter and is used to prevent tooth decay. Fluoride is absorbed by teeth and helps strengthen teeth to resist acid and block the cavity forming action of bacteria. As a varnish or a mouth rinse fluoride helps reduce tooth sensitivity. Other useful agents for dental applications are substances such as flavonoids benzenecarboxylic acids benzopyrones steroids pilocarpine terpenes and the like. Still further agents used within the particles include anethole anisaldehyde anisic acid cinnamic acid asarone furfuryl alcohol furfural cholic acid oleanolic acid ursolic acid sitosterol cineol curcumine alanine arginine homocerine mannitol berterine bergapten santonin caryophyllene caryophyllene oxide terpinene chymol terpinol carvacrol carvone sabinene inulin lawsone hesperedin naringenin flavone flavonol quercetin apigenin formonoretin coumarin acetyl coumarin magnolol honokiol cappilarin aloetin and the like.

In some embodiments the low surface energy polymeric precursor includes a perfluoropolyether PFPE functionally terminated diacrylate. In some embodiments the natural structure single molecule and or self assembled structure includes without limitation one or more of enzymes viruses antibodies micelles tissue surfaces combinations thereof or the like.

In some embodiments the impression or mold is used to replicate the features of the natural structure single molecule and or a self assembled structure into an isolated object or a surface. In some embodiments a non wetting imprint lithography method is used to impart the features into a molded part or surface. In some embodiments the molded part or surface produced by this process can be used in many applications including but not limited to drug delivery medical devices coatings catalysts or mimics of the natural structures from which they are derived. In some embodiments the natural structure includes biological tissue. In some embodiments the biological tissue includes tissue from a bodily organ such as a heart. In some embodiments the biological tissue includes vessels and bone. In some embodiments the biological tissue includes tendon or cartilage. For example in some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter can be used to pattern surfaces for tendon and cartilage repair. Such repair typically requires the use of collagen tissue which comes from cadavers and must be machined for use as replacements. Most of these replacements fail because one cannot lay down the primary pattern that is required for replacement. The soft lithographic methods described herein alleviate this problem.

In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter can be applied to tissue regeneration using stem cells. Almost all stem cell approaches known in the art require molecular patterns for the cells to seed and then grow thereby taking the shape of an organ such as a liver a kidney or the like.

In some embodiments the molded mimics function as a vaccine. In some embodiments the efficacy of the biologically active shape of the molded mimics is enhanced by a surface modification technique.

According to some embodiments the materials and methods of the presently disclosed subject matter can be used with molecular imprinting techniques to form polymers with recognition cites. Drug research and development often requires the analysis of highly specific and sensitive chemical and or biologic agents collectively called recognition agents. Natural recognition agents such as for example enzymes proteins drug candidates biomolecules herbicides amino acids derivatives of amino acids peptides nucleotides nucleotide bases combinations thereof and the like tend to be very specific and sensitive as well as being labile and have a low density of binding sites. Because of the delicacy of natural recognition agents artificial recognition agents are more stable and have become popular research tools. Molecular imprinting has emerged in recent years as a highly accepted tool for the development of artificial recognition agents.

Imprinting of molecules occurs by the polymerization of functional and cross linking monomers in the presence of a template molecule. First a template molecule such as by way of example but not limitation an enzyme a protein a drug candidate a biomolecule a herbicide an amino acid a derivative of an amino acid a peptide nucleotides nucleotide bases a virus combinations thereof and the like is introduced to a liquid polymer solution. In some embodiments the liquid polymer solution is a liquid polymer of the presently disclosed subject matter and includes functional and cross linked monomers. The functional and cross linked monomers are allowed to establish bond formations and other chemical and physical associations and orientations with the template in the polymer. In some embodiments a functional monomer includes two functional groups. At one end of the monomer the monomer is configured to interact with the template for example through noncovalent interactions i.e. hydrogen bonding van der Waals forces or hydrophobic interactions . The other end of the monomer i.e. the end that is not interacting with the template includes a group that is able to bind with the polymer. During polymerization the monomers are locked in position around the template for example with covalent binding and remain in such a position after the template is removed.

After polymerization or curing the template is removed from the polymer. The template can be removed by dissolving the template in a solvent in some embodiments. The resultant imprint of the template has a steric size and shape and chemical spatial arrangements or complementary functionality memory of the template. After polymerization and removal of the template the functional groups of the polymers molecular imprint can then bind a target provided that the binding sites of the imprint and the target molecule complement each other in size shape and chemical functionality. This process provides a material with a high stability against physicochemical perturbations that has specificity toward a target molecule and as such the material can be used in high throughput assays and in conjunction with physical and chemical parameters that a natural recognition agent cannot withstand.

According to some embodiments applications of molecular imprinting include but are not limited to purification separation screening of bioactive molecules sensors catalysis chromatographic separation drug screening chemosensors catalysis biodefense immunoassays combinations thereof and the like.

After forming the functionalized molecular imprint mold in the polymer material a polymer precursor solution including but not limited to functional and cross linked monomers can be applied to the functionalized imprint mold in accord with the materials and methods disclosed herein to form an artificial functional molecule. During molding of the artificial functional molecule the functionalized monomers in the polymer precursor will align with the functionalized parts of the imprint mold such that the artificial functional molecule will posses a steric size and shape and chemical spatial arrangements or complementary functionality memory of the imprint mold. The artificial functional molecule which is the steric and chemical memory of the imprint mold has similar chemical and physical properties to the original template molecule and can trigger membrane channels bind to receptors enter cells interact with proteins and enzymes trigger immune responses trigger physiological responses trigger release of bioregulatory agents such as for example hormones feel good molecules neurotransmitters and the like inhibit responses trigger regulatory functions combinations thereof and the like.

Further the presently disclosed analysis systems made of the materials and methods of the presently disclosed subject matter are economical to manufacture increase throughput of drug and biomolecule research and development and the like.

The PFPE mixture is then cured such that artificial functional molecules are formed in imprint cavity and mimic template molecule both stericly and chemically. Artificial functional molecules are then removed from the substrate as described herein.

The following Examples have been included to provide guidance to one of ordinary skill in the art for practicing representative embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. In light of the present disclosure and the general level of skill in the art those of skill can appreciate that the following Examples are intended to be exemplary only and that numerous changes modifications and alterations can be employed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter.

In some embodiments the synthesis and curing of PFPE materials of the presently disclosed subject matter is performed by using the method described by Rolland J. P. et al. 2004 126 2322 2323. Briefly this method involves the methacrylate functionalization of a commercially available PFPE diol M 3800 g mol with isocyanatoethyl methacrylate. Subsequent photocuring of the material is accomplished through blending with 1 wt of 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenylacetophenone and exposure to UV radiation 365 nm .

More particularly in a typical preparation of perfluoropolyether dimethacrylate PFPE DMA poly tetrafluoroethylene oxide co difluoromethylene oxide diol ZDOL average Mca. 3 800 g mol 95 Aldrich Chemical Company Milwaukee Wis. United States of America 5.7227 g 1.5 mmol was added to a dry 50 mL round bottom flask and purged with argon for 15 minutes. 2 isocyanatoethyl methacrylate EIM 99 Aldrich 0.43 mL 3.0 mmol was then added via syringe along with 1 1 2 trichlorotrifluoroethane Freon 113 99 Aldrich 2 mL and dibutyltin diacetate DBTDA 99 Aldrich 50 L . The solution was immersed in an oil bath and allowed to stir at 50 C. for 24 h. The solution was then passed through a chromatographic column alumina Freon 113 2 5 cm . Evaporation of the solvent yielded a clear colorless viscous oil which was further purified by passage through a 0.22 m polyethersulfone filter.

In a representative curing procedure for PFPE DMA 1 wt of 2 2 dimethoxy 2 phenyl acetophenone DMPA 99 Aldrich 0.05 g 2.0 mmol was added to PFPE DMA 5 g 1.2 mmol along with 2 mL Freon 113 until a clear solution was formed. After removal of the solvent the cloudy viscous oil was passed through a 0.22 m polyethersulfone filter to remove any DMPA that did not disperse into the PFPE DMA. The filtered PFPE DMA was then irradiated with a UV source Electro Lite Corporation Danbury Conn. United States of America UV curing chamber model no. 81432 ELC 500 365 nm while under a nitrogen purge for 10 min. This resulted in a clear slightly yellow rubbery material.

In some embodiments a PFPE DMA device such as a stamp was fabricated according to the method described by Rolland J. P. et al. 2004 126 2322 2323. Briefly the PFPE DMA containing a photoinitiator such as DMPA was spin coated 800 rpm to a thickness of 20 m onto a Si wafer containing the desired photoresist pattern. This coated wafer was then placed into the UV curing chamber and irradiated for 6 seconds. Separately a thick layer about 5 mm of the material was produced by pouring the PFPE DMA containing photoinitiator into a mold surrounding the Si wafer containing the desired photoresist pattern. This wafer was irradiated with UV light for one minute. Following this the thick layer was removed.

5.1. Fabrication of a Perfluoropolyether Dimethacrylate PFPE DMA Mold from a Template Generated Using Electron Beam Lithography

A template or master for perfluoropolyether dimethacrylate PFPE DMA mold fabrication is generated using electron beam lithography by spin coating a bilayer resist of 200 000 MW PMMA and 900 000 MW PMMA onto a silicon wafer with 500 nm thermal oxide and exposing this resist layer to an electron beam that is translating in a pre programmed pattern. The resist is developed in 3 1 isopropanol methyl isobutyl ketone solution to remove exposed regions of the resist. A corresponding metal pattern is formed on the silicon oxide surface by evaporating 5 nm Cr and 15 nm Au onto the resist covered surface and lifting off the residual PMMA Cr Au film in refluxing acetone. This pattern is transferred to the underlying silicon oxide surface by reactive ion etching with CF Oplasma and removal of the Cr Au film in aqua regia. .

In some embodiments the presently disclosed subject matter describes a novel top down soft lithographic technique non wetting imprint lithography NoWIL which allows completely isolated nanostructures to be generated by taking advantage of the inherent low surface energy and swelling resistance of cured PFPE based materials.

The presently described subject matter provides a novel top down soft lithographic technique non wetting imprint lithography NoWIL which allows completely isolated nanostructures to be generated by taking advantage of the inherent low surface energy and swelling resistance of cured PFPE based materials. Without being bound to any one particular theory a key aspect of NoWIL is that both the elastomeric mold and the surface underneath the drop of monomer or resin are non wetting to this droplet. If the droplet wets this surface a thin scum layer will inevitably be present even if high pressures are exerted upon the mold. When both the elastomeric mold and the surface are non wetting i.e. a PFPE mold and fluorinated surface the liquid is confined only to the features of the mold and the scum layer is eliminated as a seal forms between the elastomeric mold and the surface under a slight pressure. Thus the presently disclosed subject matter provides for the first time a simple general soft lithographic method to produce nanoparticles of nearly any material size and shape that are limited only by the original master used to generate the mold.

Using NoWIL nanoparticles composed of 3 different polymers were generated from a variety of engineered silicon masters. Representative patterns include but are not limited to 3 m arrows see conical shapes that are 500 nm at the base and converge to 

Polyethylene glycol PEG is a material of interest for drug delivery applications because it is readily available non toxic and biocompatible. The use of PEG nanoparticles generated by inverse microemulsions to be used as gene delivery vectors has previously been reported. K. McAllister et al. 124 15198 15207 Dec. 25 2002 . In the presently disclosed subject matter NoWIL was performed using a commercially available PEG diacrylate and blending it with 1 wt of a photoinitiator 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone. PFPE molds were generated from a variety of patterned silicon substrates using a dimethacrylate functionalized PFPE oligomer PFPE DMA as described previously. See J. P. Rolland E. C. Hagberg G. M. Denison K. R. Carter J. M. DeSimone 43 5796 5799 2004 . In one embodiment flat uniform non wetting surfaces were generated by using a silicon wafer treated with a fluoroalkyl trichlorosilane or by casting a film of PFPE DMA on a flat surface and photocuring. A small drop of PEG diacrylate was then placed on the non wetting surface and the patterned PFPE mold placed on top of it. The substrate was then placed in a molding apparatus and a small pressure was applied to push out the excess PEG diacrylate. The entire apparatus was then subjected to UV light A 365 nm for ten minutes while under a nitrogen purge. Particles were observed after separation of the PFPE mold and flat non wetting substrate using optical microscopy scanning electron microscopy SEM and atomic force microscopy AFM .

Poly lactic acid PLA and derivatives thereof such as poly lactide co glycolide PLGA have had a considerable impact on the drug delivery and medical device communities because it is biodegradable. See K. E. Uhrich S. M. Cannizzaro R. S. Langer K. M. Shakesheff 99 3181 3198 November 1999 A. C. Albertsson I. K. Varma 4 1466 1486 November December 2003 . As with PEG based systems progress has been made toward the fabrication of PLGA particles through various dispersion techniques that result in size distributions and are strictly limited to spherical shapes. See C. Cui S. P. Schwendeman 34 8426 2001 .

The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates the use of NoWIL to generate discrete PLA particles with total control over shape and size distribution. For example in one embodiment one gram of 3S cis 3 6 dimethyl 1 4 dioxane 2 5 dione was heated above its melting temperature to 110 C. and 20 L of stannous octoate catalyst initiator was added to the liquid monomer. A drop of the PLA monomer solution was then placed into a preheated molding apparatus which contained a non wetting flat substrate and mold. A small pressure was applied as previously described to push out excess PLA monomer. The apparatus was allowed to heat at 110 C. for 15 h until the polymerization was complete. The PFPE DMA mold and the flat non wetting substrate were then separated to reveal the PLA particles.

To further demonstrate the versatility of NoWIL particles composed of a conducting polymer polypyrrole PPy were generated. PPy particles have been formed using dispersion methods see M. R. Simmons P. A. Chaloner S. P. Armes 11 4222 1995 as well as lost wax techniques see P. Jiang J. F. Bertone V. L. Colvin 291 453 2001 .

The presently disclosed subject matter demonstrates for the first time complete control over shape and size distribution of PPy particles. Pyrrole is known to polymerize instantaneously when in contact with oxidants such as perchloric acid. Dravid et al. has shown that this polymerization can be retarded by the addition of tetrahydrofuran THF to the pyrrole. See M. Su M. Aslam L. Fu N. Q. Wu V. P. Dravid 84 4200 4202 May 24 2004 .

The presently disclosed subject matter takes advantage of this property in the formation of PPy particles by NoWIL. For example 50 L of a 1 1 v v solution of THF pyrrole was added to 50 L of 70 perchloric acid. A drop of this clear brown solution prior to complete polymerization into the molding apparatus and applied pressure to remove excess solution. The apparatus was then placed into the vacuum oven overnight to remove the THF and water. PPy particles were fabricated with good fidelity using the same masters as previously described.

Importantly the materials properties and polymerization mechanisms of PLA PEG and PPy are completely different. For example while PLA is a high modulus semicrystalline polymer formed using a metal catalyzed ring opening polymerization at high temperature PEG is a malleable waxy solid that is photocured free radically and PPy is a conducting polymer polymerized using harsh oxidants. The fact that NoWIL can be used to fabricate particles from these diverse classes of polymeric materials that require very different reaction conditions underscores its generality and importance.

In addition to its ability to precisely control the size and shape of particles NoWIL offers tremendous opportunities for the facile encapsulation of agents into nanoparticles. As described in Example 3 14 NoWIL can be used to encapsulate a 24 mer DNA strand fluorescently tagged with CY 3 inside the previously described 200 nm trapezoidal PEG particles. This was accomplished by simply adding the DNA to the monomer water solution and molding them as described. We were able to confirm the encapsulation by observing the particles using confocal fluorescence microscopy see . The presently described approach offers a distinct advantage over other encapsulation methods in that no surfactants condensation agents and the like are required. Furthermore the fabrication of monodisperse 200 nm particles containing DNA represents a breakthrough step towards artificial viruses. Accordingly a host of biologically important agents such as gene fragments pharmaceuticals oligonucleotides and viruses can be encapsulated by this method.

The method also is amenable to non biologically oriented agents such as metal nanoparticles crystals or catalysts. Further the simplicity of this system allows for straightforward adjustment of particle properties such as crosslink density charge and composition by the addition of other comonomers and combinatorial generation of particle formulations that can be tailored for specific applications.

Accordingly NoWIL is a highly versatile method for the production of isolated discrete nanostructures of nearly any size and shape. The shapes presented herein were engineered non arbitrary shapes. NoWIL can easily be used to mold and replicate non engineered shapes found in nature such as viruses crystals proteins and the like. Furthermore the technique can generate particles from a wide variety of organic and inorganic materials containing nearly any cargo. The method is simplistically elegant in that it does not involve complex surfactants or reaction conditions to generate nanoparticles. Finally the process can be amplified to an industrial scale by using existing soft lithography roller technology see Y. N. Xia D. Qin G. M. Whitesides 8 1015 1017 December 1996 or silk screen printing methods.

7.1. Synthesis of Krytox DuPont Wilmington Del. United States of America Diol to be Used as a Functional PFPE

To demonstrate the utility and flexibility of PRINT shape specific organic particles composed of three different materials were generated from a commercially available silicon template that is composed of a 2 dimensional array of 200 nm trapezoids. Elastomeric PFPE replica molds of the silicon master templates were generated by pouring a PFPE dimethacrylate PFPE DMA containing 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone over the silicon substrate patterned with 200 nm trapezoidal shapes. A poly dimethylsiloxane perimeter mold is used to confine the liquid PFPE DMA to a desired area. The apparatus was then subjected to UV light 365 nm for 10 minutes while under a nitrogen purge. The fully cured PFPE DMA mold was then released from the silicon master. This process was repeated to obtain several molds of the same master.

To fabricate monodisperse PLA particles using the PRINT process one gram of 3S cis 3 6 dimethyl 1 4 dioxane 2 5 dione melting point 92 C. was heated to 110 C. and approximately 20 L of stannous octoate catalyst initiator is added to the liquid monomer. Flat uniform non wetting surfaces are generated by treating a silicon wafer cleaned with piranha solution 1 1 concentrated sulfuric acid 30 hydrogen peroxide aq solution with trichloro 1H 1H 2H 2H perfluorooctyl silane via vapor deposition in a desiccator for 20 minutes. Following this 50 L of molten Lactic acid containing catalyst is then placed on the treated silicon wafer preheated to 110 C. and the patterned PFPE mold is placed on top of it. A small pressure is applied to the top of the mold with a planar surface to push out excess monomer. The entire apparatus is then placed in an oven at 110 C. for 15 hours. After polymerization was achieved the PFPE mold and the flat nonwetting substrate were separated to reveal monodisperse 200 nm trapezoidal particles .

To further demonstrate the versatility and breadth of the PRINT technique we chose to generate specifically shaped particles of 200 nm trapezoids from poly pyrrole PPy . PPy has been used in a variety of applications ranging from electronic devices and sensors to cell scaffolds. We fabricated PPy particles via one step polymerization using the following method flat uniform non wetting surfaces are generated by treating a silicon wafer cleaned with piranha solution 1 1 concentrated sulfuric acid 30 hydrogen peroxide aq solution with trichloro 1H 1H 2H 2H perfluorooctyl silane via vapor deposition in a desiccator for 20 minutes. Separately 50 L of a 1 1 v v solution of tetrahydrofuran pyrrole is added to 50 L of 70 perchloric acid aq . A clear homogenous brown solution quickly forms and develops into black solid polypyrrole in 15 minutes. A drop of this clear brown solution prior to complete polymerization is placed onto a treated silicon wafer the PFPE mold is placed on top and pressure is applied with a planar surface to remove excess solution. The apparatus is then placed into a vacuum oven for 15 h to remove the THF and water. Particles are observed using scanning electron microscopy SEM see after release of the vacuum and separation of the PFPE mold and the treated silicon wafer.

Trapezoidal trimethylopropane triacrylate TMPTA particles were also generated using a photopolymerization technique. TMPTA is blended with 1 wt of a photoinitiator 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone. Uniform non wetting surfaces are generated by pouring a PFPE dimethacrylate PFPE DMA containing 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone over a silicon wafer. The wafer was then subjected to UV light 365 nm for 10 minutes while under a nitrogen purge. The fully cured PFPE DMA substrate was then released from the silicon master. Following this 50 L of TMPTA is then placed on the PFPE substrate and the patterned PFPE mold placed on top of it. The substrate is then placed on a flat surface and a small pressure is applied to push out excess TMPTA. The entire apparatus is then subjected to UV light 365 nm for ten minutes while under a nitrogen purge. Particles are observed after separation of the PFPE mold and the treated silicon wafer using scanning electron microscopy SEM . A flat blade was pushed along the surface to gather the fabricated 200 nm particles see .

Particles of the same unique dimensions made using these three different polymerization methods were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The NIH Image program was used to measure the particle dimensions on the micrographs and compare them to images of the master template.

Poly ethylene glycol PEG is a material of tremendous interest to the biotechnology community due to its commercial availability nontoxic nature and biocompatibility. Here the PRINT was utilized to produce monodisperse micro and nanometer scale PEG particles in a variety of shapes by molding a PEG diacrylate liquid monomer followed by room temperature photopolymerization. Because the morphology of the particles is controlled by the master it is possible to generate complex particles on a variety of length scales.

A patterned perfluoropolyether PFPE molds are generated by pouring a PFPE dimethacrylate PFPE DMA containing 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone over a silicon substrate patterned with the desired shape. The silicon masters used include 200 nm trapezoidal features 200 nm 800 nm bars 500 nm conical features that are 

Confirmation of the structural similarity between the silicon master and replicate PEG particles was confirmed via atomic force microscopy AFM and scanning electron microscopy SEM . Atomic Force Microscopy was performed on a Nanoscope IIIa Multimode AFM in tapping mode. Dynamic light scattering DLS is performed on particles suspended in phosphate buffered saline solution PBS to look for aggregation. This technique is designed for spherical particles however we can use the values empirically to look for large aggregates some non uniformity in size will be seen at a scale smaller than that of the particle diameter due to the non spherical shapes of the particles An example DLS trace is given in with the value measured for the particle size as 0.62 0.2 m. The line indicates monodispersity of the particles with no aggregation occurring.

8.3 Utilizing PRINT Technology to Create Free Flowing Particles Particles on a Scum Layer and Particles on a Film

The PRINT technology can be used to generate a variety of products having varying forms including free flowing particles and particles in an array on a film. The following example shows our ability to make poly ethylene glycol PEG based particles free flowing as an array on a PEG film and as an array on a different polymer film.

Free flowing Particles A patterned perfluoropolyether PFPE mold was generated by pouring a PFPE dimethacrylate PFPE DMA containing 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone over a silicon substrate patterned with 200 nm tall 200 nm diameter cylinders. The PFPE DMA covered master was then subjected to UV light 365 nm for 3 minutes while under a nitrogen purge. The fully cured PFPE DMA mold was then released from the silicon master. Separately a mixture of 790 mg trimethylolpropane ethoxylate triacrylate 200 mg polyethylene glycol carbonylimidizole monomethacrylate and 10 mg diethoxyacetophenone was prepared. This mixture was spotted directly onto the patterned PFPE DMA mold and covered with an unpatterned polyethylene PE film. The monomer mixture was pressed between the two polymer sheets and then the PE sheet was slowly peeled from the patterned PFPE DMA to remove any excess monomer solution from the surface of the PFPE DMA mold. The mold was then subjected to UV light 365 nm for 2 minutes while maintaining a nitrogen purge. The particles were harvested by placing 2 mL of DMSO on the mold and scrapping the surface with a glass slide. The particle suspension was transferred to a scintillation vial. One drop of the suspension was placed on a SEM stub and the solvent was allowed to evaporate. The stub was coated with approximately 10 angstroms of gold and imaged with SEM .

Particles on a PEG film A patterned perfluoropolyether PFPE mold is generated by pouring a PFPE dimethacrylate PFPE DMA containing 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone over a 6 inch silicon substrate patterned with 200 nm cylindrical shapes.

Separately a solution of 30 70 PEG monomethacrylate PEG diacrylate is formulated with 1 wt photoinitiator. Following this 200 L of this PEG solution is then placed on an untreated silicon wafer and the patterned PFPE mold placed on top of it. The substrate is then placed on a flat substrate and a small pressure is applied to push out excess PEG solution. The entire apparatus is then subjected to UV light 365 nm for ten minutes while under a nitrogen purge. PEG particles connected by a PEG film will be observed after separation of the PFPE mold and the silicon wafer using scanning electron microscopy. Dragging a blade across the surface yields a rolled up film as shown in .

Particles on a cyanoacrylate film A patterned perfluoropolyether PFPE mold is generated by pouring a PFPE dimethacrylate PFPE DMA containing 2 2 diethoxyacetophenone over a silicon substrate patterned with 200 nm cylindrical shapes. The apparatus is then subjected to a nitrogen purge for 10 minutes before the application of UV light 365 nm for 10 minutes while under a nitrogen purge. The fully cured PFPE DMA mold is then released from the silicon master. Separately a poly ethylene glycol PEG diacrylate n 9 is blended with 28 wt PEG methacrylate n 9 2 wt azobisisobutyronitrile AIBN and 0.25 wt rhodamine methacrylate. Flat uniform non wetting surfaces are generated by coating a glass slide with PFPE dimethacrylate PFPE DMA containing 2 2 diethoxyacetophenone. The slide is then subjected to a nitrogen purge for 10 minutes then UV light is applied 365 nm while under a nitrogen purge. The flat fully cured PFPE DMA substrate is released from the slide. Following this 0.1 mL of the monomer blend is evenly spotted onto the flat PFPE DMA surface and then the patterned PFPE DMA mold placed on top of it. The surface and mold are then placed in a molding apparatus and a small amount of pressure is applied to remove any excess monomer solution. The entire apparatus is purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes then subjected to UV light 365 nm for 10 minutes while under a nitrogen purge. Neutral PEG nanoparticles are observed after separation of the PFPE DMA mold and substrate using scanning electron microscopy SEM . A thin layer of cyanoacrylate monomer is sprayed onto the PFPE DMA mold filled with particles. The PFPE DMA mold is immediately placed onto a glass slide and the cyanoacrylate is allowed to polymerize in an anionic fashion for one minute. The mold is removed and the particles are embedded in the adhesive layer see .

The PRINT process inherently introduces structural features from the silicon masters that are transferred to the mold and subsequently to the particles during PRINT fabrication. Here a Bosch type etch is used to process a master which introduces a recognizable pattern Bosch etch lines on the sidewalls of individual particles. Bosch etching is one of many techniques used to fabricate wafers most of which leave residual defects on the sidewalls of the features or surface. shows distinct particles derived from the masters that show a similar sidewall pattern resulting from the specific Bosch type etch process used on the master. In this case this pattern can be recognized using SEM imaging and identifies these particles as originating from the same master.

A patterned perfluoropolyether PFPE mold is generated by pouring a PFPE dimethacrylate PFPE DMA containing 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone over a silicon substrate patterned with 3 m cubical shapes at a 1 m depth. The substrate is then subjected to a nitrogen purge for 10 minutes then UV light 365 nm is applied for 10 minutes while under a nitrogen purge. The fully cured PFPE DMA mold is then released from the silicon master. A PFPE DMA mold is made from a master patterned with 2 m deep cubical shapes Separately TMPTA is blended with 1 wt of a photoinitiator 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone.

The entire apparatus is then purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes then subjected to UV light 365 nm for 10 minutes while under a nitrogen purge. TMPTA particles are observed after separation of the PFPE DMA mold and substrate using optical microscopy. A drop of n vinyl 2 pyrrolidone containing 5 photoinitiator 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone is placed on a clean glass slide. The PFPE DMA mold containing particles is placed patterned side down on the n vinyl 2 pyrrolidone drop. The slide is subjected to a nitrogen purge for 5 minutes then UV light 365 nm is applied for 5 minutes while under a nitrogen purge. The slide is removed and the mold is peeled away from the polyvinyl pyrrolidone and particles. Particles on the polyvinyl pyrrolidone were observed with optical microscopy. The polyvinyl pyrrolidone film containing particles was dissolved in water. Dialysis was used to remove the polyvinyl pyrrolidone leaving an aqueous solution containing TMPTA particles. Samples dispersions from the 1 m and 2 m deep master are dropped on an SEM stub and the water allowed to evaporate in a vacuum oven. The particles were coated with 10 gold palladium and imaged with SEM .
