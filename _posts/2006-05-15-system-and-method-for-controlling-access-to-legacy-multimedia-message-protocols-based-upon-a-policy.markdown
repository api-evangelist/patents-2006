The current invention relates generally to managing telecommunications and more particularly to a mechanism for controlling access to legacy multimedia message protocols based upon a policy.

Conventionally telecommunications and network infrastructure providers have relied on often decades old switching technology to providing routing for network traffic. Businesses and consumers however are driving industry transformation by demanding new converged voice data and video services. The ability to meet these demands often can be limited by existing IT and network infrastructures that are closed proprietary and too rigid to support these next generation services. As a result telecommunications companies are transitioning from traditional circuit switched Public Switched Telephone Networks PSTN the common wired telephone system used around the world to connect any one telephone to another telephone to Voice Over Internet Protocol VoIP networks. VoIP technologies enable voice communication over vanilla IP networks such as the public Internet. Additionally a steady decline in voice revenues has resulted in heightened competitive pressures as carriers vie to grow data service revenues and reduce chum through the delivery of these more sophisticated data services. Increased federal regulation security and privacy issues as well as newly emerging standards can further compound the pressure.

However delivering these more sophisticated data services has proved to be more difficult than first imagined. Existing IT and network infrastructures closed proprietary network based switching fabrics and the like have proved to be too complex and too rigid to allow the creation and deployment of new service offerings.

The invention is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. References to embodiments in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment and such references mean at least one.

The SIP server provides the communications platform with a subsystem in which application components that interact with SIP based networks may be deployed. The network gatekeeper provides a policy driven telecommunications Web services gateway that allows granular control over access to network resources from un trusted domains.

A variety of shared and re usable software and service infrastructure components comprise the communications platform . For example an application server such as the WebLogic Application Server by BEA Systems Inc. of San Jose Calif. This application server may be augmented and adapted for deployment in telecommunications networks while providing many features and functionality of the WebLogic Server counterpart widely deployed in enterprise computing environments. Application server embodiments for use in the telecommunications applications can provide a variety of additional features and functionality such as without limitation 

Analogously communications platform embodiments can provide a variety of additional features and functionality such as without limitation 

Communications platform comprises a Session Initiation Protocol SIP Server WLSS and a Network Gatekeeper WLNG . Tools for interacting with Web Services such as a Web Service Universal Description Discovery Interface WS UDDI a Web Service Business Process Execution Language WS BPEL may be coupled to the SIP Server and the Network Gatekeeper in embodiments. A log trace and database can assist with troubleshooting. In some deployments the communications platform can interface with processes that monitor underlying network function such as Operations Support Systems Business Support Systems OSS BSS system via RA protocol adapters . RA protocol is a protocol for submission of billing information that are maintained in the network gatekeeper and sent to a carrier s existing billing infrastructure. Embodiments can include one or more of the following services OSS BSS services. For example and without limitation Operations Support Systems services can include activation service assurance usage metering and provisioning including designing assigning and inventory. Business Support Systems can include billing including invoicing rating taxation and collections customer management including order entry customer self services customer care trouble ticketing and customer relationship management. Such interfaces can provide access to Operation Administration and Maintenance OAM applications and others. A policy engine controls access by one or more third party services not shown and services not shown to resource elements not shown in a network layer.

A Service Creation Environment SCE enables service providers to create applications using a higher level programming abstraction tool to expedite application creation. Other types of tools may be provided in embodiments to enable internal staff who are not necessarily software engineers e.g. business analysts IT MIS staff but are programmers or have programming skills e.g. internal software engineers with knowledge of the carrier s network etc. but perhaps less savvy as high power J2EE software engineers to be able to create or modify applications.

A communications platform embodiment can provide an open high performance software based fault tolerant platform that allows operators to maximize revenue potential by shortening time to market and significantly reducing per service implementation and integration cost and complexity. The communications platform is suitable for use by for network infrastructure vendors network operators and communications service providers in multiple deployment scenarios ranging from fully IP multi media subsystem IMS oriented network architectures to hybrid and highly heterogeneous network architectures. It is not restricted to use only in carrier networks however and may be deployed in Enterprise communications networks without restriction or extensive customization. When deployed in conjunction with an IP multimedia subsystem the communications platform can serve in the role of an IMS SIP application server and offers communications service providers an execution environment in which to host applications such as the WebLogic Network Gatekeeper components and standard service enablers. The following diagrams illustrate example network gatekeeper embodiments in telecommunications systems.

As illustrated by and by way of example an embodiment of a communications platform provides an easy to use integrated configuration driven intermediary between service providers third party service providers and end users . The communications platform embodiment illustrated by comprises an application layer with interfaces to applications of the service providers and third party service providers and a network layer to interface with the end users via one or more network resource elements . Communications platform further comprises a gatekeeper layer interposed between the application layer and the network layer for managing and controlling information flowing between layers and .

At the application layer third party service providers and service providers are provided protocol adapters to make services available to callers over a network via the gatekeeper layer provided by the communications platform . Access to network resource elements by services may be achieved using one or more web services protocol adapters . The protocol adapters provide an interface mechanism enabling the network gatekeeper to intercept protocol communications from services and control access to network resource elements by the services in accordance with one or more policies. While illustrated here with reference to an embodiment having adapters to specific protocols including without limitation a Short Message Peer to Peer protocol SMPP protocol adapter a Push Application Protocol PAP protocol adapter a Multimedia Messaging Services MM7 protocol adapter and an Internet Message Access Protocol IMAP protocol adapter embodiments may include any number or kind of protocols and are neither limited to nor required to possess these illustrated protocol adapters.

The gatekeeper layer includes a gatekeeper that comprises a plurality of functional elements working in concert to control access to network resource elements at the network layer by services according to one or more policies. In an embodiment a service level agreement SLA comprises one or more policies governing access to the network layer . A policy engine provides enforcement of the service level agreements. Service level agreements specify e.g. how many messages customer A sends an hour and if over a contract limit customer A starts paying more and so forth. In one embodiment capabilities to create customize and execute service level agreement provisions as policies are provided. A charging mechanism determines charges to callers for making a call using network resource elements e.g. determine charges for network traffic i.e. calls according to charging information payment amount schedule priorities and the like. Charging mechanism may access data including Call Data Records CDR and or Event Data Records EDR in order to determine charges. In one embodiment the charging mechanism determines an allocation of charges to be apportioned to the third party providing the service. As shown by the dotted lines in the actions of the policy engine and other functional elements of the gatekeeper provide virtual isolation layers between services at the application layer and network resource elements at the network layer . The isolation layers indicate that the gatekeeper layer functional elements can be isolated from and unaffected by the particulars of protocols interfaces and the like used by applications services and callers communicating using the network via the gatekeeper .

The gatekeeper layer may include one or more resource interfaces to interface with legacy protocols or other web services protocols as a mechanism to reach callers and end user applications clients via the network layer . While illustrated here with reference having resource interfaces to specific protocols including without limitation an SMPP protocol adapter a PAP protocol adapter an MM7 protocol adapter and an IMAP protocol adapter embodiments may include any number or kind of protocols and are neither limited to nor required to possess these illustrated resource interfaces. An extension toolkit not shown enables partners to develop resource interfaces for other protocols to include into the gatekeeper layer .

Network layer includes one or more resource elements such as without limitation a Parlay protocol gateway an IMS IP multi media subsystem an SMSCs short message service center and MMSCs multi media messaging service center each of which provides a mechanism for moving information through the network to one or more end user services .

A network gatekeeper controls access through the telecommunications system by applying at least one policy to the invocation block . The at least one policy indicates whether the legacy application is permitted to use a resource of the telecommunications system. By way of example and without limitation this can include controlling access through the telecommunications system with a policy engine at a gatekeeper by applying at least one policy in accordance with a service level agreement SLA to the invocation.

A resource interface connecting the gatekeeper with at least one resource element implementing the legacy push message protocol is provided the at least one invocation to a legacy push message protocol when the gatekeeper permits the legacy application to use a resource of the telecommunications system block . In embodiments this can include receiving the at least one invocation to a legacy push protocol at a resource interface plug in connecting the gatekeeper with at least one resource element implementing the legacy push application protocol PAP when the gatekeeper permits the legacy application to use a resource of the telecommunications system for example.

In accordance with an embodiment a service capability Policy Enforcement Point PEP is provided to receive at least one of a plurality of service requests from at least one application including at least one of a plurality of service capability modules to request a network plug in from the plug in manager to handle the request. A Policy Decision Point PDP is provided that selects from a plurality of different service level agreements a service level agreement to control network traffic based upon at least one temporal condition to control at least one of access to network resources and traffic flow coordination based upon the selected service level agreement. A plug in manager receives a decision from the PDP and provides at least one plug in representing a network resource element to route requests permitted by the PDP.

In accordance with an embodiment in an example of network level policy execution an application sends 1 a service request to the Gatekeeper which is processed at the service capability level. The service capability module requests 2 a network plug in from the plug in manager to handle the request. The plug in manager retrieves 3 a list of possible plug ins based on the address plan and destination address indicated in the service request. The plug in manager sends 4 the list of possible plug ins and the service request data to the policy engine for a policy decision. The policy engine makes a decision based on the request data general network gatekeeping rules specific data in the service provider traffic SLA specific data in the total traffic SLA and additional data provided by external databases or by the network node. The policy engine returns 5 a list of the plug ins that have passed the policy decision. The plug in manager is also informed if no plug in has passed. The plug in manager selects 6 a plug in from the list and sends it to the service capability module. The service capability module routes 7 the service request to the selected plug in.

The response and result notification is used by the push proxy gateway to inform the push initiator of the final outcome of a push submission if requested by the push initiator . This notification tells the push initiator that the message was sent delivered confirmation received from wireless device expired cancelled or there was an error. If there was a processing error the notification can be sent immediately upon detection of the error to the push initiator and the message should not be sent to the client. Otherwise the notification will be sent after the message delivery process has been completed. The delivery process is considered completed when the message is no longer a candidate for delivery e.g. the message has expired. If the push submission is indicated as rejected then no result notification will be sent.

Gatekeeper embodiments can provide Quality of Service SLAs Policy enforcement traffic throttling Service Provider Application authentication and others. Embodiments can ensure that carrier network elements are used in the most optimal and controlled manner when Push messages are submitted to a push proxy gateway.

The gatekeeper embodiments can provide Quality of Service SLAs Policy enforcement traffic throttling Service Provider Application authentication and others. Embodiments can ensure that carrier network elements are used in the most optimal and controlled manner when multimedia messages are sent to the MMSC.

If a short message is too long to fit inside one SUBMIT SM operation at the client on which the application resides the SMPP Client will split the message and send it using multiple SUBMIT SM operations. The SMPP interface will collect the multiple SUBMIT SM operations and turn them into one sendSMS call towards ESPA module . Later when a processNotification call is made by ESPA module to indicate that the message was delivered the SMPP interface will send multiple DELIVER SM operations to the SMPP Client i.e. multiple delivery receipts. This is when there were multiple messages that were sent.

Applications such as WAP Proxy Client VMS and Paging Bureau will interface directly with the gatekeeper. The gatekeeper embodiments can provide Quality of Service SLAs Policy enforcement traffic throttling Service Provider Application authentication and others.

Basic features. These include standards services such as Voice mail Caller ID Call waiting and call forwarding the ability to forward a call to a different number .

Advanced features. The list of advanced features is operators specific. Following is a brief list of advanced features 

Call logs The ability to view calls made over a given period of time online ability to associate names with phone numbers integrate call log information to other applications such as IM.

Do not disturb The ability to specify policies around receiving calls for example all calls during office hours to be automatically forwarded to a mobile terminal all calls during the night to be directed to voice mail etc.

Locate me This is advanced call forwarding. Rather than have all calls forwarded to a single location e.g. voice mail when the caller is busy Locate me can try multiple terminals in series or in parallel. For example a user may have two office locations a mobile and a pager and it may make sense to forward a call to both office locations first then the pager and then the mobile terminal. Locate me is another example of feature interaction.

Personal conferencing A user could use an existing application e.g. IM client to schedule a Web audio conference to start at a certain time. Since the IM client already has personal profile information the conferencing system sends out the Web conference link information either through IM and or email to the participants. The phone contact information in the profile is used to automatically ring the participants at the time of the conference.

Lifetime number This is the facility where a single virtual number can travel with a customer wherever they live. Even if they move the old number continues to work and reaches them at their new location. This is really the analog of static IP addresses in a phone network.

Speed dial This is the ability to dramatically expand the list of numbers that can be dialed through short key and accelerator combinations. This is another example of a converged application since it s very likely that when a user will set up this information when they work through the call logs on the operator user portal and the updated information needs to be propagated to the network side in real time.

Depending on the service level agreement users are willing to sign up to the quality of media delivered e.g. of frames per second will vary. The policy engine enables segmenting the customer base by revenue potential and to maximize return on investment made in the network.

A typical example here is the need for applications that have a short lifetime extremely high usage peaks within their lifetime and immediacy. For example voting on American Idol during the show or immediately afterwards has proved to be an extremely popular application.

The final class of applications is one that combines wireline and wireless terminal usage scenarios. An example of an integrated application is the following a mobile terminal user is on a conference call on their way to work. When he reaches his office he enters a special key sequence to transfer the phone call to his office phone. The transfer happens automatically without the user having to dial in the dial in information again. It s important to note hear that this capability be available without the use of any specific support from the hand set a transfer button for example .
