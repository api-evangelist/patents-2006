This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application 60 595 696 filed on Jul. 28 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to supersonic fluid flow and in particular to the turning of supersonic fluid flow.

As a general matter the turning or diverting of supersonic flow is a difficult process. Some turning devices do not take into account the complexities of compressible supersonic flow and how to manage and or mitigate the same. Accordingly they merely utilize a subsonic type turning device in a location that may not be designed to cleanly and efficiently turn or redirect the supersonic flow. As a result such devices may create shocks ubiquitously in numerous locations and establish a pulsating flow.

It is an object of the invention to provide a supersonic turning vane that effectively decelerates supersonic fluid flow to subsonic speed prior to turning the flow.

It is a further object of the invention to provide a supersonic turning vane that is simple in construction.

Still another object of the invention is to exploit the use of expansions shocks and converging diverging nozzle aspects to turn supersonic flow.

One aspect of the invention is a turning vane disposed adjacent a supersonic flow passage the turning vane comprising a suction side and a pressure side the suction side including an expansion turning wall the expansion turning wall comprising an angled portion and a substantially straight portion wherein the expansion turning wall creates an expansion fan that projects into the supersonic flow passage to turn supersonic flow into the turning vane the pressure side comprising a large radius curved surface the pressure side and the suction side converging to form a throat wherein a shock is formed upstream of the throat the separation induced shock decelerating the supersonic flow to subsonic conditions and the pressure side turning the subsonic flow the suction side including an outer nozzle expansion wall downstream of the throat the outer nozzle expansion wall diverging from the pressure side to form an expansion nozzle that expands the subsonic flow to supersonic conditions.

Another aspect of the invention is a turning vane disposed adjacent a supersonic flow passage having a wall the turning vane comprising a suction side and a pressure side wherein profiles of the suction side and the pressure side are defined using a rectangular coordinate system having an origin at an intersection of the pressure side and the wall the profile of the pressure side defined by points through having substantially the coordinates of points through in and the profile of the suction side defined by points having substantially the coordinates of points in .

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The present invention effectively decelerates supersonic fluid flow to subsonic speeds so that the flow may be efficiently turned. The downstream flow path includes an expanding passage that accelerates the high stagnation pressure flow to supersonic conditions prior to exit. The shape of the inventive turning vane creates strategically located expansion fans and shocks. The expansion fans and shocks permit the effective deceleration of the flow for efficient subsonic turning. The turning vane is optimized to utilize the expansion and compression waves that occur when supersonic flow is diverted from the centerline of the flow passage. The invention is applicable to muzzle brakes for small and large caliber munitions turbo machinery and or other similar devices and applications.

Turning vane includes a suction side and a pressure side . The suction side includes an expansion turning wall comprising an angled portion and a substantially straight portion . The expansion turning wall creates an expansion fan shown in dashed lines that projects into the supersonic flow passage to turn supersonic flow into the turning vane . The pressure side comprises a large radius of curvature relative to the chord length or passage hydraulic diameter.

The pressure side and the suction side converge to form a throat . The throat is the area of minimum cross section. A shock shown in dashed lines is formed upstream of the throat . The shock decelerates the supersonic flow to subsonic speed. The pressure side turns the subsonic flow. The suction side includes an outer nozzle expansion wall downstream of the throat . The outer nozzle expansion wall diverges from the pressure side to form an expansion nozzle that expands the subsonic flow to supersonic speed.

In the three dimensional turning vane a plurality of support members not shown connect the suction side to the pressure side to support the vane. The support members are disposed circumferentially around centerline C in a known manner. The turning vane has a thickness T.

At angled portion the wall makes a relatively sharp turn and continues as a substantially straight section . The angled portion and the substantially straight section form the expansion turning wall on the suction side of the vane . The expansion turning wall creates the expansion fan . Expansion fan projects into the center core flow of the flow passage . The expansion fan efficiently turns a portion of the supersonic flow X into the vane .

Slightly down the suction side a shock is formed due to separation in the area of point along the suction side . The location of shock is influenced by the angle of expansion wall the change in radius at point and the width of throat . The shock decelerates the supersonic flow which has been diverted by the expansion fan to subsonic speeds. The subsonic flow is then turned by the pressure side of the vane . The majority of the turning of the flow occurs at the pressure side . Because the flow is subsonic at the pressure side the turning is very efficient. The throat controls flow through the vane .

After the flow is turned it is expanded in expansion nozzle to supersonic speed. The pressure side and the outer nozzle expansion wall define nozzle . In nozzle the pressure is reduced and additional thrust is produced. The design of vane produces a relatively uniform mass flux throughout the vane. Thus a small vane thickness T is able to achieve a high turning angle.

In points define the pressure side . In points define the suction side . The X Y coordinates for each point are given in . The inventive turning vane has a shape such that the coordinates of its points correspond substantially to the coordinates in . Variations from the coordinates shown in are allowable as long as the turning vane functions as described above. are enlarged views of the pressure and suctions sides respectively.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
