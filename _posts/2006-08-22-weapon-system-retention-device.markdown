This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application 60 595 974 filed on Aug. 22 2005 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to weapon systems and in particular to a retention device for positioning propellant and or ammunition in guns.

The problem of how to hold munitions in an open cannon chamber has existed for as long as cannons have been used. A common method is to de elevate the cannon to a horizontal position between firings. This method drastically reduces the number of rounds fired per minute because of the time needed to reposition the cannon for firing. Another method used to hold propellant in an elevated chamber is the Swiss notch. The Swiss notch is basically a notch cut into the chamber of the cannon at the six o clock position. The notch is designed so that propellant bags or charge modules will catch on the notch if they begin to fall out of the chamber due to gravity. The Swiss notch is only somewhat effective because it is totally dependent on the drop angle weight and profile of the propellant bag or module to fall uncontrolled into the notch. At higher angles the propellant bag or module may not fall into the notch. In addition experience has shown that the Swiss notch is not a foolproof method to keep the propellant bag or charge modules from falling out of the chamber at any elevated angle. Further the combustion debris may fill the notch and render it useless.

In a breech loaded cannon it is most efficient to load propellant bags or charge modules using a device such as an automatic loader. Typically the propellant bags or modules are loaded with the cannon muzzle at an elevated angle. However upon withdrawal of the auto loader ram the propellant can fall out of the chamber due to the elevated muzzle.

It is an object of the invention to provide a device to hold propellant inside a firing chamber until the breech is closed.

It is another object of the invention to provide a device to hold propellant inside a firing chamber without having to lower the muzzle load the cannon and then reposition the muzzle.

It is a further object of the invention to provide a device to hold propellant inside a firing chamber wherein the device operates automatically.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus for retaining an object in a gun tube of a weapon system the gun tube having a longitudinal axis a chamber and a breech ring with an opening therein the apparatus comprising a plunger that reciprocates in the opening in the breech ring and the chamber a housing fixed in the opening in the breech ring the housing holding the plunger and means for reciprocating the plunger in the opening in the breech ring and the chamber.

In one embodiment the weapon system includes a non recoil surface and the means for reciprocating the plunger includes a compression spring disposed around the plunger and a solenoid fixed to the non recoil surface such that when activated the solenoid is operable to move the plunger into the chamber and when deactivated the compression spring moves the plunger out of the chamber.

In a second embodiment the weapon system includes a breech crankshaft and the means for reciprocating the plunger includes a drive gear attached to the breech crankshaft a fixed shaft having a driven gear mounted thereon that meshes with the drive gear a cam mounted on the fixed shaft and including a cam path and a cam follower fixed to the plunger and operable to follow the cam path of the cam.

In a third embodiment the weapon system includes a breech crankshaft and the means for reciprocating the plunger includes a cam mounted on the breech crankshaft and including a cam path a cam lever having one end rotatably attached to the housing and another end with an opening formed therein a first cam follower fixed to the plunger and disposed in the opening in the cam lever and a second cam follower mounted on the cam lever and operable to follow the cam path of the cam.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of retaining an object in a gun tube of a weapon system the gun tube having a longitudinal axis a chamber and a breech ring with an opening therein the method comprising placing the object in the gun tube and moving a plunger through the opening in the breech ring and into the chamber such that a portion of the plunger contacts a rear surface of the object.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention holds propellant bags or propellant modules inside the firing chamber of a gun until the breech is closed. The cannon is loaded at an elevated muzzle angle without having to lower the muzzle load the cannon and reposition the muzzle. Because some loading steps are eliminated the invention is faster and safer than known methods. A paddle like retaining device is introduced at the firing chamber entrance to hold the propellant in place. The retaining device may be mechanically electrically and or hydraulically inserted into the firing chamber.

In some embodiments the retaining device is activated during the mechanical action of opening and closing the breech by using an electrically operated solenoid hydraulic actuator or cam action. During firing the retaining device is in the retracted position away from the chamber opening. After firing the breech is opened and the projectile and propellant modules are loaded into the chamber for the next round. When the propellant modules have been placed into the firing chamber the load ram is extracted and the retaining device is actuated. The retaining device may extend through a port in the breech ring and thence into the chamber access area to hold the propellant in place. The retaining device may be actuated in various ways.

In the object to be retained or positioned in the gun tube is typically propellant such as a bag or charge module. To effectively retain the object in the tube against the force of gravity the end of the plunger that contacts the object may include an increased area portion as shown in . The increased area portion contacts the rear end of the object and prevents the object from sliding rearward to the breech of the gun tube .

The weapon system includes a non recoil surface . In the embodiment of the means for reciprocating the plunger includes a compression spring disposed around the plunger and a solenoid fixed to the non recoil surface . When activated as in the solenoid is operable to move the plunger into the gun chamber . When deactivated as in the compression spring moves the plunger out of the gun chamber . The weapon system includes a fire control system shown schematically in as a box. The fire control system is connected to the solenoid via wire for activating and deactivating the solenoid .

The solenoid is actuated after the propellant is loaded into the gun tube causing the plunger to extend into the breech chamber behind the propellant thereby holding the propellant in place. Just prior to full closure of the breech the solenoid is deactivated and the plunger is retracted. Plunger remains retracted until the weapon system has fired the breech is reopened and a new charge is loaded into the gun tube. As best seen in a vertical plane V through tube intersects a longitudinal axis A of plunger forming an angle alpha. In one embodiment it is preferred that alpha is about thirty eight degrees. Of course other angles may be used.

As best seen in apparatus includes an indicator tab inserted in a hole in plunger . Indicator tab moves up and down in slot of housing with plunger . Thus indicator tab may be used as a check on the position of plunger . For example indicator tab may comprise a magnetic material and a magnetic sensor may be mounted adjacent housing to sense the position of indicator tab . The magnetic sensor may be connected to the fire control system such that an incorrect position of plunger stops the operation of weapon system .

Weapon system includes a breech crankshaft not shown that fits through lug . The means for reciprocating the plunger includes a drive gear attached to the breech crankshaft a driven gear that meshes with and is driven by the drive gear the driven gear being rotatably mounted on a fixed shaft a cam mounted on the fixed shaft and including a cam path and a cam follower fixed to the plunger and operable to follow the cam path of the cam . As shown in the cam comprises a generally conical shape and includes the cam path on an external surface thereof.

Weapon system includes a breech crankshaft that fits through breech ring lugs . The means for reciprocating the plunger includes a cam mounted on the breech crankshaft and rotated by the carrier not shown . Cam is generally disc shaped and includes a cam path formed on one side. A cam lever has one end rotatably attached to the housing using cam lever shaft . Torsion spring provides a biasing force to the cam lever .

The other end of cam lever includes an opening therein. Cam follower is fixed to the plunger with cam shaft . Cam follower rides in opening in cam lever and moves the plunger up and down as the cam lever rotates about cam lever shaft . Cam follower is connected to the cam lever with cam shaft and rides in cam path . As shown in an angle delta between the longitudinal axis S of the plunger and an axis of rotation T of the breech crankshaft is about ninety degrees.

Further details of the assembly of apparatus are seen in . Plunger comprises a split rod with an upper portion and a lower portion . Housing cover plate confines plunger in housing . A steel plug functions as a target for proximity sensors not shown that are placed in the top and bottom of the housing cover plate . As the upper portion of the plunger moves up and down the proximity sensors not shown in the housing cover plate sense the presence or absence of the steel plug and thereby provide an indication of the location of plunger that is activated or deactivated . Cam lever shaft is provided with a bushing and spring pin . A housing plate washer and bolts are used to attach housing cover plate to housing . Cam followers ride on cam follower shafts .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
