The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to mortar munitions and in particular to breech loaded mortar munitions.

In the past mortars have been muzzle loaded. With muzzle loaded mortars the position of the mortar bomb in the mortar tube is not an issue. In a breech loaded mortar a mechanical auto loader pushes the mortar bombs into the mortar tube through the open breech end. In general it is desirable that the auto loader push the mortar bomb a bit further down the tube than the final firing position of the bomb. This allows the breech to be closed without fear of striking the bomb. After closing the breech the mortar bomb must be moved rearward in the tube to its correct firing position. Thus a device is needed to move the bombs rearward from their loaded position to their firing position.

Another problem occurs when the mortar tube is in an elevated position i.e. not horizontal . At high elevations the mortar bomb may fall out of the breech during retraction of the auto loader. Then the breech block will strike the bomb when the breech is closed. U.S. Pat. No. 7 040 211 issued on May 9 2006 discloses a mortar bomb retention apparatus and is incorporated by reference herein. That apparatus can prevent the mortar bomb from falling out of the breech when the mortar tube is in an elevated position. However that apparatus is not able to retract a mortar bomb that was positioned or has moved too far down the tube when the mortar tube is at horizontal or near horizontal elevation. Therefore there is a need for an apparatus to work in unison with the mortar bomb retention apparatus to properly position the mortar bomb in the tube.

A primary object of the invention is to provide an apparatus to properly position a breech loaded mortar bomb in the mortar tube.

Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus that prevents the mortar bomb from falling out of the breech when the mortar tube is in an elevated position and also retracts the mortar bomb that has been loaded too far down the tube away from the breech end.

One aspect of the invention is a mortar munition comprising a mortar tube first and second openings in the wall of the mortar tube the first opening being closer to a breech end of the mortar tube than the second opening a spring loaded valve assembly disposed in the first opening in the wall of the mortar tube and a shoe assembly disposed in the second opening in the wall of the mortar tube. A vacuum source is connected to the spring loaded valve assembly.

The mortar munition further comprises a first solenoid having a plunger the plunger being disposed to open the spring loaded valve assembly. The first solenoid is attached to a first recoilless mass. A fire control computer is electrically connected to the first solenoid.

The spring loaded valve assembly comprises a valve disposed in a housing the housing being disposed in the opening in the wall of the mortar tube a valve cap on one end of the valve the valve cap for interacting with the solenoid plunger and a compression spring disposed around the valve for keeping the valve normally closed. A vacuum connection is rotatably attached to the housing.

The shoe assembly comprises a lever arm a lever positioner in which the lever arm is rotatably mounted a generally cylindrical housing having a central opening therethrough the central opening comprising a large diameter portion and a small diameter portion the lever positioner being fixed to the housing a shoe disposed in the central opening in the housing a compression spring disposed around the shoe in the large diameter portion of the central opening and a shoe cap attached to an end of the shoe one end of the compression spring bearing against the shoe cap a portion of the lever arm contacting the shoe cap wherein rotation of the lever arm is operable to force the shoe downward.

The mortar munition further comprises a second solenoid having a plunger wherein the plunger is operable to rotate the lever arm. The second solenoid is attached to a second recoilless mass. The fire control computer is electrically connected to the second solenoid.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Referring now to one embodiment of a mortar munition in accordance with the invention comprises a mortar tube having a wall with first and second openings therein. The first opening is closer to the breech end of the mortar tube than the second opening . A spring loaded valve assembly is disposed in the first opening and a shoe assembly is disposed in the second opening . A first solenoid includes a plunger that interacts with the spring loaded valve assembly . A vacuum source is connected to the spring loaded valve assembly via vacuum line . The first solenoid is attached to a first recoilless mass . A fire control computer is electrically connected to the first solenoid . A second solenoid includes a plunger that interacts with the shoe assembly . The second solenoid is attached to a second recoilless mass . Depending on the particular munition first and second recoilless masses may be the same or different masses.

Referring to the spring loaded valve assembly comprises a valve disposed in a housing . The housing is disposed in the opening in the wall of the mortar tube . One end of the valve includes a valve cap that interacts with the solenoid plunger . A compression spring is disposed around the valve for keeping the valve normally closed. A vacuum connection is attached to the housing . The vacuum connection is preferably rotatable around the housing . To this end O rings seal the vacuum connection to the housing . The rotatable vacuum connection is desirable so that the vacuum line may be connected to the assembly in any orientation.

The central opening includes a step located between the large and small diameter portions . One end of the compression spring bears against the step and another end of the compression spring bears against shoe cap . A lower portion of the lever arm is in contact with the shoe cap . shows lever arm in the upright position and shoe in the retracted position inside housing . When the lever arm is rotated in the direction shown by arrow A in the shoe moves downward as shown by arrow B. When the force moving lever arm is removed compression spring moves lever back to its upright position and shoe is retracted back into housing .

Referring also to second solenoid includes a plunger that contacts lever arm and is operable to rotate lever arm . In rotation of lever arm is counter clockwise around pin . Lever arm typically rotates for example twenty degrees. Mortar tube includes second opening in its wall into which housing is disposed. Housing may be provided with external threads that engage internal threads in the opening . Housing is mounted so that the end of the housing is flush with the interior surface of tube .

The invention operates in two primary modes depending on the elevation of the mortar tube . One mode of operation is with the mortar tube horizontal zero elevation or nearly horizontal and the other mode of operation is with the mortar tube elevated. With the mortar tube at zero elevation a breech loaded mortar bomb may thrown down the tube out of firing position by an auto loader or operating personnel. To prevent this the fire control computer operates the solenoid in a pulse mode. In the pulse mode the fire control computer sends a rapid series of on and off signals to solenoid that causes the shoe to alternately extend into and retract from the mortar tube . The alternating contact with the shoe slows down the travel of the breech loaded mortar bomb and prevents it from traveling too far down the tube. Prior to firing the mortar bomb the pulse mode is disabled and the shoe is completely retracted from the tube .

To ensure that the breech does not strike the bomb when the breech is closed the position of the bomb is positioned forward of the correct firing position. When the fire control computer senses that the breech is closed a signal is sent to solenoid and plunger pushes on valve cap to open valve . When valve is open vacuum source is fluidly connected to the space behind the maximum diameter portion of mortar bomb thereby pulling the bomb rearward to its correct firing position. The correct firing position is shown in . Plunger then retracts and compression spring forces valve to the normally closed position. The mortar munition may then be fired. During recoil the plunger is not in contact with the valve cap so that the assembly is free to recoil with the tube .

When the mortar tube is used in an elevated position it is necessary to hold the mortar bomb in the tube away from the breech while the breech is being closed. With the mortar tube elevated the bomb is breech loaded The shoe is in the inactive retracted position. to a point in the tube forward of the firing position. Once the bomb is in that position the computer activates the shoe thereby holding the bomb in place. The breech is then able to close without the bomb falling back out of the breech. Once the breech is closed the shoe is retracted and gravity allows the bomb to fall against the breech into the firing position.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
