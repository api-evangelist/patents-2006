This application is related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 461 088 titled Scroll Mechanism and Keyboard having Jeffrey Hawkins as named inventor and filed on the same day as the present application.

The present invention generally relates to a navigation mechanism and more particularly to a context driven navigation mechanism.

A scroll mechanism on computer peripheral device such as a computer mouse or trackball device is known. Likewise a scroll mechanism on a personal digital assistant for example the RIM BlackBerry or Good G100 device is known. In each instance the scroll mechanism provides a navigation aid that is physically apart from the keyboard input mechanism. One reason for such a configuration in these devices is because the operation and use of the keyboard is functionally separate and distinct from how the scroll wheel is used and applied in that typically the two mechanisms do not operate closely together.

To the extent an input mechanism does closely interact with the keyboard it is typically a trackpad or trackball device. Such a device often present on laptop computers and in some keyboard units is a convenient navigation aid for a user. However the device is a complex device that requires additional surface area. This additional area increases the size of the overall device on which it resides. This increase in area requires additional manufacturing materials that increases product cost and creates a bulkier less convenient device for use by an end user.

An aspect of an embodiment of the present invention includes a data entry interface. The data entry interfaces includes a full size keyboard and a navigation mechanism. The navigation mechanism is structured to be below the keyboard.

The full size keyboard which can be a QWERTY keyboard or corresponding non United States full size keyboard such as an AZERTY keyboard to QWERTZ keyboard includes a plurality of keys arranged in a plurality of rows. The full size keyboard is configured so that a user s fingers can reside on a home row or typing position of the keys with a user s thumb on or near a space bar. It is noted that a home row corresponds to the A S D F and J K L or equivalent keys of the keyboard . In one embodiment the navigation mechanism is structured to be below the keyboard e.g. under a bottom row of a plurality of rows of the keyboard as further described herein.

The navigation mechanism includes a scroll wheel or cylinder or bar a first button a second button a third button optional and a fourth button optional . In one embodiment the first and the third button are on one side of the scroll wheel and the second and the fourth button are on the other side of the scroll wheel. It is noted that although the term scroll wheel is used it is intended to include other mechanisms rotatable about a fixed axis such as a roller.

The scroll wheel is structured to be rotatable about an axis. The scroll wheel has wheel surface a portion of the wheel surface exposed at the data entry interface and a portion of the wheel surface beneath the data entry interface. The wheel surface configured to move in a first direction and a second direction each direction having a corresponding movement in the same direction on a screen of a computing system.

The buttons to each side of the scroll beneficially provide additional functionality. By way of example the first selection button when depressed is configured to select an object on the screen of the computing system. Further by way of example second selection button when depressed is configured to display a menu on the screen of the computing system. The third selection button when depressed is configured to initiate a first predefined function on the screen of the computing system and the fourth selection button when depressed is configured to initiate a second predefined function on the screen of the computing system. Examples of the first predefined function include moving a cursor to a beginning of a line moving a cursor to a beginning of a page or displaying a previous page. Examples of the second predefined function include moving a cursor to an end of a line moving a cursor to an end of the page or displaying a subsequent page.

With respect to the structure of the navigation mechanism in one embodiment the scroll wheel the first button and the second button are aligned horizontally under the keyboard. Further in one embodiment the configuration may have a length that is no greater than a length of a space bar key of the full size keyboard. In addition it may have a width that is no greater than a width of the spacebar key of the full size keyboard. In addition the placement of the navigation mechanism may be such that when the user interfaces with the full size keyboard in a conventional home position e.g. fingers along the A S D F and J K L keys of the QWERTY keyboard the scroll wheel is accessible and controllable with thumbs of a user without having to re position the hands.

Hence this aspect of an embodiment of the present invention provides a compact navigation mechanism for use with full size keyboards. The compact design allows for a smaller form factor input interface e.g. keyboard and navigation mechanism without loss of functionality or without compromising on the size of the input interface. Thus devices such as those having a form factor similar to a notebook or sub notebook can be made smaller. This can help reduce weight and size of such devices making them more appealing to user markets such as mobile travelers. Yet another aspect of an embodiment of the present invention includes navigation flexibility offered by the navigation mechanism and full size keyboard. For example the system can be configured to link modifier keys of the keyboard e.g. CNTL ALT or SHIFT with the navigation mechanism to allow for additional or enhanced functionality. This allows for more efficient navigation because a user is provided with greater screen and application navigation options without having to re position user hands relative to the keyboard.

Another aspect of an embodiment of the present invention includes a context driven configuration and operation. In particular a computing navigation mechanism includes a scroll wheel that is configured to direct movement on a computer screen in response to a context of interaction with an application visible as active on the computer screen. In one embodiment the scroll wheel is configured to include intra element scrolling and inter element scrolling.

Intra element scrolling includes moving content within a window of the application and for moving between items within a menu of the application. Intra element scrolling further comprises pane scrolling and selection scrolling. Pane scrolling comprises moving content in the first direction or the second direction within the window pane of an application in response to the content exceeding a size of the window pane of the application being active. Selection scrolling comprises incrementally selecting between items in a menu list in a menu of an application in response to the menu being active.

Inter element scrolling includes moving between enabled links in an application. Inter element scrolling includes item scrolling. By way of example item scrolling includes incrementally moving between links within an active web page that is rendered in a web browser application.

Thus a benefit this aspect of an embodiment of the present invention includes using a scroll mechanism to navigate within an application or window based on the context of that application or window. This increases navigation flexibility and usability by reducing the need for additional navigation commands within each application or window.

In addition unlike conventional navigation systems such as trackpads on notebook computers an embodiment of the present invention differs in a variety of aspects both structurally e.g. through use of a scroll mechanism integrated with a QWERTY keyboard layout and functionally e.g. through configurability of the scroll mechanism to interact with an application based on its context. For example use of a combination of a keyboard key and the scroll mechanism or scroll wheel as defined previously allows for navigation of all areas of the application. In turn this reduces the number of hand movements and position changes a user must make to accomplish common tasks. The reduced movement eases user fatigue and increases ease of use. By switching the exact action based on context the most common task is easily accessible using the scroll wheel and the next two most common tasks are available using the scroll wheel in conjunction with the modifier keys.

The expansion slot is configured to receive and support expansion cards or media cards that include memory cards such as CompactFlash cards SD cards XD cards Memory Sticks MultiMediaCard SDIO and the like. Further the screen navigation interface the stylus the microphone and the one or more control buttons can have various functions applied to them. Again it is noted that in a full size keyboard may be integrated as illustrated in

Turning to illustrated is one embodiment of a computing architecture of the handheld computing device in accordance with the present invention. The architecture includes a processor or CPU a storage device a memory an optional expansion or media port interface an optional graphics engine an optional audio processing engine a network interface and one or more other input output I O port interfaces . Each of the components of the computing architecture may be communicatively couple through a data bus .

In addition the architecture also includes an operating system that interfaces with the components of the computing architecture. For example the computing architecture may include a media control mechanism or panel that is configured to interact with the operating system . Likewise it may include one or more applications that are configured to communicate with the operating system . The media control mechanism and the applications are communicatively coupled for example through the operating system and the applications can access the media control mechanisms through an application programming interface. The media control mechanisms are configured to provide functional control relative to media applications as further described herein.

The processor can be a microprocessor or controller. In one embodiment the processor is an embedded application processor such as an Intel XScale processor. The storage device is a long term storage device for example a hard drive e.g. magnetic hard drive or a flash memory drive. The memory is a computing memory such as a random access memory RAM . The expansion port interface is configured to interface with a media card such as the ones previously described. The optional graphics engine may include hardware e.g. graphics chip in addition to software to enhance graphics for display on the screen .

The optional audio processing engine is configured for audio related processing such as recording and playback. The audio processing engine includes appropriate hardware e.g. microphone speaker and or ports or jacks and software e.g. sound controls to achieve such functionality. The network interface is configured for network connections to a wide range of networks and includes appropriate hardware and software to communicatively couple to such networks. Examples of networks that can be configured to function with the handheld computing device include personal area networks e.g. Bluetooth wireless networks e.g. IEEE 802.11 and or telecommunications networks e.g. cellular or data . The one or more other input output I O ports include interfaces for connections such as universal serial bus USB IEEE 1394 e.g. FireWire and the like.

In addition it is noted that the architecture of handheld computing device is configured to use a conventional operating system for example Palm OS from ACCESS Co. Ltd Tokyo Japan or Windows Mobile from Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. . It is noted that the device can also be configured for use with other operating systems for example Linux based operating systems. The operating system provides an interface for one or more applications for example an e mail calendar phone book web browser word processing and spreadsheet. In addition it provides an interface for control mechanisms to operate with the device for example peripheral devices that are in communication with the handheld computing device .

The peripheral device is a wireless device that as noted previously serves as a peripheral to handheld computing device . The peripheral device is structured to include a full sized input interface e.g. a keyboard and scroll area and a full sized display screen in a single device. A user interacts with data stored on the wireless communication device using the peripheral device as an input output device. The peripheral device accesses data residing on the wireless communication device and uses such data in executing applications. Documents files and other data resulting from execution of applications are stored on the wireless communication device.

The configuration of the devices can be such that the data the user interacts with can stay on the wireless device. Thus the user may interact with the device when the handheld computing device is either unavailable or dormant with the confidence that their work will be stored until such time as communication with the handheld is re established. The user does not need to manually transfer data back and forth synchronization operations are performed by software residing on the two devices either automatically or at the customers explicit initiation. The peripheral device is capable of operating with any wireless communication device adapted to establish a connection with the peripheral device . For ease of discussion and understanding the wireless communication device referenced will be the handheld computing device .

In one embodiment the peripheral device is structured to have an outward appearance resembling a conventional laptop type and more closely a sub notebook type computer including the screen and the keyboard connected by a hinge type structure . The peripheral device is capable of performing automatic configuration and wireless connection to the handheld computing device . In one embodiment whenever the user opens the peripheral the peripheral automatically turns itself on and attempts to establish a connection with the handheld computing device .

The peripheral device is connected to the handheld computing device using any communication technology that allows for data transmission between the peripheral device and the wireless communication device. In a preferred embodiment the peripheral device and the handheld computing device are connected using a wireless connection. In another embodiment the peripheral device connects with the handheld computing device through an electrical or optical cable interface. In yet another embodiment the peripheral device connects to the handheld computing device using a mechanical interface.

The peripheral device can be implemented according to various embodiments. In one embodiment the peripheral device functions as an input output peripheral for the handheld computing device . In this configuration applications run only on the handheld computing device and not on the peripheral device accordingly the peripheral device need not even include a processor. In another embodiment the peripheral device is capable of downloading applications residing on the handheld computing device and running them using a processor of the peripheral device . In yet another alternative embodiment the peripheral device is capable of storing applications and or data from one session to the next so as to minimize the amount of information to be transferred between the devices and to act as a backup mechanism for data stored on the handheld computing device . In an alternative embodiment an arrangement advantageously allows a user to restore data if the data is lost on the handheld computing device .

As previously mentioned the peripheral device may be implemented in a laptop like configuration including the screen and keyboard . Alternatively the peripheral device can be implemented as software running on a conventional computer system such as a laptop computer or desktop computer. In such an embodiment the peripheral device runs software that allows the device to function as a peripheral device for a handheld computing device .

The peripheral device uses the handheld computing device to connect to available networks such as the Internet. For example a user of the peripheral device makes use of a browser application for example NetFront Pocket Internet Explorer or other Internet browser to request web pages and interact with received web pages. The handheld computing device functions as an intermediary in passing requests for web pages and providing web pages to a user of the peripheral device . Depending on the particular embodiment as described herein the browser application may run on the handheld computing device or on the peripheral device itself.

Turning next to it illustrates an input interface for a peripheral device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In this configuration the input interface is illustrated as a full size keyboard which can we a QWERTY AZERTY QWERTZ or other similarly configured keyboard . In the illustrated embodiment a QWERTY type keyboard has a row of keys that are predominately number keys followed by three rows of keys that are predominately letter keys followed by a row of keys that are predominately control and special keys including the space bar. Below the keyboard is a horizontal structural arrangement for the scroll area . In one embodiment reference to below is with respect to positioning in an x y plane. For example if a home row e.g. A S D F and J K L keys of a QWERTY keyboard is along an x axis and at a y axis 0 or approximately 0 keys above e.g. Q W E R T Y are at a y direction and keys below e.g. Z X C V B or a spacebar are at a y direction.

Referring to it illustrates a closer view of an example the scroll area which is a context driven scroll mechanism for the peripheral device in accordance with one embodiment the present invention. As noted above the scroll area includes the scroll wheel which is flanked by buttons on each side . In one embodiment the buttons are similar to selection buttons associated with a mouse or trackpad mechanism. With the discussion of reference also will be made to through which illustrate front face and side views of a context driven scroll mechanism for a peripheral device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

In the illustrated embodiment the scroll wheel is configured so that it moves about an axis in a Y up or Y down direction in an x y z Cartesian coordinate system e.g. . In addition each button is a selection type button that moves in a Z up and Z down direction in an x y z Cartesian coordinate system e.g. in a force resistance configuration in . In one embodiment the selection type button may be structured as rectangular shaped pointing device type selection buttons. It should be well understood that other shapes e.g. squares trapezoids ovals etc. may be used for the buttons without detracting from its functionality.

The selection buttons may be pre configured to work in conjunction with a pointing device to act as conventional selection buttons. For example the conventional selection buttons may be configured to include a right click button to bring up a menu in an application and left click button to select an item in the menu or application. Alternatively it may be programmed by a user through a software mechanism a user interacts with on the device or it may be configured to automatically change functionality depending on the context of what is an active application on a screen as further described below.

Unlike conventional laptop type configurations each selection type button generally also has additional functional buttons generally immediately next to it on its outer side. In one embodiment additional functional buttons may be structured as circle shaped buttons that move in the Z or Z direction and may be surrounded by an outer ring that may help further distinguish its structure relative to the other buttons . It should be well understood that other shapes e.g. squares hexagons octagons etc. may be used for the buttons without detracting from its functionality.

The additional functional buttons may be pre configured for example go to a previously viewed page or skip to the next page in a viewing history while a user keeps hands in a conventional typing or ready position e.g. fingers on the home row keys e.g. A S D F J K L keys or equivalent or may be programmed by a user through a software mechanism a user interacts with on the device. Alternatively it may be configured to automatically change functionality depending on the context of what is an active application on a screen as further described below.

Turning back to It is noted that the scroll area is configured so that when a user places their fingers on the home row e.g. A S D F keys left hand fingers and J K L keys right hand fingers or equivalent a user s thumb or thumbs are positioned to be on or near the space bar. In this configuration a user s thumbs could comfortably reach space bar as well as the scroll area scroll wheel and or selection buttons and or functional buttons . Hence this configuration helps optimize usability of the scroll area and provides greater control for a user for functions performed through the input mechanisms e.g. scroll wheel buttons in the scroll area .

The configuration disclosed herein provides a compact navigation mechanism for use with full size keyboards. The compact design allows for a smaller form factor input interface e.g. keyboard and navigation mechanism without loss of functionality or without compromising on the size of the input interface. Thus devices such as those of a having a form factor similar to a notebook or sub notebook can be made smaller without reducing key size further. This can help reduce weight and size of such devices making them more appealing to user markets such as mobile travelers.

With respect to scrolling a typical use for scrolling includes pane scrolling moving the content window for content panes and fields. Selection scrolling includes maintaining a specific selection such as the List Stepper and Dropdown menu. Scrolling these with the scroll wheel will increment the selection within the list. The actual incremental movement can be predefined for example go through each item in a serial order or in a group order. As for item scrolling it includes link walking on a web page or moving the focus ring to sequential items in the focus queue within an application or dialog. In some embodiments item scrolling is similar to tabbing or shift tabbing.

In general in one embodiment the scroll wheel is configured for intra element scrolling and inter element change. Intra element scrolling includes pane scrolling and selection scrolling. Inter element change includes item scrolling. In some embodiments item scrolling may be accomplished via shift scrolling the scroll wheel e.g. press and hold SHIFT key and scroll on scroll wheel which may be beneficial if functional conflicts arise.

The scroll wheel also can be configured for page scrolling and horizontal scrolling. Page scrolling includes scrolling by roughly the full pane of content less two or three lines for reading continuity. Horizontal scrolling includes moving contents of the screen left or right by a pre determined number of pixels at a time. This may be beneficial if there is much information laid out side by side for example for a large spreadsheet.

Unlike conventional navigation systems such as trackpads on notebook computers an embodiment of the present invention differs in a variety of aspects both structurally e.g. through use of a scroll mechanism integrated with a full size keyboard layout and functionally e.g. through configurability of the scroll mechanism to interact with an application based on its context. For example use of a combination of a keyboard key and the scroll mechanism or scroll wheel as defined previously allows for navigation of all areas of the application. In turn this reduces the number of hand movements and position changes a user must make to accomplish common tasks. The reduced movement eases user fatigue and increases ease of use. By switching the exact action based on context the most common task is always easily accessible using the scroll wheel and the next two most common tasks are available using the scroll wheel in conjunction with the modifier keys of the keyboard.

Referring now to and functionality of one embodiment of the scroll wheel will be described in the context of an electronic mail email application and a file manager application . In the email application is separated into three functional regions relative to the scroll wheel functionality. For example a first region is a selection scroll list where the email messages accumulate in a list format and may be selected based on sender from subject date or size. The items in the list may be navigated by rotating the scroll wheel to trigger a functional response that corresponds to the selection scroll principles described previously.

The second region is a shift scroll pane which previews the selected item from the first region. This illustrates the pane scrolling functionality described previously. In this region the scroll wheel is configured for moving the contents of the pane up Y or down Y based on pressing and holding the SHIFT key and moving the scroll wheel up or down. In another embodiment the system is configured for use of ALT scroll for selection scrolling within a folder list. It is noted that the various scrolling options can be further assigned to other regions of the application. For example the mechanism can be configured e.g. predefined or through a user interface of an application providing scroll key functional management to work with a function key such as ALT on the keyboard along with the scroll wheel in that region. Thus in the email application example ALT scroll allows for pane scrolling or item scrolling depending on the functional definition applied to this combination in the region to the left of the application interface.

Referring now to it illustrates an example of preferences panel for a widget application . In this example the context of the scroll wheel is configured to provide ALT scroll selection in list format in a menu selection pane or region and SHIFT scroll in another pane or region . Within the SHIFT scroll region the context of shift scrolling moves focus based on the operation to be performed. For example there is scroll selection in a drop down box region for selection of DATE TIME options and a shift scroll item on screen in a button region for selection of volume. Thus the scroll wheel is configured for different functionality within the preferences panel of the widget application as well as the email application and file manager application .

In addition the table below describes how elements or regions within an application window can be configured to function in the context of the scroll wheel operation and subsequent use of a space bar key enter key selection button e.g. or button e.g. .

Hence a benefit of a configuration as disclosed herein includes using a scroll mechanism to navigate within an application or window based on the context of that application or window. This increases navigation flexibility and usability by reducing the need for additional navigation commands within each application or window.
