The present invention relates generally to the field of wireless communication systems and more particularly to a method for autonomously monitoring and reporting sound pressure level exposure for a user of a communication device.

Sound level exposure is a safety and preventative health concern for many environments. Exposure to extremely loud noises even for a short period of time can cause permanent hearing damage. Additionally extended exposure to sound even at modest levels may cause hearing loss over time. In the workplace regulatory agencies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH the United States Department of Health and Human Services and others set standard allowable exposure levels and require employers to monitor the sound pressure levels SPLs in their employees work environment. However extreme sound levels incurred by recreational exposure have become increasingly alarming with the prevalent use of stereo headphones and earpieces. Children and teenagers are particularly vulnerable to overexposure as they do not realize the dangers caused by excessive sound levels. Currently there is no method to monitor sound pressure level exposure for a user of an audio communication device.

Additionally approximately 30 million people in the United States are exposed to hazardous occupational noise each year. Fortunately noise induced hearing loss can be reduced or eliminated by successful application of hearing conservation programs protective devices and engineering controls. Currently employers are required to measure the noise level of their employee s work environment. The exposure measurement includes continuous intermittent and impulsive noise within the 80 dB to 130 dB range. Each measurement must be taken in a typical work situation and the employer must provide noise suppression devices to meet a standard noise rejection rating NPR . Additional measurements are required whenever there is a change in the work environment such as changes in production methods different or additional equipment or the introduction of additional workers in the current environment.

Presently occupational SPL monitoring is accomplished using expensive external devices and the measurements are taken sporadically. Under typical circumstances a person e.g. employee or member of a company s occupational safety group physically performs the measurement at a given time and place using a dedicated monitoring device. However noise levels in a given environment are not constant and will often change during the course of the day or from one point in the workplace to another. As a result existing SPL monitoring schemes are not able to capture SPL exposure for a given individual on a continuous or regular basis. Additionally certain employees may be encountering higher noise levels than others because they work different shifts or handle different tools. Therefore even if an employer is complying with regulatory guidelines with respect to employee SPL exposure certain employees may still be routinely exposed to dangerous levels of noise.

Therefore a need exists for among other things a method for autonomously monitoring and reporting sound pressure level exposure that overcomes the shortcomings of the prior art.

Generally the present invention encompasses a method for autonomously monitoring and reporting sound pressure level SPL exposure for a user of a communication device. In one embodiment the communication device measures the SPL for an environment surrounding the communication device. The communication device stores the SPL measurement in an SPL exposure record contained in a memory of the communication device. The device also displays a visual representation of the SPL exposure record on its display screen. The visual representation of the SPL exposure record may include an instantaneous SPL an average SPL and a cumulative SPL. The SPL measurement may be further compared to a predetermined threshold which is calculated as a function of allowable SPL versus time. The communication device alerts the user in the event that the SPL measurement exceeds the predetermined threshold. Additionally the allowable SPL versus time function may be customized for a given user of the communication device.

In one embodiment the communication device delays taking an SPL measurement in the event that the device is engaged in a phone call at a time scheduled for SPL measurement.

In an alternative embodiment a method for monitoring and reporting sound pressure level exposure for a user of a first communication device is implemented by measuring the SPL of the environment surrounding the first communication device at a predetermined time interval. The measured SPL is combined with a known SPL for an output audio transducer of the first communication device producing a cumulative user sound exposure level. The user sound exposure level is transmitted to a second communication device. In one embodiment the second communication device is a wireless telephone and the first communication device is a wireless audio device for use in cooperation with the wireless telephone. The SPL may be measured using a microphone a directional microphone or a multi directional microphone located on either of the communication devices.

In an alternative embodiment a method for monitoring and reporting sound pressure level exposure for a user of a first communication device is implemented when a second communication device receives an SPL exposure record containing a user sound exposure level measured by the first communication device. The user sound exposure level may be calculated as a weighted sum of an SPL measurement of the environment surrounding the first communication device and a known SPL for at least one output audio transducer of the first communication device. The second communication device stores the SPL exposure record in its memory and displays a visual representation of the SPL exposure record on its display screen.

In one embodiment the second communication device compares the user sound exposure level to a predetermined threshold customized for the user and calculated as a function of allowable SPL versus time. The second communication device alerts the user of the first communication device in the event that the user sound exposure level exceeds the predetermined threshold. Additionally the second communication device may transmit a message to the first communication device instructing the device to automatically reduce a volume level of the output audio transducer until the user sound exposure level is reduced to a level below the predetermined threshold.

In an alternative embodiment a SPL tracking server may receive SPL exposure records from one or more communication devices. Each SPL exposure record includes an SPL measurement. In an alternative embodiment each SPL exposure record may also contain a date a time a user identifier and or a communication device identifier. The server stores the SPL records in an accessible memory and displays a visual representation of at least one SPL exposure record on a display screen of one of the communication devices or of a remote terminal. Additionally the server may compare the user sound exposure level for a particular user to a predetermined threshold. The threshold is calculated by an allowable SPL versus time function for the user. The server then sends an alert to the communication device in the event that the user sound exposure level exceeds the predetermined threshold. The allowable SPL versus time function may be customized for each user and depends upon a type of preventive hearing device worn by the particular user. Additionally the function may be determined based on an audiogram for the particular user.

In another embodiment the server may advise the user to take corrective action intended to prevent hearing loss. The corrective action may include moving to a quieter location based on an SPL measurement and a location received from another communication device.

For example a smart phone may include a combination of 1 a pocket PC handheld PC palm top PC or PDA and 2 a mobile telephone.

Referring now to an electrical block diagram of an exemplary portable communication device according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown in more detail. The portable communication device includes a controller processor which controls the operation of the device according to computer instructions stored in program memory . The portable communication device also includes a non volatile memory and a main memory . In one embodiment the main memory includes the program memory and a data memory . An SPL monitor which is discussed in greater detail below is contained in the program memory or other memory. In one embodiment the data memory contains a threshold SPL function and an SPL exposure record . Additionally or alternatively the threshold SPL function and the SPL exposure record may be stored in a removable storage media e.g. a subscriber identity module SIM card a memory stick a USB flash drive or any other portable data storage device which functions under the command of the controller processor .

The wireless communication device transmits and receives signals for enabling wireless communication such as for a cellular telephone in a well known manner. For example when the wireless communication device is in a receive mode the controller processor operates an RF module which couples an RF signal from the antenna to a receiver in a well known manner. The receiver receives converts and demodulates the RF signal providing a stream of data to the decoder encoder module . The decoder encoder module decodes the received data which the controller processor outputs to a user in a prescribed manner. For example audio signals are routed through an audio controller to a speaker or other audio output device. Additionally received textual graphical and or image data is processed by a video controller and presented to the user on a display screen . A receive operational sequence is normally under the control of the controller processor operating in accordance with computer instructions stored in program memory as is well known in the art.

In a transmit mode the controller processor for example responding to a user input such as selection of one or more keys from a keypad or depression of a push to talk button manages the audio controller and couples electronic audio signals from an audio transducer of an internal microphone to the decoder encoder module where the audio signals are converted to an encoded data stream for transmission. The controller processor enables the transmitter circuit which modulates the encoded data onto an RF carrier signal couples the signal through the antenna and transmits the signal through the wireless communication system in a manner well known in the art.

Additionally the audio controller controls the volume level of the audio output through the speaker according to parameters set by the user. The audio controller may also measure the sound pressure level received by an audio input device such as an internal microphone a multi directional microphone a directional microphone not shown and or an external microphone or SPL measuring device connected to the portable communication device through an audio input jack .

In one embodiment the portable communication device also includes a local area wireless module that facilitates short range wireless communications with similarly enabled wireless devices such as a wireless headset a wireless earpiece not shown or a computer system . Signals received by the local area wireless module are decoded by the encoder decoder according to applicable short range communication standards e.g. Bluetooth Wi Fi Wi MAX Zigbee UWB etc. . Additionally data to be transmitted using the local area wireless module is first encoded by the encoder decoder according to the corresponding short range standard. In an alternative embodiment the portable communication device may receive via the local area wireless module SPL exposure information for the user from another portable communication device e.g. a wireless headset performing the actual SPL monitoring in the vicinity of the portable communication device .

Referring now to an electrical block diagram of an exemplary SPL tracking server is shown in more detail according to one embodiment of the present invention. The depicted SPL tracking server includes a controller processor which processes instructions performs calculations and controls the flow of information through the SPL tracking server according to computer instructions stored in program memory .

The controller processor is communicatively coupled to a non volatile memory and a main memory . In one embodiment the main memory includes the program memory and a data memory . The program memory contains a variety of software components including in one embodiment an SPL exposure director an operating system platform and glue software . The operating system platform manages resources such as the data stored in the data memory schedules tasks and processes the operation of the SPL exposure director as discussed in greater detail below. The operating system platform also manages an input interface and a network interface card . The input interface receives inputs from an optional keypad or keyboard mouse touch screen or other input device. The network interface card communicates with other devices through the LAN access point . Additionally the operating system platform further manages many other basic tasks of the server in a manner well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

In one embodiment the glue software includes drivers stacks and low level application programming interfaces APIs . The glue software provides basic functional components for use by the operating system platform and by compatible applications that run on the operating system platform for managing communication resources and processes in the SPL tracking server .

The data memory or another memory component of the server contains an SPL exposure database . The SPL exposure database is a database that contains SPL records for at least one communication device user. Each SPL record contains a user identifier corresponding to a given user a communication device identifier an SPL measurement and a corresponding date and time. The user identifier may contain a user name a user identification number a birth date or any other information used to identify a specific user. The communication device identifier is at least associated with a manufacturer of the communication device and more preferably is further associated with a model or serial number of the communication device.

Additionally or alternatively the SPL exposure database may be stored on a removable storage media e.g. a memory stick a USB flash drive a compact disc CD a digital video disk DVD a floppy disk or any other portable data storage device which is read by a removable storage media reader functioning under the command of the controller processor . Alternatively the SPL exposure database may be located on a remote server accessed through the WAN or in any other memory that is accessible by the SPL tracking server .

In one embodiment the SPL tracking server also includes a local area wireless module to facilitate wireless communication with other wireless enabled communication devices using short range communication standards e.g. Bluetooth IrDA Wi Fi Wi MAX Zigbee UWB etc. . Signals received by the local area wireless module are decoded by the encoder decoder according to the corresponding short range communication protocol. Additionally data to be transmitted using the local area wireless module is first encoded by the encoder decoder according to the same short range communication protocol.

If text graphics or video is to be optionally displayed to a user of the server video output in one embodiment is controlled by a video controller which processes video information and displays the information to a local or remote display screen e.g. monitor .

At step the internal microphone of the portable communication device captures ambient noise and the audio controller measures the SPL of the captured noise. In one embodiment the internal microphone serves the dual purposes of capturing environmental noise for SPL measurement as well as coupling voice signals to the audio controller for transmission in a voice call or other communication. Additionally the microphone may measure noise levels across the entire noise spectrum e.g. 20 Hz to 20 kHz and is not limited to measuring noise having a frequency range within the audible range of human hearing.

The SPL measurement may be taken randomly throughout the day at predetermined intervals continuously or upon user request. In the event that the internal microphone of the portable communication device is being used for a voice call or push to talk functions at a time scheduled for an environmental noise measurement the SPL monitor will in one embodiment delay the scheduled measurement until after the call is completed. In an alternative embodiment the SPL may be captured using a multi directional microphone or a directional microphone not shown dedicated to capturing environmental noise or with an external SPL measuring device communicatively coupled to the audio controller via an external audio input jack .

At step the SPL monitor stores the measured SPL information along with the corresponding date and time of the measurement in a memory of the portable communication device as an SPL exposure record . Each SPL exposure record may further contain a user identifier for the given user and a communication device identifier unique to the portable communication device . The user identifier may contain a user name an identification number a birth date or any other information used to identify a given user. The SPL exposure record may be stored for future retrieval in the data memory of the portable communication device or temporarily in non volatile memory for transmission to other communication devices or the SPL tracking server . The SPL monitor compares the measured SPL to a predetermined threshold at step . If the measured SPL exceeds the threshold the SPL monitor alerts the user of the dangerous condition at step . The alert may include audible visual or haptic e.g. vibration feedback.

The recommended exposure threshold may be set according to regulatory guidelines recommended by governmental agencies e.g. OSHA NIOSHA U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services etc. or may be adjusted to more stringent standards. In one embodiment recommended exposure standards are mapped to a function of allowable SPL exposure versus time. For example assuming for purposes of illustration that a workplace complies with employee SPL exposure limits determined according to OSHA 41 C.F.R. 50 204 10 as illustrated in table of the data in table is correlated using standard curve fitting techniques resulting in an exemplary function 

As another example the curve depicted in graph may be shifted upwards if the user indicates that he she is wearing protective equipment such as ear plugs ear muffs or the like. Each protective device has a standard dB reduction factor that may be taken into consideration when calculating the threshold limitation. For instance a set of ear plugs may dampen the SPL by 15 20 dB. Additionally the set threshold may be an instantaneous point e.g. the noise level has reached an unacceptable level or has remained at or above a certain decibel level for an unacceptable amount of time an area under the curve e.g. the cumulative effect of the noise has reached an unacceptable level or an average SPL exposure value.

Returning to at step the SPL monitor displays a visual representation of the user s SPL exposure record to the user on the display screen of the communication device in the event that the SPL is below the threshold. depicts exemplary visual representations of exposure levels for one SPL model according to the OSHA recommended guidelines illustrated in . Graph represents a user being exposed to an SPL of 90 dB for 2 hours. Because the maximum recommended exposure time for sounds at the 90 dB level is 8 hours the total recommended SPL exposure for this user is now reduced by 25 as shown in graph . Suppose the same user is subsequently exposed to an SPL of 100 dB for one hour as shown in graph . Because the total exposure level for this user has previously been reduced his her recommended exposure time at 100 dB is now only 1.5 hours instead of two hours had the user not been exposed to an SPL of 90 dB for two hours . The one hour exposure at 100 dB further reduces this user s total exposure time by another two thirds as indicated in graph . If the predetermined threshold is set at a 75 exposure level the user will be alerted at this point by a visual representation of the remaining exposure time or his her present exposure level.

In an alternative embodiment the SPL model is determined in a less stringent manner. In this embodiment the total SPL exposure is expressed as the function

An exemplary visual representation may be displayed to the user indicating a measurement of the exposure time remaining to safely remain in the current environment. An alternative visual representation of the user s SPL exposure remaining may depict the SPL exposure as a bar graph color coded with incremental levels from green to red to illustrate a safe to harmful SPL exposure range along with an indicator of the user s present condition. Any additional variations of visual representations of the user s SPL exposure level are within the scope of the present invention. Additionally the visual representation may include representations of the SPL exposure level for the given user with and or without protective hearing equipment.

The SPL exposure record containing the SPL measurement information the corresponding date and time and optionally a user identifier e.g. user name identification number birth date or any other information used to identify a given user and or the communication device identifier is transmitted to an SPL tracking server at step for remote monitoring or historical collection. In this manner employers users parents physicians and even OSHA auditors can access the user sound exposure levels for a given user.

In another embodiment of the present invention the effects of a second communication device such as a wired or wireless headset headphones earphones or other audio device that couples audio signals directly to the user s ear are also taken into consideration. Many audio devices today such as Bluetooth enabled headsets or other audio players contain audio output transducers designed to fit inside the user s ear or are positioned on the user s ear in such a manner as to couple sound directly into the user s ear. Many users especially teenagers and young children are uninformed or unaware of the dangerous effects that long term exposure to loud noise may have on one s hearing. Additionally sound from an audio device when combined with high environmental noise may be particularly and often unnoticeably damage inducing. Therefore an embodiment of the present invention monitors both the sound pressure level of the environmental noise and that of the actual audio output device to provide a cumulative SPL exposure record .

As illustrated in the exemplary logic flow diagram of the audio controller of a first communication device measures the environmental sound pressure level surrounding the device using a microphone located on or in the first communication device . The microphone may be an internal microphone normally used for communication or may be a directional or multi directional microphone used exclusively to monitor environmental sound pressure levels. The first communication device also contains an audio output device such as a speaker that is preferably directly coupled to the user s ear. For example the first wireless device may be a wireless headset having speakers which attach directly to the user s ear or fit inside the user s ear.

The measured environmental SPL information is combined with a known SPL data e.g. volume level of the audio output device for a total sound pressure level exposure at step . SPL data for the audio output device is stored in data memory of the wireless communication device . The SPL data corresponds to an output volume level for the audio output device and may be measured experimentally at the time of original manufacturing for each unique wireless communication device or may be determined from a sampling of similar devices and stored as a default value for each output volume level. The measured environmental SPL data and the known SPL data are combined according to a weighted sum to form a cumulative user sound exposure level wherein the weights for each measurement are dependent upon the type of wireless communication device . At step the combined SPL data along with a corresponding date and time are transmitted to a second communication device e.g. a cellular phone or other communication device with which the first communication device is communicating for further processing.

The SPL monitor compares the combined SPL exposure measurement to a predetermined threshold at step and if the measured level exceeds the threshold the SPL monitor alerts the user of the dangerous condition at step . The SPL monitor may then transmit a message to portable communication device containing instructions to automatically lower the volume of the audio output device to an acceptable sound pressure level at step . Finally the SPL exposure record containing the combined SPL exposure measurement is transmitted to an SPL tracking server at step for remote monitoring or historical collection.

In an alternative embodiment because the SPL tracking server has access to SPL information received from a plurality of communication device users corrective action may include advising the user of the portable communication device to move to a location where the SPL is at a lower level e.g. a location where the SPL measurements received from a different portable communication device are lower . To accommodate this embodiment the SPL exposure record from each communication device may further include a GPS or other location of the communication device.

The SPL exposure director may send a visual representation of the SPL exposure record as well as any corrective action to the display screen of the communication device at step . Alternatively or additionally the SPL exposure director may transmit the information to a display screen of a remote terminal e.g. a computer system in communication with the SPL tracking server . The SPL exposure director may also send an audible alert a visual alert and or a haptic alert such as vibration to the communication device . In an alternative embodiment the SPL exposure director may transmit a message to the communication device instructing the communication device to automatically lower the SPL output of the audio output device e.g. lower the output volume from the audio transducer .

In another embodiment the SPL tracking server may store SPL exposure records received from a plurality of communication devices in an SPL exposure database located in a memory accessible to the server . Each SPL exposure record contains at least one SPL measurement the corresponding date and time the user identifier and the communication device identifier. A user may then view SPL information contained in the SPL exposure records according to a particular user identifier or communication device. For example and not by way of limitation a parent may track the total SPL exposure for his or her child even though the child may use several different communication devices e.g. a cellular phone a wireless headset and an audio player . As another example it is assumed for illustrative purposes only that an organization owns or leases several communication devices e.g. cellular phones pagers two way radios etc. but no worker employee or other user is assigned a communication device on a permanent basis. Instead each user picks up a communication device from a pool of devices for use while the user is on duty. When the worker receives the communication device each day he or she logs on to the device e.g. enters a user name directly into the device using a user interface swipes an ID badge communicates with the device using an RFID or enters a user ID which stores the new user identifier e.g. user name or other identifier in the data memory of the communication device . Thus when the communication device next transmits monitored SPL information the new SPL information is associated with the new user.

In another embodiment the communication device may periodically test and record the hearing capabilities of the user and save the test results as an audiogram. The communication device tests the user s hearing by requiring the user to respond when he she hears a test tone played at a set frequency and volume. The hearing information for the user may be archived in the SPL exposure database and tracked over time for historical purposes. Additionally by tracking the hearing information over time different SPL thresholds maybe set using different functions for a given user depending upon his her individual hearing characteristics as established based on historical audiograms. For example if an audiogram indicates that the user has experienced a significant hearing loss since his or her previous test the user may need to seek medical attention and or use additional hearing protection.

In a further embodiment a parent or employer may set an SPL threshold level for a given user via the SPL exposure director of the SPL tracking server or the SPL monitor of the portable communication device . Additionally a parent employer or other administrator may request to be notified by the communication device or the SPL tracking server in the event that the SPL exposure measurement for a given user exceeds the predetermined threshold.

In an alternative embodiment peer to peer communication between communication devices in a given area allows a user of one communication device e.g. a portable communication device located in an area measuring a high SPL to query other devices within a short range communication area for their present SPL conditions. In this manner the user may decide to relocate to a quieter environment. For example suppose a user was attending a music concert and was seated very close to the speakers. The portable communication device may automatically or responsive to user input send a query to nearby devices requesting SPL measurements. The portable communication device then displays SPL measurements received from other devices to the display screen of the portable communication device . In the event that one of the received measurements is less than the present SPL measurement of the portable communication device the portable communication device may request location information from the device having a lower SPL. The location information may be provided by any active wireless positioning system e.g. Global Positioning System GPS Wi Fi etc. in communication with the lower SPL device. Alternatively a request for location information may be transmitted with the request for the original SPL information. Upon receiving or otherwise determining a location having a lower SPL the user may move to the quieter location.

Finally by collecting SPL data from multiple communication devices in a given area the SPL exposure director of the SPL tracking server may easily pinpoint and quickly resolve any deficiencies an employer may have for a given work environment. Early detection of problem areas previously unknown will prevent potential hearing loss problems for the entire workforce.

As described above the present invention encompasses a method for monitoring and reporting sound pressure level exposure for a user of a communication device. With this invention autonomous monitoring of a sound pressure level exposure for a given user helps to prevent unintended temporary or permanent hearing damage and avoids the expense and inconvenience of requiring dedicated equipment. The communication device monitors ambient environmental noise exposure as well as sound pressure levels of output audio devices and determines whether the user is in a potentially harmful situation for hearing loss. Determination of the potential for hearing loss is based on recommended exposure guidelines as well as individual user characteristics including the use of protective equipment.
