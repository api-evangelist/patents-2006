title: System and method for automating pallet placement on a platform
abstract: An automatic pallet to platform locking system enables pallets of supplies or cargoes to automatically be locked down onto the top of a transportation platform, thus avoiding the use of tie down straps and allowing for automated material handling equipment (MHE) such as a forklift. The present system replaces older, difficult to reconfigure, mostly manual loading and unloading systems and methods with a mechanical interface that allows for relatively easy reconfiguration for different pallet sizes, and that can simplify the task of loading and unloading pallets. The mechanical interface between a pallet and a transportation platform or flatbed is a metal to metal interface. It eliminates the need to tie and secure a strap, which is a time consuming and manual process.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

This invention relates to pallet loading. More particularly the present invention relates to automating pallet loading and securing to a transportation platform with a mechanical interface.

Truck has assumed an increasing role in the transportation of goods in societies with a network of roads. The system and method of loading and unloading goods or cargoes on trucks have been improved to increase flexibility and efficiency. The truck bed for holding cargo is usually flat and came to be known as the flatbed. The cargo that used to be individually wrapped and strapped onto a truck bed is now placed on standardized beds called pallets that are loaded to and from a truck.

Improvements have been made to increase the efficiency of securing loads or pallets onto a truck bed reference is made to U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 543 990 and 4 642 007 . A palletizing system has been disclosed that includes a reusable pallet and a reusable anchoring device for securing cargo. A strap is received and released by a clamping mechanism in a housing on a pallet. A load is placed on a pallet. A strap is put around the load and the pallet. The strap is clamped in a clamping mechanism to secure the load to the pallet. To release the load from the pallet the strap is released from the clamping mechanism.

The load generally of irregular shape from batch to batch is typically manually placed onto the pallet till it is in a stable position. A strap has to be adjusted and tightened to the specific shape and size of the load without causing the load to become unstable a time consuming process. The loading method is manual varies from load to load time consuming and often unsuitable for stacking more than a single layer. If only a part of the load needs to be unloaded the whole load has to be un strapped first a portion is to be unloaded and the remaining load needs to be strapped again a time consuming and redundant process.

Another method was disclosed for a palletized cylinder distribution system. A raised walkway divides a network that mounts on the rear of a truck. On either side of the walkway the cylinders are placed on pallets that are disposed on the network. Tabs extend laterally from the base of the pallets. The tabs engage a flange defined by the walkway and another flange disposed on side rails attached to the network and hold the pallets in place. The bases of the pallets and the surface of the walkway define the bed of the truck. The cylinders are accessed through the walkway.

The loading system and method requires lateral loading of the pallets and vertical loading of cylinders onto the pallets. It is designed for cylindrical loads and not so flexible to accommodate loads of a general shape and size. The flanges are linear and continuous from pallet to pallet raising the possibility of damaging pallet to pallet collisions on delicate contents during loading unloading and transport.

The walkway system constrains pallets by a flange defined by a walkway and another flange defined by a fold up fence. The flanges are defined by the walkway and fold up fence and cannot be quickly reconfigured for different size pallets.

In general an efficient and reliable loading system should be fast to load and reload cargoes of general shape and size. Further the system and method of loading and unloading cargoes should be repeatable every time and be compatible with conventionally available material handling equipment MHE such as a forklift. The system should not utilize straps for security that tend to entangle in unexpected places and pose an obstacle to a fast and smooth loading and unloading process.

There is still an unsatisfied need for an efficient and reliable cargo loading and unloading system and associated method that are compatible with conventional material handling equipment to expeditiously deliver critical mission cargo to the field.

The present invention satisfies this need and presents a system and an associated method collectively referred to herein as the system or the present system for efficient and reliable cargo loading and unloading with conventional moving equipment to expeditiously deliver critical mission cargo to the field.

An object of this invention is to provide a mechanical interface between a flatbed and a pallet that allows for automatic loading and unloading and simplifies the overall loading process.

A further object of this invention is for self alignment capability for a pallet to home in on the mechanical interface on the flatbed once the pallet is in the close vicinity.

Another object of this invention is to provide a quick to deploy re configurable mechanical interface to accommodate pallets of various sizes.

Still an object of this invention is to individually lock each pallet in the mechanical interface for maximum security.

A further object of this invention is to provide flexibility for cargoes of different sizes and shapes.

The foregoing and other objects and features of the present invention are provided by a system that allows for the automatic retention and release of pallets onto the flatbed of a truck. The pallets have for example a base of approximately 50 inch by 40 inch. The flatbed has an exemplary length of approximately 20 feet and a width of approximately 8 feet. In general the system is applicable to loading and unloading pallets of various sizes onto any surface that is sufficiently flat.

The present system enables pallets of supplies to automatically be locked down onto the top of a transportation platform thus avoiding the use of tie down straps and allowing for automated material handling equipment MHE such as a forklift.

The present system replaces older difficult to reconfigure mostly manual loading and unloading systems and methods with a mechanical interface that allows for relatively easy reconfiguration for different pallet sizes and that can simplify the task of loading and unloading cargo.

The mechanical interface between a pallet and a flatbed is a metal to metal interface. It does not utilize straps to eliminate the possibility that a loose strap may accidentally entangle with another object or pose a hazard. It also eliminates the need to tie and secure a strap which is a time consuming and manual process. It further eliminates the need to re strap a load after un strapping when only a part of the load is required at a certain station.

The mechanical interface resides in both the transportation platform or flatbed and the pallet. The flatbed is equipped with mechanical interfaces with each interface is to cooperate with a pendulum on the pallet. A number of mechanical interfaces are positioned on the flatbed to receive and secure a number of pallets. The interfaces may be positioned on the flatbed in a manner to receive and secure pallets of various sizes to further increase flexibility of the system.

The system allows improved security of pallets because most of the pallets are individually secured and positioned at an edge of the flatbed to make for easy access by a forklift. This is an improvement over the older walkway system that constrain pallets by a flange defined by a walkway and another flange defined by a fold up fence.

The present system is referred to herein as an automatic pallet to platform locking system APPLS and includes a transportation platform and a pallet. The system has mechanical interface with components on both the transportation platform and the pallet that which mechanical interface is metal to metal.

Numerous embodiments of the APPLS concept are described herein. All of these embodiments operate on the same underlaying principle but differ in mechanical manifestation of the solution.

In addition the platform mate also provides a mechanical self alignment capability. The transfer mechanism assembly on the pallet has a matching feature shape to the hole and cooperates with the hole on the platform mate for locking the pallet. The platform mate has chamfers and rounds that bump the transfer mechanism assembly on the pallet to correct for alignment error and to guide it into the correct position to mate with the platform mate. Further the transfer mechanism assembly of the pallet can lock with the platform mate.

An exemplary standard pallet has a length of 50 inches and a width of 40 inches. The pallet has a base frame with a transfer mechanism assembly for locking with the platform mate two side ports that each provides pivotal support for the flaps that are rotated by fork tines of a standard or an automated material handling equipment MHE and causes the lock to rotate. When the flap is rotated the lock will slide into and out of the cooperating receptacle on the platform . When the flap is allowed back to its non rotated position the lock will rotate to a locked position and will be unable to be removed from the cooperating receptacle .

The flap as shown in has a continuous surface to engage the fork tines. An exemplary flatbed would accommodate 8 pallets of the same kind arranged on the flatbed in 2 rows. Another exemplary flatbed would accommodate 4 pallets of the same kind arranged on the flatbed in 2 rows as shown in . The installation of platform mates on the flatbed can be reversed such that the flatbed returns to a clear top surface. The mechanical interface on the pallet includes a transfer mechanism assembly that locks with a platform mate on the flatbed or transportation platform.

The pallet is equipped with forklift ports in its base frame for the fork tines to be inserted from two opposing sides and the flaps and locks are equipped to pivot bi directionally around the vertical position.

In an alternative embodiment a sled shown in is mounted onto a flatbed to form a transportation platform and is equipped with a multitude of male mechanical interfaces shown in that are mounted onto the sled. Two male mechanical interfaces on a sled lock with two pendulums from each pallet configured with two pendulum assemblies mirrored about its center point instead of a central lock . In this scenario the pendulum housing resides within the edge of the pallet . A typical sled has a length of 100 inches and a width of 80 inches. The pendulum and male mechanical interface can be used in this case instead of the platform mate in the transportation platform to lock the pallet .

The pendulum rides in the circular track in the pendulum housing . Each pendulum is sandwiched between two of these housings which mate together. Each pallet has two of these sandwiched assemblies located at the midpoint of the short side of the pallet .

The forces in the lockdown scenario involving the pendulum are transferred from the male lockdown feature . As a result the male lockdown feature is secured to the transportation platform via bolts through the bolt holes . The pendulum rotates into the male lockdown feature s center slot . The lip of the male interface feature interfaces on both sides with the lip on the bottom of the pendulum . This force is then transferred through the pendulum length . This force is then transferred from the load bearing surface of the pendulum to the load bearing surface of the pendulum housing . The pair of pendulum housings are affixed within the pallet base at the midpoint along the short edge of the pallet .

The pallet can be locked and unlocked in one of two ways. The first way to lock and unlock the pallet is by an automated material handling equipment MHE utilizing fork tines to rotate flaps in the pallet. represents a top isometric view of a pallet equipped with an alternate embodiment of a flap . In contrast to the continuous surface of the flap in the flap in has a multitude of substantially parallel posts mutually connected that interact with the tines of a forklift. represents a bottom isometric view of the pallet shown in .

Similar to the flap in the flap in can be rotated from a vertical position to a substantially horizontal position or sideways position as the tines of the forklift are inserted into the forklift ports in the pallet to load and unload the pallet. Both the flap and the flap rotate on a pair of pivotal pins in version of the system that uses assembly As explained later in greater detail in that are supported in the pallet by a side port .

An embodiment to lock and unlock the pallet by the first way is by use of a pendulum that is affixed to the pin . As the flap at the side port rotates sideways by the fork tines the pendulum also rotates similarly. After the pallet engages the platform mate with the transfer mechanism assembly seated in the central hole in the mate the fork tines are withdrawn from the pallet. Gravity effect and springs rotates the flap and the pendulum from a substantially horizontal or sideways position to a vertical position placing the pendulum into a male mechanical interface shown in which mechanical interface is suitably placed on the transportation platform as shown in .

To unlock the pallet the fork tines are again inserted into the fork pocket of the pallet rotating the flap sideways inducing the pendulum to rotate similarly and unlocking from the male mechanical interface. At this point the pallet is ready to be raised from the transportation platform for unloading.

Another embodiment in the first way to lock and unlock the pallet is a transfer mechanism without using the pendulum and male mechanical interface . The transfer mechanism is housed in a transfer mechanism assembly in the center of the pallet as shown in and . The transfer mechanism is a class of gears called bevel gear driven by the axle of the flap which is affixed to the flap on one side that connects the bevel gear in the transfer mechanism assembly. As the fork tines rotate the flap the pin is induced to rotate turning the bevel gear and rotating an external knob shown in .

After the pallet is positioned on the transportation platform by the fork tines which rotates the flaps sideways and the transfer mechanism assembly is seated in the hole the fork tines are withdrawn. The flaps rotate to a vertical position turning the bevel gear and inducing the external knob to turn such that the knob locks the platform mate.

To unlock the pallet the fork tines are inserted in the fork pockets of the pallet and rotate the flaps sideways inducing the external knob to rotate and unlock from the platform mate freeing the transfer mechanism assembly to be lifted up from the transportation platform. In this manner the embodiment with only the platform mates on the transportation platform locks and unlocks the pallet.

As already described with the rotating or pivotal flaps and pendulums on the pallet and with the male mechanical interfaces on the sled which is mounted on the flatbed of the transportation platform the pallet can be locked and unlocked by fork tines of an automated material handling equipment MHE . The forklift is a common example of an automated material handling equipment.

A second way to lock or unlock the pallet is to top lift the pallet by use of an automated material handling equipment MHE that is equipped to top lift the pallet. This system utilizes the vertical lifting motion of the top lift pallet to unlock the APPLS system instead of MHE such as fork tines. The motion is transferred via a pull rod from the top of the load to the flap axle which has a moment arm extending in a substantially horizontal manner. The pull rod pulls on the end of this moment arm causing the axle to rotate in exactly the same manner as if the flap was caused to rotated by a fork tine.

The pendulum is affixed to the pin through its hole such that its curved extension rotates without restriction through the curved cavity in the pendulum housing . The housing has a truncated triangular or pyramidal recess at the base to cooperate with a corresponding shape of the male mechanical interface for the pallet to self align and lock with the male mechanical interface.

The pair of side extensions extends outwards to fit in slots in in sliding contact. On the side extensions the upward facing concave surfaces are constrained by the mating convex surfaces or shoulders on the male mechanical interface and lock the pallet to the male mechanical interface on the flatbed when the pallet is lowered down to rest.

The flat top surface has a longitudinal slot that extends downwards into two additional parallel longitudinal slots . The adjoining shoulder between the slot and each of two slots has a convex curvature in the longitudinal axis of slot to match a corresponding curvature surface on a side extension on a pendulum . In cross section the slots and form an inverted T shape to receive and lock a pivoting pendulum from the base of a pallet.

The four corners of the male mechanical interface are fitted with holes such that bolts fasten the male mechanical interface to the flatbed through a spacer . The screws can be quickly installed and uninstalled such that the present system can be reconfigured quickly in the field in response to a sudden change or emergency. They can also be mounted on a modified flatbed such that they can be raised for use or retracted into the bed when not desired without the need for removing bolts.

The base of the pendulum housing has a recess that matches the truncated pyramidal shape of the mating male mechanical interface . Two outwardly extending legs form the base of the recess . When the pallet is lowered in the vicinity of the male mechanical interface in the axial direction of the longitudinal slot one of the two legs of the housing engages and slides down one of the two sides on the male mechanical interface . In this manner the pallet self aligns to the male mechanical interface on its way down or the pendulum to lock with the male mechanical interface.

With the pendulum resting in a vertical position in the cavity in the downwardly convex side extensions lock the pallet to the male mechanical interface in three orthogonal directions. One direction is parallel to and two directions are transverse to the longitudinal axis of the slot .

The pallet in the present system increases flexibility to carry cargo of a general shape and size. The pallet size can be chosen to more closely match the size and shape of the cargo and the remaining void in the pallet can be more easily filled with protective packing materials. For any pallet size chosen the sleds can be easily reconfigured on the transportation platform.

All of these systems are capable of double stacking when the pallet is built with sufficient strength and size. If the pallet is built so the base pallet is the base of a large container that is built to contain the cargo the male receptacles can be incorporated into the top of the container. Thus another pallet may be stacked on top of it and locked down just as it would be on the sled .

All drawings are illustrative in nature and do not depict the actual size or scale of the objects shown. It is to be understood that the specific embodiments of the invention that have been described are merely illustrative of certain applications of the principle of the present invention. Numerous modifications may be made to a system and method to automatically lock pallets to a transportation platform.
