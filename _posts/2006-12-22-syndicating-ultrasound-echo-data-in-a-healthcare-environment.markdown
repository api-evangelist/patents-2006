The invention relates to hardware software and electronic service components and systems to provide large scale reliable and secure foundations for distributed databases and content management systems combining unstructured and structured data and allowing post input reorganization to achieve a high degree of flexibility.

One can envision highly distributed databases capable of managing simultaneous participation by billions of users and highly distributed content management systems coordinating the contributions of billions routinely integrating the contributions of both people and machines and spanning multiple organizations firms and the globe itself. One can imagine flexible systems where data is input in unstructured as well as structured forms and subsequent users can access and present the data in flexible evolving forms not anticipated at the point of data entry. Massively parallel processing envisioned as occurring inside one machine or cluster of machines was once the premier challenge facing the database and content management community. The new challenge in our view is massively parallel and flexible participation of billions.

In order to accomplish this the world will need a new business ecosystem. Advances in information technology often show three related themes that may be thought of as analogous to the biological processes of expansion of and species succession in natural ecosystems. First non expert end users will be empowered to solve problems. Second technology platforms will be created that modularize technology contributions into niches. The niche contributions interrelate with each other through standard protocols and interfaces that are made open to technologists and the general public so that tens hundreds and sometimes millions of innovators can contribute to the resulting business ecosystem each according to his or her choice creativity and competence. In turn new niches will be established opened up and will bring in further new contributors and contributions.

As the business ecosystem expands some specific technological components will become critical enablers to the continuing advance of the whole. Issues of flexibility scale reliability and security will become vital to the community. These vital components for example microprocessors storage controllers and network devices in the personal computer ecosystem will require systematic application of research and development capital investment and coordination with industry partners in order that the whole ecosystem can progress. If the world is to make real the vision of the flexible participation of billions there are a number of core components and systems that have not been invented and will need to be invented.

The flexible participation of billions has been presaged by blogging that is the act of individuals creating Web sites and adding to them more or less daily. By dramatically increasing production and sharing of Web based content the blogging movement now produces a virtual river of content available continuously and with global circulation. Just as word processing empowered millions to create their own documents blogging software has made it relatively easy for millions to produce their own Web sites and keep them continually updated. By the promotion of a simple underlying standard for sharing text and other media blogging has popularized the syndication or passing on of content borrowed from others extending the reach of any given blogger and further increasing the total quantity of information in circulation.

A number of companies have emerged as niche players targeting various aspects of large scale distributed databases content management and group participation. For example some companies such as FeedDemon NewsGator myYahoo Yahoo and Bloglines have focused on client side aggregation and presentation. Companies such as Technorati Google and Feedster have focused on the complementary services of searching for data feeds of interest. Other companies have focused on technologies for providing syndicated data streams such as SixApart Drupal TypePad Flickr Picasa Google and Blogger Google . Other companies have positioned themselves as content providers including new companies such as Engadget Weblogs Inc. Topix.net and MySpace as well as established media companies such as the New York Times and BBC. Of course various generic Internet technologies are also relevant to the rapidly growing weblog data flow such as BitTorrent or Akamai s EdgePlatform.

While offering significant advancement in terms of experiences such as sharing news music videos and other items as well as enabling players of games to interact with each other individually and in groups the value chain is weak fragmented and closed to interoperability among contributors in many areas. The value chain will benefit from both improved contributions in specific functions or niches as well as a more comprehensive overall vision of a possible flexible participations of billions ecosystem additional niches layers and modules of functionality recast functionality among modules rationalization of protocols and interfaces among modules and custom combinations of functions that establish end to end solutions for specific purposes. For example available services are weak in presentation search signal and network routing. Aggregators that centralize content use display formats that are widely criticized despite a general agreement among users that they improve over conventional search engine displays. Storage of most blog content is in proprietary isolated data sets controlled by blog service operators and the data cannot be easily restructured or even moved from one provider to another. In their current form services fail to provide enterprise class features such as security privacy data integrity and quality of service.

There remains a vital need for components and services that explicitly address the challenge of enabling the flexible participation of billions and that are capable of levels of scale reliability security and flexibility as yet unrealized and perhaps unimagined. There is a need for a new global business ecosystem within which innovation by millions of people will be embraced in order to meet the challenge. In order to stimulate the formation and rapid evolution of such a business ecosystem there will have to be systematic development of general purpose software systems and protocols specifically engineered to enable the flexible participation of billions. There also remains a need for such an infrastructure in the health care industry.

Further each of the foregoing systems may also or instead be embodied in a method or in a computer program product embodied in a computer readable medium that when executing on one or more computers performs the steps of such a method.

The terms feed data feed data stream and the like as well as the S definition described further herein as used herein are intended to refer interchangeably to syndicated data feeds and or descriptions of such feeds. While RSS is one popular example of a syndicated data feed any other source of news or other items may be used with the systems described herein such as the outlining markup language OPML and these terms should be given the broadest possible meaning unless a narrow sense is explicitly provided or clear from the context. Similarly terms such as item news item and post as well as the S messages described further herein are intended to refer to items within a data feed and may contain text and or binary data encoding any digital media including still or moving images audio application specific file formats and so on.

The term syndication is intended to refer to publication republication or other distribution of content using any suitable technology including RSS and any extensions or modifications thereto as well as any other publish subscribe or similar technology that may be suitably adapted to the methods and systems described herein. Syndicated is intended to describe content in syndication.

Various embodiments of the present invention are described below including certain embodiments relating particularly to RSS feeds and other syndicated data streams. It should be appreciated however that the present invention is not limited to any particular protocol for data feeds and that the various embodiments discussed explicitly herein are primarily for purposes of illustration. Thus the term syndication generally and references to RSS specifically should be understood to include for example RDF RSS v 0.90 0.91 0.9x 1.0 and 2.0 variously attributable to Netscape UserLand Software and other individuals and organizations as well as Atom from the AtomEnabled Alliance and any other similar formats as well as non conventional syndication formats that can be adapted for syndication such as OPML. Still more generally while RSS technology is described and RSS terminology is used extensively throughout it will be appreciated that the various concepts discussed herein may be usefully employed in a variety of other contexts. For example various privacy and identity techniques described herein could be usefully combined with HTML Web content rather than RSS based XML data. Similarly some of the branding and advertising techniques described herein may be usefully combined with list servers bulletin boards or other Internet news sources. Thus it will be understood that the embodiments described herein are provided by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventive concepts disclosed herein.

As shown in a network may include a plurality of clients and servers connected via an internetwork . Any number of clients and servers may participate in such a system . The system may further include one or more local area networks LAN interconnecting clients through a hub in for example a peer network such as a wired or wireless Ethernet network or a local area network server in for example a client server network . The LAN may be connected to the internetwork through a gateway which provides security to the LAN and ensures operating compatibility between the LAN and the internetwork . Any data network may be used as the internetwork and the LAN .

In one aspect of the systems described herein a device within the internetwork such as a router or on an enterprise level a gateway or other network edge or switching device may cache popular data feeds to reduce redundant traffic through the internetwork . In other network enhancements clients may be enlisted to coordinate sharing of data feeds using techniques such as those employed in a BitTorrent peer to peer network. In the systems described herein these and other techniques generally may be employed to improve performance of an RSS or other data feed network.

In one embodiment the internetwork is the Internet and the World Wide Web provides a system for interconnecting clients and servers in a communicating relationship through the Internet . The internetwork may also or instead include a cable network and at least one of the clients may be a set top box cable ready game console or the like. The internetwork may include other networks such as satellite networks the Public Switched Telephone Network WiFi networks WiMax networks cellular networks and any other public private or dedicated networks that might be used to interconnect devices for transfer of data.

An exemplary client may include a processor a memory e.g. RAM a bus which couples the processor and the memory a mass storage device e.g. a magnetic hard disk or an optical storage disk coupled to the processor and the memory through an I O controller and a network interface coupled to the processor and the memory such as a modem digital subscriber line DSL card cable modem network interface card wireless network card or other interface device capable of wired fiber optic or wireless data communications. One example of such a client is a personal computer equipped with an operating system such as Microsoft Windows XP UNIX or Linux along with software support for Internet communication protocols. The personal computer may also include a browser program such as Microsoft Internet Explorer Netscape Navigator or FireFox to provide a user interface for access to the internetwork . Although the personal computer is a typical client the client may also be a workstation mobile computer Web phone VOIP device television set top box interactive kiosk personal digital assistant wireless electronic mail device or other device capable of communicating over the Internet. As used herein the term client is intended to refer to any of the above described clients or other client devices and the term browser is intended to refer to any of the above browser programs or other software or firmware providing a user interface for navigating an internetwork such as the Internet.

An exemplary server includes a processor a memory e.g. RAM a bus which couples the processor and the memory a mass storage device e.g. a magnetic or optical disk coupled to the processor and the memory through an I O controller and a network interface coupled to the processor and the memory. Servers may be clustered together to handle more client traffic and may include separate servers for different functions such as a database server an application server and a Web presentation server. Such servers may further include one or more mass storage devices such as a disk farm or a redundant array of independent disk RAID system for additional storage and data integrity. Read only devices such as compact disk drives and digital versatile disk drives may also be connected to the servers. Suitable servers and mass storage devices are manufactured by for example Compaq IBM and Sun Microsystems. Generally a server may operate as a source of content and provide any associated back end processing while a client is a consumer of content provided by the server . However it should be appreciated that many of the devices described above may be configured to respond to remote requests thus operating as a server and the devices described as servers may operate as clients of remote data sources. In contemporary peer to peer networks and environments such as RSS environments the distinction between clients and servers blurs. Accordingly as used herein the term server as used herein is generally intended to refer to any of the above described servers or any other device that may be used to provide content such as RSS feeds in a networked environment.

In one aspect a client or server as described herein may provide OPML specific functionality or more generally functionality to support a system using outlining grammar or markup language with processing storage search routing and the like.

For example the network may include an OPML or RSS router. While the following discussion details routing of OPML content it will be understood that the system described may also or instead be employed for RSS or any other outlined or syndicated content. The network may include a plurality of clients that are OPML users and a number of servers that are OPML sources connected via an internetwork . Any number of clients and servers may participate in such a network . A device within the internetwork such as a router or on an enterprise level a gateway or other network edge or switching device may cache popular data feeds to reduce redundant traffic through the internetwork . In other network enhancements clients may be enlisted to coordinate sharing of data feeds using techniques such as those employed in a BitTorrent peer to peer network. In the systems described herein these and other techniques generally may be employed to improve performance of an OPML data network.

A router generally may be understood as a computer networking device that forwards data packets across an internetwork through a process known as routing. A router may act as a junction between two networks transferring data packets between them and validating that information is sent to the correct location. Routing most typically is associated with Internet Protocol IP however specialized routers exist for routing particular types of data such as ADSL routers for asynchronously routing signals across digital subscriber lines. An OPML router may route data across an internetwork such as the Internet which may include data in OPML format. In particular the OPML router may be configured to route data in response to or in correspondence with the structure or the content of an OPML document that is various species of OPML router may be provided that correspond to user developed outline structures in OPML. For example a financial services OPML outline may correspond to a financial services OPML router that is configured to route financial services data packets among constituent networks of one or more financial services institutions.

An OPML router may use a configuration table also known as a routing table to determine the appropriate route for sending a packet including an OPML data packet. The configuration table may include information on which connections lead to particular groups of addresses connection priorities and rules for handling routine and special types of network traffic. In embodiments the configuration table is dynamically configurable in correspondence to the incoming structure of an OPML data packet that is an OPML structure may be provided that includes routing instructions that are automatically executed by the OPML router. In other embodiments a configuration table is configured to route particular portions of an OPML structured document to particular addresses. In embodiments an OPML router includes rules that can be triggered by OPML content such as rules for prioritizing nodes rules for routing OPML content to particular locations and the like. The rules may be triggered by the structure of an OPML document the title or one or more content items within the OPML document.

In the process of transferring data between networks an OPML router may perform translations of various protocols between the two networks including for example translating data from one data format to another such as taking RSS input data and outputting data in another format. In embodiments the OPML router may also protect networks from one another by preventing the traffic on one from unnecessarily spilling over to the other or it may perform a security function by using rules that limit the access that computers from outside the network may have to computers inside the network. The security rules may be triggered by the content of the OPML document the structure of an OPML document or other features such as the author title or the like. For example an OPML router may include an authentication facility that requires an OPML document to contain a password a particular structure an embedded code or the like in order to be routed to a particular place. Such a security feature can protect networks from each other and can be used to enable features such as version control.

OPML routers may be deployed in various network contexts and locations. An OPML edge router may connect OPML clients to the Internet. An OPML core router may serve solely to transmit OPML and other data among other routers. Data traveling over the Internet whether in the form of a Web page a downloaded file or an e mail message travels over a packet switching network. In this system the data in a message or file is broken up into packages approximately 1 500 bytes long. Each of these packages has a wrapper that includes information on the sender s address the receiver s address the package s place in the entire message and how the receiving computer can be sure that the package arrived intact. Each data package called a packet is then sent off to its destination via the best available route. In embodiments the OPML router determines the best available route taking into account the structure of the OPML document including the need to maintain associations among packets. A selected route may be taken by all packets in the message or only a single packet in a message. By packaging data in this manner a network can continuously balance the data load on its equipment. For example if one component of a network is overloaded or malfunctioning data packets may be routed for processing on other network equipment that has a lighter data load and or is properly working. An OPML router may also route OPML content according to semantic structure. For example an OPML router configured to handle medical records may route X Rays to an expert in reading X Rays while routing insurance information to another department of a hospital.

Routers may reconfigure the paths that data packets take because they look at the information surrounding the data packet and can communicate with each other about line conditions within the network such as delays in receiving and sending data and the overall traffic load on a network. An OPML router may communicate with other OPML routers to determine for example whether the entire structure of an OPML document was preserved or whether recipients of a particular component in fact received the routed component. Again the OPML document itself may include a structure for routing it. A router may also locate preferential sources for OPML content using caching and other techniques. Thus for example where an OPML document includes content from an external reference the external reference may be a better source for that portion of the OPML document based upon an analysis of e.g. network congestion geographic proximity and the like.

An OPML router may use a subnet mask to determine the proper routing for a data packet. The subnet mask may employ a model similar to IP addressing. This tells the OPML router that all messages in which the sender and receiver have an address sharing the first three groups of numbers are on the same network and shouldn t be sent out to another network. For example if a computer at address 15.57.31.40 sends a request to the computer at 15.57.31.52 the router will match the first three groups in the IP addresses 15.57.31 and keep the packet on the local network. OPML routers may be programmed to understand the most common network protocols. This programming may include information regarding the format of addresses the format of OPML documents the number of bytes in the basic package of data sent out over the network and the method which insures all the packages reach their destination and get reassembled including into the structure of an OPML document if desired.

There are two major routing algorithms in common use global routing algorithms and decentralized routing algorithms. In decentralized routing algorithms each router has information about the routers to which it is directly connected but does not know about every router in the network. These algorithms are also known as DV distance vector algorithms. In global routing algorithms every router has complete information about all other routers in the network and the traffic status of the network. These algorithms are also known as LS link state algorithms. In LS algorithms every router identifies the routers that are physically connected to them and obtains their IP addresses. When a router starts working it first sends a HELLO packet over the network. Each router that receives this packet replies with a message that contains its IP address. All routers in the network measure the delay time or any other important parameters of the network such as average traffic for its neighboring routers within the network. In order to do this the routers send echo packets over the network. Every router that receives these packets replies with an echo reply packet. By dividing round trip time by two routers can compute the delay time. This delay time includes both transmission and processing times i.e. the time it takes the packets to reach the destination and the time it takes the receiver to process them and reply . Because of this inter router communication each OPML router within the network knows the structure and status of the network and can use this information to select the best route between two nodes of a network.

The selection of the best available route between two nodes on a network may be done using an algorithm such as the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm. In this algorithm an OPML router based on information that has been collected from other OPML routers builds a graph of the network. This graph shows the location of OPML routers in the network and their links to each other. Every link is labeled with a number called the weight or cost. This number is a function of delay time average traffic and sometimes simply the number of disparate links between nodes. For example if there are two links between a node and a destination the OPML router chooses the link with the lowest weight.

Closely related to the function of OPML routers OPML switches may provide another network component that improves data transmission speed in a network. OPML switches may allow different nodes a network connection point typically a computer of a network to communicate directly with one another in a smooth and efficient manner. Switches that provide a separate connection for each node in a company s internal network are called LAN switches. Essentially a LAN switch creates a series of instant networks that contain only the two devices communicating with each other at that particular moment. An OPML switch may be configured to route data based on the OPML structure of that data.

In one embodiment an OPML router may be a one armed router used to route packets in a virtual LAN environment. In the case of a one armed router the multiple attachments to different networks are all over the same physical link. OPML routers may also function as an Internet gateway e.g. for small networks in homes and offices such as where an Internet connection is an always on broadband connection like cable modem or DSL.

The network may also or instead include an OPML server as described in greater detail below. OPML which may for example be encapsulated within an RSS data feed may contain one or more RSS channel identifiers or items or may be a separate document has the general format shown in the OPML specification hosted at www.opml.org spec the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. The structure generally includes OPML delimiters general authorship and creation data formatting viewing data if any and a series of outline entries according to a knowledge structure devised by the author.

An OPML server may be provided for manipulating OPML content. The OPML server may provide services and content to clients using for example a Web interface an API an XML processing interface an RSS feed an OPML renderer and the like.

The OPML server may for example provide a search engine service to visitors. Output from the OPML server may be an OPML file an HTML file or any other file suitable for rendering to a client device or subsequent processing. The file may for example have a name that explicitly contains the search query from which it was created in order to facilitate redistribution modification recreation synchronization updating and storage of the OPML file. A user may also manipulate the file such as by adding or removing outline elements representing individual search results or by reprioritizing or otherwise reorganizing the results and the user may optionally store the revised search as a new OPML file. Thus in one aspect the OPML server may create new original OPML content based upon user queries submitted thereto. In a sense this function is analogous to the function of aggregators in an RSS syndication system where new content may be dynamically created from a variety of different sources and republished in a structured form.

The OPML server may more generally provide a front end for an OPML database that stores OPML content. The OPML database may store OMPL data in a number of forms such as by casting the OPML structure into a corresponding relational database where each OPML file is encapsulated as one or more records. The OPML database may also store links to external OPML content or may traverse OPML content through any number of layers and store data files and the like externally referenced in OPML documents. Thus for example where an OPML file references an external OPML file that external OPML file may be retrieved by the database and parsed and stored. The external OPML file may in turn reference other external OPML files that may be similarly processed to construct within the database an entire OPML tree. The OMPL database may also or instead store OPML files as simple text or in any number of formats optimized for searching such as a number of well known techniques used by large scale search engines Google AltaVista and the like or for OPML processing or for any other purpose s . The OPML database may provide coherency for formation of an OPML network among an array of clients and servers where content within the network is structured according to user created OPML outlines.

The OPML server may provide a number of functions or services related to OPML content. For example the OPML server may permit a user to publish OPML content either at a hosted site or locally from a user s computer. The OPML server may provide a ping service for monitoring updates of OPML content. The OPML server may provide a validation service to validate content according to the OPML specification. The OPML server may provide a search service or function which may permit searching against a database of OPML content or it may provide user configurable spidering capabilities to search for OPML content across a wide area network. The OPML server may provide an interface for browsing or more generally navigating and or reading OPML content. The OPML server may provide tools for creating editing and or managing OPML content.

The OPML server may provide a number of complementary functions or services to support OPML based transactions content management and the like. In one aspect a renderer or converter may be provided to convert between a structured format such as OPML and a presentation format such as PowerPoint and display the respective forms. While the converter may be used with OPML and PowerPoint it should be understood that the converter may be usefully employed with a variety of other structured hierarchical or outlined formats and a variety of presentation formats or programs. For example the presentation format may include Portable Document Format Flash Animation electronic books a variety of Open Source alternatives to PowerPoint e.g. OpenOffice.org s Presenter KDE s KPresenter HTML Slidy and so forth whether or not they are PowerPoint compatible. The structured format may include OPML an MS Word outline simple text or any other structured content as well as files associated with leaf nodes thereof such as audio visual moving picture text spreadsheet chart table graphic or any other format any of which may be rendered in association with the structured format and or converted between a structured format and a presentation format It will also be understood that the converter may be deployed on a client device for local manipulation processing and or republication of content.

The OPML database may for example operate through the OPML server to generate monitor and or control spiders that locate OPML content. A spider may upon identification of a valid OPML file retrieve the file and process it into the database. A spider may also process an OPML file to identify external references systematically traversing an entire OPML tree. A spider may be coordinated using known techniques to identify redundant references within a hierarchy. A spider may also differentiate processing according to e.g. structure content location file types metadata and the like. The user interface described below may also include one or more tools for configuring spiders including a front end for generating initial queries displaying results and tagging results with any suitable metadata.

By way of example and not of limitation medical records may be stored as OPML files either within the database or in a distributed fashion among numerous locations across the OPML network. Thus for example assorted X Ray data may be maintained in one location MRI data in another location patient biographical data in another location and clinical notes in another location. These data may be entirely decoupled from individual patients thus offering a degree of security privacy and optionally may include references to other content such as directories of other types of data directories of readers or interpretive metadata for understanding or viewing records and the like. Separately OPML files may be created to provide structure to the distributed data. For example a CT Scan OPML master record may index the locations of all CT Scan records which may be useful for example for studies or research relating to aggregated CT Scan data. This type of horizontal structure may be captured in one or more OPML records which may themselves be hierarchical. Thus for example one OPML file may identify participating hospitals by external reference to OPML records for those hospitals. Each hospital may provide a top level OPML file that identifies OPML records that are available which may in turn identify all CT Scan records maintained at that hospital. The CT Scan master record may traverse the individual hospital OPML records to provide a flattened list of CT Scan records available in the system. As another example an OPML file may identify medical data for a particular patient. This OPML file may traverse records of any number of different hospitals or other medical institutions or it may directly identify particular records where for example concerns about confidentiality cause institutions to strip any personally identifying data from records. For certain applications it may be desirable to have a central registry of data so that records such as patient data are not inadvertently lost due to for example data migration within a particular hospital.

Thus in one embodiment there is generally disclosed herein a pull based data management system in which atomic units of data are passively maintained at any number of network accessible locations while structure is imposed on the data through atomic units of relationship that may be arbitrarily defined through OPML or other grammars. The source data may be selectively pulled and organized according to user defined OPML definitions. The OPML server and OPML database may enable such a system by providing a repository for organization and search of source data in the OPML network. Traversing OPML trees to fully scope an outline composed of a number of nested OPML outlines may be performed by a client or may be performed by the OPML server either upon request from a client for a particular outline or continually in a manner that insures integrity of external reference links.

In another aspect there is disclosed herein a link maintenance system for use in an OPML network. In general a link maintenance system may function to insure integrity of external references contained within OPML files. Broken links which may result for example from deletion or migration of source content may be identified and addressed in a number of ways. For example a search can be performed using the OPML server and OPML database for all OPML files including a reference to the missing target. Additionally the OPML server and or OPML database may include a registry of content sources including an e mail contact manager administrator of outside sources. Notification of the broken link including a reference to the content may be sent to all owners of content. Optionally the OPML server may automatically modify content to delete or replace the reference assuming the OPML server has authorization to access such content. The OPML server may contact the owner of the missing content. The message to the owner may include a request to provide an alternative link which may be forwarded to owners of all content that references the missing content. If the referenced subject matter has been fully indexed by the OPML server and or OPML database the content may itself be reconstructed and a replacement link to the location of the reconstructed content provided. Various combinations of reconstruction and notification such as those above may be applied to maintain the integrity of links in OPML source files indexed in the database. In various embodiments the links may be continuously verified and updated or the links may be updated only when an OPML document with a broken link is requested by a client and processed or traversed by the client or the OPML server in response.

The OPML server may provide a client accessible user interface to view items in a data stream or OMPL outline. The user interface may be presented for example through a Web page viewed using a Web browser or through an outliner or outline viewer specifically adapted to display OPML content. In general an RSS or OPML file may be converted to HTML for display at a Web browser of a client . For example the source file on a server may be converted to HTML using a Server Side Include SSI to bring the content into a template by iterating through the XML RSS internal structure. The resulting HTML may be viewed at a client or posted to a different server along with other items. The output may also or instead be provided in OPML form for viewing through an OPML renderer. Thus feeds and items may be generally mixed shared forwarded and the like in a variety of formats.

Again it is noted that specific references to OPML and RSS above are not intended to be limiting and more generally should be understood as references to any outlining syndication or other grammar suitable for use with the systems described herein.

Focusing now on the internetwork one embodiment is the Internet. The structure of the Internet is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and includes a network backbone with networks branching from the backbone. These branches in turn have networks branching from them and so on. The backbone and branches are connected by routers bridges switches and other switching elements that operate to direct data through the internetwork . For a more detailed description of the structure and operation of the Internet one may refer to The Internet Complete Reference by Harley Hahn and Rick Stout published by McGraw Hill 1994. However one may practice the present invention on a wide variety of communication networks. For example the internetwork can include interactive television networks telephone networks wireless voice or data transmission systems two way cable systems customized computer networks Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks and so on. Clients may access the internetwork through an Internet Service Provider ISP not shown or through a dedicated DSL service ISDN leased lines T1 lines OC3 lines digital satellite service cable modem service or any other connection or through an ISP providing same.

In its present deployment as the Internet the internetwork includes a worldwide computer network that communicates using the well defined Transmission Control Protocol TCP and Internet Protocol IP to provide transport and network services. Computer systems that are directly connected to the Internet each have a unique IP address. The IP address consists of four one byte numbers although a planned expansion to sixteen bytes is underway with IPv6 . To simplify Internet addressing the Domain Name System DNS was created. The DNS allows users to access Internet resources with a simpler alphanumeric naming system. A DNS name consists of a series of alphanumeric names separated by periods. When a domain name is used the computer accesses a DNS server to obtain the explicit four byte IP address. It will be appreciated that other internetworks may be used with the invention. For example the internetwork may be a wide area network a local area network a campus area network or corporate area network. The internetwork may be any other network used to communicate data such as a cable broadcast network.

To further define the resources on the Internet the Uniform Resource Locator system was created. A Uniform Resource Locator URL is a descriptor that specifically defines a protocol for an Internet resource along with its location. URLs have the following format 

in which the domain address and path name provide a location for a resource and the protocol defines the type of protocol used to access the resource. It will be appreciated that in the context of this paragraph only the term resource is used in the conventional sense of RFC 1738 to refer to a document image or the like available on the Web. Web documents are identified by the protocol http which indicates that the hypertext transfer protocol should be used to access the document. Other common protocols include ftp file transmission protocol mailto send electronic mail file local file and telnet. The domain.address defines the domain name address of the computer on which the resource is located. Finally the path name defines a directory path within the file system of the server that identifies the resource. As used herein the term IP address is intended to refer to the four byte Internet Protocol address or the expanded address provided by IPv6 and the term Web address is intended to refer to a domain name address along with any resource identifier and path name appropriate to identify a particular Web resource. The term address when used alone may refer to either a Web address or an IP address.

In an exemplary embodiment a browser executing on one of the clients retrieves a Web document at an address from one of the servers via the internetwork and displays the Web document on a viewing device e.g. a screen. A user can retrieve and view the Web document by entering or selecting a link to a URL in the browser. The browser then sends an http request to the server that has the Web document associated with the URL. The server responds to the http request by sending the requested Web document to the client . The Web document is an HTTP object that includes plain text ASCII conforming to the HyperText Markup Language HTML . Other markup languages are known and may be used on appropriately enabled browsers and servers including the Dynamic HyperText Markup Language DHTML the Extensible Markup Language XML the Extensible Hypertext Markup Language XHML and the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML .

Each Web document usually contains hyperlinks to other Web documents. The browser displays the Web document on the screen for the user and the hyperlinks to other Web documents are emphasized in some fashion such that the user can identify and select each hyperlink. To enhance functionality a server may execute programs associated with Web documents using programming or scripting languages such as Perl C C C or Java or a Common Gateway Interface CGI script to access applications on the server. A server may also use server side scripting languages such as ColdFusion from MacroMedia or PHP. These programs and languages may perform back end functions such as order processing database management and content searching. A Web document may also contain or include references to small client side applications or applets that are transferred from the server to the client along with a Web document and are executed locally by the client . Java is one popular example of a programming language used for applets. The text within a Web document may further include non displayed scripts that are executable by an appropriately enabled browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript or Visual Basic Script. Browsers may further be enhanced with a variety of helper applications to interpret various media including still image formats such as JPEG and GIF document formats such as PS and PDF motion picture formats such as AVI and MPEG animated media such as Flash media and sound formats such as MP3 and MIDI. These media formats along with a growing variety of proprietary media formats may be used to enrich a user s interactive and audio visual experience as each Web document is presented through the browser. The term page as used herein is intended to refer to the Web document described above as well as any of the above described functional or multimedia content associated with the Web document.

In general operation a server may provide a data stream to a client . In an exemplary embodiment the data stream may be a syndicated data stream such as RSS an XML grammar for sharing data through the Web. An RSS enabled server may include an RSS file with a title and description of items to be syndicated. As with simple HTML documents the RSS file may be hand coded or computer generated. The first line of an RSS file may contain an XML declaration of the form 

While not strictly required this declaration may improve version compatibility. The next item in an RSS file may be a Document Type Declaration DTD that identifies the file as an RSS document 

The RSS element is the root or top level element of an RSS file. The RSS element must specify the version attribute in this example version 0.91 . It may also contain an encoding attribute the default is UTF 8 

The root element is the top level element that contains the rest of an XML document. An RSS element may contain a channel with a title the name of the channel description short description of the channel link HTML link to the channel Web site language language encoding of the channel such as en us for U.S. English and one or more item elements. A channel may also contain the following optional elements 

A channel may contain an image or logo. In RSS the image element contains the image title and the URL of the image itself. The image element may also include the following optional elements a link a URL that the image links to a width a height and a description additional text displayed with the image . There may also be a text input element for an HTML text field. The text input element may include a title label for a submit button description name and link to send input . The link may enable richer functionality such as allowing a user to submit search terms send electronic mail or perform any other text based function.

Once defined in this manner a channel may contain a number of items although some services e.g. Netscape Netcenter may limit the number. In general the item elements provide headlines and summaries of the content to be shared. New items may be added either manually or automatically such as through a script by appending them to the RSS file.

The content source may provide any electronic content including newspaper articles Web magazine articles academic papers government documents such as court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates or the like opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analysis current events bulletins and the like. The content may include text formatting layout graphics audio files image files movie files word processing files spreadsheet files presentation files electronic documents HTML files executable files scripts multi media relational databases data from relational databases and or any other content type or combination of types suitable for syndication through a network. The content source may be any commercial media provider s such as newspapers news services e.g. Reuters or Bloomberg or individual journalists such as syndicated columnists. The content source may also be from commercial entities such as corporations non profit corporations charities religious organizations social organizations or the like as well as from individuals with no affiliation to any of the foregoing. The content source may be edited as with news items or automated as with data feeds such as stock tickers sports scores weather conditions and so on. While written text is commonly used in data feeds it will be appreciated that any digital media may be binary encoded and included in an item of a data feed such as RSS. For example data feeds may include audio moving pictures still pictures executable files application specific files e.g. word processing documents or spreadsheets and the like. It should also be understood that while a content source may generally be understood as a well defined source of items for a data feed the content source may be more widely distributed or subjectively gathered by a user preparing a data feed . For example an individual user interested in automotive mechanics may regularly read a number of related magazines and regularly attend trade shows. This information may be processed on an ad hoc basis by the individual and placed into a data feed for review and use by others. Thus it will be understood that the data stream systems described herein may have broad commercial use as well as non commercial educational and mixed uses.

As described generally above the data feed may include for each item of content summary information such as a title synopsis or abstract or a teaser for more marketing oriented materials and a link to the underlying content. Thus as depicted in when a client accesses a data feed as depicted by an arrow the client may then display the summary information for each item in a user interface. A client may in response to user input such as clicking on a title of an item in the user interface retrieve the underlying item from the content source as indicated by an arrow . In the bi directional communication depicted by the arrow the client may also identify the specific data feed through which the item was identified which may be useful for tracking distribution channels customer behavior affiliate referral fees and so forth. It should be appreciated that an RSS data feed may be presented to a client as an RSS file in XML format that the client locally converts to HTML for viewing through a Web browser or the data feed may be converted to HTML at a Web site that responds to HTTP requests from a client and responds with an HTML formatted data feed.

A related concept is the so called permalink that provides a permanent URL reference to a source document that may be provided from for example a dynamically generated Web site or a document repository served from a relational database behind a Web server. While there is no official standard for permalink syntax or usage they are widely used in conjunction with data feeds. Permalinks typically consist of a string of characters which represent the date and time of posting and some system dependent identifier which includes a base URL and often identifies the author subscriber or department which initially authored the item . If an item is changed renamed or moved its permalink remains unaltered. If an item is deleted altogether its permalink cannot be reused. Permalinks are exploited in a number of applications including link tracing and link track back in Weblogs and references to specific Weblog entries in RSS or Atom syndication streams. Permalinks are supported in most modern weblogging and content syndication software systems including Movable Type LiveJournal and Blogger.

RSS provides a standard format for the delivery of content through data feeds. This makes it relatively straightforward for a content provider to distribute content broadly and for an affiliate to receive and process content from multiple sources. It will be appreciated that other RSS compliant and or non RSS compliant feeds may be syndicated as that term is used herein and as is described in greater detail below. As noted above the actual content may not be distributed directly only the headlines which means that users will ultimately access the content source if they re interested in a story. It is also possible to distribute the item of content directly through RSS though this approach may compromise some of the advantages of network efficiency items are not copied and distributed in their entirety and referral tracking. Traffic to a Web site that hosts a content source can increase in response to distribution of data feeds .

Although not depicted a single content source may also have multiple data feeds . These may be organized topically or according to target clients . Thus the same content may have data feeds for electronic mailing lists PDAs cell phones and set top boxes. For example a content provider may decide to offer headlines in a PDA friendly format or it may create a weekly email newsletter describing what s new on a Web site.

Data feeds in a standard format provide for significant flexibility in how content is organized and distributed. An aggregator for example may be provided that periodically updates data from a plurality of data feeds . In general an aggregator may make many data feeds available as a single source. As a significant advantage this intermediate point in the content distribution chain may also be used to customize feeds and presentation thereof as well as to filter items within feeds and provide any other administrative services to assist with syndication distribution and review of content.

As will be described in greater detail below the aggregator may filter prioritize or otherwise process the aggregated data feeds. A single processed data feed may then be provided to a client as depicted by an arrow . The client may request periodic updates from the data feed created by the aggregator as also indicated by an arrow . As indicated by an arrow the client may also configure the aggregator such as by adding data streams removing data streams searching for new data streams explicitly filtering or prioritizing items from the data streams or designating personal preferences or profile data that the aggregator may apply to generate the aggregated data feed . When an item of interest is presented in the user interface of the client a user may select a link to the item causing the client to retrieve the item from the associated content source as indicated by an arrow . The aggregator may present the data feed as a static web page that is updated only upon an explicit request from the client or the aggregator may push updates to a client using either HTTP or related Web browser technologies or by updates through some other channel such as e mail updates. It will also be appreciated that while the aggregator is illustrated as separate from the client the aggregator may be realized as a primarily client side technology where software executing on the client assumes responsibility for directly accessing a number of data feeds and aggregating filtering results from those feeds .

It will be appreciated that a user search for feeds will be improved by the availability of well organized databases. While a number of Weblogs provide local search functionality and a number of aggregator services provide lists of available data feeds there remains a need for a consumer level searchable database of feed content. As such one aspect of the system described herein is a database of data feeds that is searchable by contents as well as metadata such as title and description. In a server used with the systems described herein the entire universe of known data feeds may be hashed or otherwise organized into searchable form in real time or near real time. The hash index may include each word or other symbol and any data necessary to locate it in a stream and in a post.

The advent of commonly available data feeds such as RSS feeds along with tools such as aggregators enables new modes of communication. In one common use a user may through a client post aggregated feeds to a Weblog. The information posted on a Weblog may include an aggregated feed one or more data feeds that are sources for the aggregated feed and any personal political technical or editorial comments that are significant to the author. As such all participants in an RSS network may become authors or sources of content as well as consumers.

At present the consumer to consumer market model consists primarily of millions of individual bloggers mostly communicating with each other. This includes non commercial Weblogs where individuals aggregate data feeds from a variety of sources and include editorial commentary or other information. In general a source in this space is an individual presenting aggregated feeds in a Web site with some common theme or themes of interest to the author such as history sports science technology politics literature art music and so forth. However there are no strict requirements that any one or more themes be followed and the Weblog may simply reflect an ad hoc selection of topics that the author finds interesting. Weblogs in this space gain popularity according to the content provided with readership and associated RSS subscriptions or registrations rising or falling according to general interest.

The consumer to business model or segment brings together consumers who are interested in a particular topic typically a topic with a corresponding commercial market such as automobiles mortgages financial services home repair hobbies and the like. A topic may be still more refined such as antique automobiles or antique American automobiles however the corresponding participation of commercial participants may depend on the scope of the market. Thus a large number of financial service providers could be expected to subscribe to an RSS data feed for general consumers of financial services however a smaller number of commercial subscribers might be expected for derivative currency hedge instruments among Pacific Rim country currencies. In general consumer to business uses may provide consumers with concerns interests and preferences in a particular market with a forum that will be followed by corresponding commercial interests. In addition by participating in this RSS network businesses may also address consumer interests in a more direct and personal way as distinguished from the business to consumer segment discussed below. At the same time it will be appreciated that the distinction between these segments need not be an absolute one and a synthesis of these two communication channels may result in a greater dialogue between commercial and individual actors to their collective and mutual benefit. Thus for example with a suitably configured aggregated feed and associated Web presentation an automobile manufacturer could design a new minivan or SUV in cooperation with the automobile buying public in a manner that addresses previously unknown purchasing preferences of consumers. Additionally since the community of participants is likely to be highly focused this segment may offer significant opportunities for revenue from targeted advertising.

The business to business segment does not appear to be commonly used although in the methods and systems described herein syndication may substitute for electronic mail and other forms of corporate and business to business communication such as time management inventory supply chain manufacturing and customer relations information flow.

The business to consumer segment includes an extension of traditional media companies that can add data feed capabilities to their online presence. This includes news companies in print media radio television media and Internet media including by way of example and not limitation the New York Times the Washington Post the Wall Street Journal Forbes Time Business Week CSPAN ESPN The Weather Channel CNBC CNET Bloomberg Reuters and so on. This may also include non news related media that nonetheless periodically update content such as movie studios network television cable television and so on. In addition other companies that serve consumers may also usefully employ data feed systems including companies ranging from catalogue companies such as Land s End to consumer electronics retailers such as Best Buy. In this context a syndication platform such as enhanced RSS offers a reliable distribution channel for advertising new products and special offers to presumably interested consumers. These and other applications may be realized using the data feed technology described herein.

All such entity to entity communications described above may be improved through enhanced syndication systems as generally described herein. It will be appreciated that one obstacle to expanded use across all of these markets is the absence in the primary technology RSS of enterprise class features such as security authentication conditional access data repositories and rich metadata to name a few. In one aspect the systems described herein bring many of these features to RSS like systems to provide secure scalable syndication systems.

It should be clear that while the term aggregator is used to label aspects of the systems disclosed herein those systems include significant useful and advantageous functionality that is not present in any aggregator in the prior art and as such the term should be interpreted broadly to optionally include all of the functions and techniques described below rather than narrowly in the sense that it is currently used in the art. Although broader in meaning the aggregator and interface described below may operate for example from one of the servers described above with reference to and may cooperate with other participants and content sources in the manner depicted for the aggregator described in .

It will be appreciated that the components described herein correspond generally to various areas of functionality for a data feed system. However in various embodiments other components may be added or certain components may be removed or combined with other components. For example the aggregator described herein may cooperate with an n tier architecture for a more general purpose Web server or with a relational database or other back end systems not specifically depicted herein to store and access data. Similarly the systems described herein may include FTP servers e mail servers PSTN interfaces and other physical connections and protocols for various other functions that may be usefully combined with the aggregator to enhance functionality. Any number of such combinations and variations may be employed consistent with the systems described herein and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

It will also be appreciated that a wide range of software and hardware platforms may be used to deploy the systems described herein. Generally the system components may be realized in hardware software or some combination of these. The components may be realized in one or more microprocessors microcontrollers embedded microcontrollers programmable digital signal processors or other programmable devices along with internal and or external memory such as read only memory programmable read only memory electronically erasable programmable read only memory random access memory dynamic random access memory double data rate random access memory Rambus direct random access memory flash memory or any other volatile or non volatile memory for storing program instructions program data and program output or other intermediate or final results. The components may also or instead include one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs dedicated semiconductor devices programmable gate arrays programmable array logic devices or any other device that may be configured to process electronic signals.

Any combination of the above circuits and components whether packaged discretely as a chip as a chip set or as a die may be suitably adapted to use with the systems described herein. It will further be appreciated that the above components may be realized as computer executable code created using a structured programming language such as C an object oriented programming language such as C or any other high level or low level programming language that may be compiled or interpreted to run on one of the above devices as well as heterogeneous combinations of processors processor architectures or combinations of different hardware and software.

At the same time it should be understood that the number arrangement and functions of the layers may be varied in a number of ways within a syndication system in particular depending on the characteristics of the sources the needs of the users and the features desired for particular applications a number of improved configurations for syndication systems may be established representing favorable combinations and sub combinations of layers depicted in . The layers may provide services such as for example services related to applications other services including relating to processing services related to data services related to semantics of content syndication services and services related to infrastructure . More generally all of the services and functions described below either individual or in combinations as well as other services not specifically mentioned may be incorporated into an enhanced syndication system as described herein. It should be understood that any of the services depicted in the layers of may be embodied in hardware software firmware or a combination thereof for example a service may be embodied in software as a web service according to a services oriented architecture. Alternatively without limitation a service may be a client side or server side application or take any of the forms described herein and in the documents incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment one or more layers may be embodied in a dedicated semiconductor device such as an ASIC that is configured to enable syndication.

Services related to applications may be embodied for example in a client side application including commercially available applications such as a word processor spreadsheet presentation software database system task management system supply chain management system inventory management system human resources management system user interface system operating system graphics system computer game electronic mail system calendar system media player and the like a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack a web service a service oriented architecture service a Java applet or a combination of these. Applications may include for example a user interface social networking vertical market applications media viewers transaction processing alerts event action pairs analysis and so forth. Applications may also accommodate vertical market uses of other aspects of the system by integrating various aspects of for example security interfaces databases syndication and the like. Examples of vertical markets include financial services health care electronic commerce communications advertising sales marketing supply chain management retail accounting professional services and so forth. In one aspect the applications may include social networking tools to support functions such as sharing and pooling of syndicated content content filters content sources content commentary and the like as well as formation of groups affiliations and the like. Social networking tools may support dynamic creation of communities and moderation of dialogues within communities while providing individual participants with any desired level of anonymity. Social networking tools may also or instead evaluate popularity of feeds or items in a syndication network or permit user annotation evaluation or categorization. A user interface from the application may also complement other services layers. For example an application may provide a user interface that interprets semantic content to determine one or more display characteristics for associated items of syndicated content.

Other services may include any other services not specifically identified herein that may be usefully employed within an enhanced syndication system. For example content from the sources may be formatted for display through a formatting service that interprets various types of data and determines an arrangement and format suitable for display. This may also include services that are specifically identified which may be modified enhanced or adapted to different uses through the other services . Other services may support one or more value added services. For example a security service may provide for secure communications among users or from users to sources. An identity service may provide verification of user or source identities such as by reference to a trusted third party. An authentication service may receive user credentials and control access to various sources or other services within the system. A financial transaction service may execute financial transactions among users or between users and sources . Any service amenable to computer implementation may be deployed as one or more other services either alone or in combination with services from other elements of the system .

Data services may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Data services may include for example search query view extract or any other database functions. Data services may also or instead include data quality functions such as data cleansing deduplication and the like. Data services may also or instead include transformation functions for transforming data between data repositories or among presentation formats. Thus for example data may be transformed from entries in a relational database or items within an OPML outline into a presentation format such as MS Word MS Excel or MS PowerPoint. Similarly data may be transformed from a source such as an OPML outline into a structured database. Data services may also or instead include syndication specific functions such as searching of data feeds or items within data feeds or filtering items for relevance from within selected feeds or clustering groups of searches and or filters for republication as an aggregated and or filtered content source . In one aspect a data service as described herein provides a repository of historical data feeds which may be combined with other services for user configurable publication of aggregated filtered and or annotated feeds. More generally data services may include any functions associated with data including storing manipulating retrieving transforming verifying authenticating formatting reformatting tagging linking hyperlinking reporting viewing and so forth. A search engine deployed within the data services may permit searching of data feeds or with a content database as described herein searching or filtering of content within data feeds from sources . Data services may be adapted for use with databases such as commercially available databases from Oracle Microsoft IBM and or open source databases such as MySQL AB or PostgreSQL.

In one aspect data services may include services for searching and displaying collections of OPML or other XML based documents. This may include a collection of user interface tools for finding building viewing exploring and traversing a knowledge structure inherent or embedded in a collection of interrelated or cross linked documents. Such a system has particular utility for example in creating a structured knowledge directory of OPML structures derived from an exploration of relationships among individual outlined OPML documents and the nodes thereof such as end nodes that do not link to further content . In one embodiment the navigation and building of knowledge structures may advantageously be initiated from any point within a knowledge structure such as an arbitrarily selected OPML document within a tree. A user interface including the tools described generally above may allow a user to restrict a search to specific content types such as RSS podcasts which may be recognized e.g. by presence of RSS with an MP3 or WAV attachment or other OPML links within the corpus of OPML files searched. The interface may be supported by a searchable database of OPML content which may in turn be fed by one or more OPML spiders that seek to continually update content either generally or within a specific domain i.e. an enterprise a top level domain name a computer or any other domain that can be defined for operation of a spider. The OPML generated by an OPML search engine may also be searchable permitting e.g. recovery of lost links to OPML content.

It will be appreciated that by storing an entire knowledge structure or entire portions thereof the tree structure may be navigated in either direction. That is a tree may be navigated downward in a hierarchy which is possible with conventional outlines as well as upward in a hierarchy which is not supported directly by OPML . Upward navigation becomes possible with reference to a stored version of the knowledge structure and the navigation system may include techniques for resolving upward references e.g. where two different OPML documents refer to the same object using explicit user selections pre programmed preferences or other selection criteria as well as combinations thereof.

Data services may include access to a database management system DBMS . In one aspect the DBMS may provide management of syndicated content. In another aspect the DBMS may support a virtual database of distributed data. The DBMS may allow a user such as a human or an automatic computer program to perform operations on a data feed references to the data feed metadata associated with the data feed and the like. Thus in one aspect a DBMS is provided for syndicated content. Operations on the data managed by the DBMS may be expressed in accordance with a query language such as SQL XQuery or any other database query language. In some embodiments the query language may be employed to describe operations on a data feed on an aggregate of data feeds or on a distributed set of data feeds. It should be appreciated that the data feeds may be structured according to RSS OPML or any other syndicated data format. In another aspect content such as OPML content may describe a relationship among distributed data and the data services may provide a virtual DBMS interface to the distributed data. Thus there is disclosed herein an OPML based database wherein data relationships are encoded in OPML and data are stored as content distributed among resources referenced by the OPML.

The data services may include database transactions. Each database transaction may include an atomic set of reads and or writes to the database. The transaction mechanism for the database transactions may support concurrent and or conditional access to the data in the database. Conditional access may support privacy security data integrity and the like within the database. The transaction mechanism may allow a plurality of users to concurrently read write create delete perform a query or perform any other operation supported by the DMBS against an RSS feed or OPML file either of which may be supported by the data in the database or support a database infrastructure. In one aspect the transaction mechanism may avoid or resolve conflicting operations and maintain the consistency of the database. The transaction mechanism may be adapted to support availability scalability mobility serializability and or convergence of a DBMS. The transaction mechanism may also or instead support version control or revision control. The DBMS may additionally or alternatively provide methods and systems for providing access control record locking conflict resolution avoidance of list updates avoidance of system delusion avoidance of scaleup pitfall and the like.

The data services may provide an interface to a DBMS that functions as a content source by publishing or transmitting a data feed to a client. The DBMS may additionally or alternatively perform as a client by accessing or receiving a data feed from a content source. The DBMS may perform as an aggregator of feeds. The DBMS may provide a syndication service. The DBMS may perform as an element in a service oriented architecture. The DBMS may accept and or provide data that are formatted according to XML OPML HTML RSS or any other markup language.

Semantics or semantic processing may include any functions or services associated with the meaning of content from the sources and may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Semantics may include for example interrelating content into a knowledge structure using for example OPML adding metadata or enriching current metadata interpreting or translating content and so forth. Semantics may also include parsing content either linguistically for substantive or grammatical analysis or programmatically for generation of executable events. Semantics may include labeling data feeds and items within feeds either automatically or manually. This may also include interpretation of labels or other metadata and automated metadata enrichment. Semantics may also provide a semantic hierarchy for categorizing content according to user specified constraints or against a fixed dictionary or knowledge structure. Generally any function relating to the categorization interpretation or labeling of content may be performed within a semantic layer which may be used for example by users to interpret content or by sources to self identify content. Categorization may be based on one or more factors such as popularity explicit user categorization interpretation or analysis of textual graphical or other content relationship to other items such as through an outline or other hierarchical description content type e.g. file type content metadata e.g. author source distribution channel time of publication etc. and so forth. Currently available tools for semantic processing include OPML dictionaries thesauruses and metadata tagging. Current tools also include an array of linguistic analysis tools which may be deployed as a semantic service or used by a semantic service. These and other tools may be employed to evaluate semantic content of an item including the body and metadata thereof and to add or modify semantic information accordingly.

It will be understood that while OPML is one specific outlining grammar any similar grammar whether XML based ASCII based or the like may be employed provided it offers a manner for explicitly identifying hierarchies and or relationships among items within a document and or among documents. Where the grammar is XML based it is referred to herein as an outlining markup language.

Semantics may be deployed for example as a semantic service associated with a syndication platform or service. The semantic service may be for example a web service a service in a services oriented architecture a layer of a protocol stack a client side or server side application or any of the other technologies described herein as well as various combinations of these. The semantic service may offer a variety of forms of automated semi automated or manual semantic analysis of items of syndicated content including feeds or channels that provide such items. The semantic service may operate in one or more ways with syndicated content. In one aspect the semantic service may operate on metadata within the syndicated content as generally noted above. The semantic service may also or instead store metadata independent from the syndicated content such as in a database which may be publicly accessible or privately used by a value added semantic service provider or the like. The semantic service may also or instead specify relationships among items of syndicated content using an outlining service such as OPML. In general an outlining service outlining markup language outlining syntax or the like provides a structured grammar for specifying relationships such as hierarchical relationships among items of content. The relationship may for example be a tree or other hierarchical structure that may be self defined by a number of discrete relationships among individual items within the tree. Any number of such outlines may be provided in an outline based semantic service.

By way of an example of use of a semantic service a plurality of items of syndicated content such as news items relating to a corporate entity may be aggregated for presentation as a data feed. Other content such as stored data items may be associated with the data feed using an outline markup language so that an outline provided by the semantic service includes current events relating to a corporate entity along with timely data from a suitable data source such as stock quotes bond prices or any other financial instrument data e.g. privately held securities stock options futures contracts and also publicly available data such as SEC filings including quarterly reports annual reports or other event reports. All of these data sources may be collected for a company using an outline that structures the aggregated data and provides pointers to a current source of data where the data might change such as stock quotes or SEC filings . Thus an outline may provide a fixed structured and current view of the corporate entity where data from different sources changes with widely varying frequencies. Of course other content such as message boards discussion groups and the like may be incorporated into the outline along with relatively stable content such as a web site URL for the entity.

Syndication may include any functions or services associated with a publish subscribe environment and may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Syndication may include syndication specific functions such as publication subscription aggregation republication and more generally management of syndication information e.g. source date author and the like . One commonly employed syndication system is RSS although it will be appreciated from the remaining disclosure that a wide array of enhanced syndication services may provided in cooperation with or separate from an RSS infrastructure.

Infrastructure may include any low level functions associated with enhanced syndication services and may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Infrastructure may support for example security authentication traffic management logging pinging communications reporting time and date services and the like.

In one embodiment the infrastructure may include a communications interface adapted for wireless delivery of RSS content. RSS content is typically developed for viewing by a conventional full sized computer screen however users increasingly view web content including RSS feeds using wireless devices such as cellular phones Personal Digital Assistants PDAs wireless electronic mail devices such as Blackberrys and the like. In many cases content that is suitable for a normal computer screen is not appropriate for a small screen for example the amount of text that can be read on the screen is reduced. Accordingly embodiments of the invention include formatting RSS feeds for wireless devices. In particular embodiments of the invention include methods and systems for providing content to a user including taking a feed of RSS content determining a user interface format for a wireless device and reformatting the RSS content for the user interface for the wireless device. In embodiments the content may be dynamically reformatted based on the type of wireless device.

In embodiments tags from an RSS feed can be used to feed a template such as an XML enabled template that further modifies the RSS feed based on the nature of a wireless device. For example the abstract of an RSS feed can be delivered in a shortened format such as identifying and delivering the first sentence of the abstract. An RSS feed can also be broken up into sub segments and a user can be provided with a link within the feed for requesting additional sub segments or additional portions of the feed thus permitting a user to control content delivery where for example the user has a bandwidth constrained or display constrained device. In embodiments the link may be interactive and may be activated or manipulated by a user with a control such as a button thumbpad touchscreen dial button or stylus.

In embodiments an RSS feed may further comprise inserting a phone number into the feed wherein interacting with the phone number on a cellular phone or other telecommunications capable device initiates a telephone call. The telephone call could be to a content source so as to allow a user to hear a voice rendition of the content of the RSS feed to hear related content such as programming related to the RSS feed to initiate a transaction such as related to the content of the RSS feed to request a particular type of additional information to allow the user to subscribe to the feed or the like.

In embodiments the RSS feed may include a time related component such as a schedule for the delivery of additional content. In embodiments the time related component may be fed to a calendar task list or related facility thus setting an appointment related to the time related component in a user s electronic calendar such as on a handheld device or on a conventional personal computer or laptop computer.

In embodiments an RSS feed may be provided with a separate layer of security that is associated with a security facility of a wireless device. For example an RSS feed may be encrypted so that it may only be read by a specific type of wireless device a specific wireless device or on a specific wireless device only after entry of a password that is issued to a known user of that wireless device. In embodiments security may be associated with a location facility of the wireless device such as GPS cellular triangulation or the like so as to allow a user to access an RSS feed only if the user is physically located in a particular place. For example a user attending a live concert or other event might be permitted to view an RSS feed about the concert but other users might be excluded from that content creating a secure new media channel for event attendees.

In embodiments a user interface for a wireless or handheld device may be customized to include menus that specifically relate to RSS content. For example an interface may be provided with a separate RSS menu icon drop down selection or the like for allowing a user to place such a device in an RSS mode. Within an RSS mode initiated by an RSS menu option a user may be provided with options to take actions related to RSS such as subscribing to feeds selecting feeds from a set of feeds prioritizing feeds selecting feeds as favorites or the like. In embodiments an RSS mode may include a menu item for each of or a subset of the components of the RSS schema. For example a menu icon drop down item or the like may allow a user to select and view the title of an RSS feed the abstract text the authors or other content. In embodiments the user interface of a wireless or handheld device may have an RSS search icon menu or screen that returns RSS results in response to entry of a keyword. In embodiments results may be returned that include commercial and non commercial result sets which may be distinguished on the screen such as by screen location by an icon that identifies them as such or by another indicator of the distinction such as color font underlining italics boldface type highlighting or the like.

In another aspect the infrastructure may include improved pinging systems. The only current form of network service in an RSS environment is a primitive system of pings such as those provided by weblogs.com that permit users to track changes and updates to content. When a producer updates its RSS output file a message is sent to a central file server. When consumers want to know if there are updated RSS outputs from particular sources they go to the central file and see if there is a recent message from the producer of choice rather than retrieving the RSS source directly. When new content is available the consumer may send an electronic request directly to the producer s output file and read the contents into the consumers local files archive or repository. The infrastructure for an enhanced syndication system may provide improved pinging systems. For example a central server may be secure. In such a system each request for a ping may carry an encryption based key for the requestor. Responses to that requestor which may be verified for example with reference to a trusted third party or using some other technique may be time bound with constraints on start times stop times frequency quotas or the like. In another embodiment the requester may simply use a unique identification number. Pings may be subscription based so that a for fee pinger may be used more frequently than a free pinger. Thus there is disclosed herein a secure pinger for use in an RSS system. Also disclosed herein is a managed pinger which may limit ping responses according to subscription levels frequency or any other suitable criteria.

The infrastructure may more generally provide traffic management services including but not limited to real time monitoring of message latency traffic and congestion and packet quality across a network of end to end RSS exchanges and relationships. This may include real time monitoring of special traffic problems such as denial of service attacks or overload of network capabilities. Another service may be Quality of Service management that provides a publisher with the ability to manage time of sending of signaling messages for pingers time of availability of the signaled about messages and unique identifiers which apply to the signaling message and the signaled about message or messages. This may also include quality of service attributes for the signaled about message or messages and criteria for selecting end user computers that are to be treated to particular levels of end to end quality of service. This may be for example a commercial service in which users pay for higher levels of QoS.

It will be generally appreciated that the arrangement of layers and interfaces may vary however in one embodiment syndication may communicate directly with sources while the applications may communicate directly with users . Thus in one aspect the systems described herein enable enhanced syndication systems by providing a consistent framework for consumption and republication of content by users . In general existing technologies such as RSS provide adequate syndication services but additional elements of a syndication system such as social networking and semantic content management have been provided only incrementally and only on an ad hoc basis from specific service providers. The functions and services described above may be realized through for example the services oriented architecture described below with reference to and or any of the markup languages described below with reference to .

In one example a model of an end to end content syndication system for e.g. RSS OPML or other content may include the following elements convert structure store spider pool search filter cluster route and run. Conversion may transform data bi directionally between application specific or database specific formats and the syndication or outlining format. Structure may be derived from the content such as a knowledge structure inherent in interrelated OPML outlines or metadata contained in RSS tags. Storage may occur locally on a user device or at a remote repository. Spiders may be employed to search repositories and local data on user devices to the extent that it is made publicly available or actively published. Pools of data may be formed at central repositories or archives. Searches may be conducted across one or more pools of data. Filters may be employed to select specific data feeds items within a data feed or elements of an OPML tree structure. Specific items or OPML tree branches may be clustered based upon explicit search criteria inferences from metadata or content or community rankings or commentary. Routing may permit combinations among content from various content sources using e.g. web services or superservices. Such combinations may be run to generate corresponding displays of results. Other similar or different combinations of elements from the broad categories above may be devised according to various value chains or other conceptual models of syndication services.

More generally well defined interfaces between a collection of discrete modules for an established value chain may permit independent development improvement adaptation and or customization of modules by end users or commercial entities. This may include configurations of features within a module which might be usefully shared with others for example as well as functional changes to underlying software.

For example an author may wish to use any one or more of a number of environments to create content for syndication. By providing a module with a standardized interface to RSS posting converters may be created for that module to convert between application formats and an RSS ready format. This may free contributors to create content in any desired format and with suitable converters readily transform the content into RSS ready material. Thus disparate applications such as Microsoft Word Excel and Outlook may be used to generate content with the author leveraging off features of those applications such as spell checking grammar checking calculation capabilities scheduling capabilities and so on . The content may then be converted into RSS material and published to an RSS feed. As a significant advantage users may work in an environment in which they are comfortable and simply obtain needed converters to supply content to the RSS network. As a result contributors may be able to more efficiently produce source material of higher quality. Tagging tools may also be incorporated into this module or some author module to provide any degree of automation and standardization desired by an author for categorization of content.

As another example appropriate characterization of RSS material remains a constantly growing problem. However if tagging occurs at a known and predictable point in the RSS chain e.g. within a specific module then any number of useful applications may be constructed within or in communication with that module to assist with tagging. For example all untagged RSS posts may be extracted from feeds and pooled at a commonly accessible location where one or more people may resolve tagging issues. Or the module may automatically resolve tagging recommendations contributed by readers of the item. Different rules may be constructed for different streams of data according to editorial demands or community preferences. In short maintaining a separate tagging module or fixing the tagging function at a particular module within the chain permits a wide array of tagging functions which may be coordinated with other aspects of the RSS chain.

In another aspect a well defined organization of modules permits improved synchronization or coordination of different elements of the modules in the RSS chain. Thus for example centralized aggregators may be provided to improve usability or to improve the tagging of content with metadata where a combination of lack of standards and constantly evolving topics has frustrated attempts to normalize tagging vocabulary. By explicitly separating tagging from content visibility of tagging behavior may be improved and yield better tag selection by content authors. Similarly search techniques mapping and exploration may be fully separated from indexing pre processing to permit independent improvements in each.

A well established backplane or other communications system for cooperating RSS modules or other data feeds may enable a number of business processes or enterprise applications particularly if coupled with identity security role management which may be incorporated into the backplane or various modules connected thereto to control access to data feeds.

For example a document management system may be provided using an enhanced RSS system. Large companies particularly document intensive companies such as professional services firms including accounting firms law firms consulting firms and financial services firms employ sophisticated document management systems that provide unique identifiers and metadata for each new document created by employees. Each new document may also for example be added to an RSS feed. This may occur at any identifiable point during the document s life such as when first stored when mailed when printed or at any other time. By viewing the RSS feed with for example topical filters an individual may filter the stream of new documents for items of interest. Thus for example a partner at a law firm may remain continuously updated on all external correspondence relating to SEC Regulation FD compliance with Sarbanes Oxley or any other matter of interest. Alternatively a partner may wish to see all documents relating to a certain client. Similarly a manager at a brokerage house may wish to monitor all trades of more than a certain number of shares for a certain stock. Or an accountant may wish to see all internal memoranda relating to revisions to depreciation allowances in the federal tax code. An enhanced RSS system may provide any number of different perspectives on newly created content within an organization.

Other enterprise wide applications may be created. For example a hospital may place all prescriptions written by physicians at the hospital into an RSS feed. This data may be viewed and analyzed to obtain a chronological view of treatment.

In one aspect functions within the conceptual framework may include a group of atomic functions which may be accessed with a corresponding syntax. Arrangements of such calls into higher level more complex operations may also be expressed in a file such as an OPML file an XML file or any other suitable grammar. Effectively these groups of instructions may form programmatic expressions which may be stored for publication re use and combination with other programmatic expressions. Data for these programmatic expressions may be separately stored in another physical location in a separate partition at a location of the instructions or together with the instructions. In one aspect OPML may provide a grammar for expression of functional relationships and RSS may provide a grammar for data. Thus the same complex operation may be re executed against different data sets or against data in a syndicated feed that periodically updates. Thus in one aspect an architecture is provided for microprocessor styled programming across distributed data and instructions.

In general the service requester which may be any of the clients described above discovers services and receives service descriptions through an exchange with the service broker using a suitable syntax such as the Web Services Description Language WSDL . The service provider publishes service descriptions to the service broker also using a syntax such as WSDL. The service requester uses a service through communications with the service provider using a transport protocol such as Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP . An SOA may include any number of requesters brokers and providers . Additionally a number of protocols and standards may be employed to orchestrate the deployment of services in an SOA . In a web services embodiment the Web service protocol stack is employed to define locate implement and interact with Web services. In general this includes four main areas service transport XML messaging service description and service discovery. Service transport transports messages among network applications using protocols such as HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP File Transfer Protocol FTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP and more recently the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol BEEP . XML messaging encodes messages in a common XML format using for example XML RPC SOAP and REST. The service description is used to describe the public interface for services typically using WSDL as noted above. Service discovery may use WSDL along with Universal Description Discovery and Integration UDDI which provides a platform independent XML based registry for public Internet listings.

An SOA architecture may be used for example in an enhanced syndication system to relate metadata in an item of content to services that are available from the registry. Thus for example a publicly available registry may provide among other things a number of viewers for graphical images. An RSS item may refer to an image source such as an MRI image in a medical record from a hospital and may specify a viewer for the source image that is available through the registry. In operation a client with appropriate permission to view the image also as managed e.g. through the metadata for the enhanced syndication system may retrieve the appropriate viewer service from the registry and apply the viewer to view the source image. In this example viewers may be freely provided or may be licensed and made available through the registry on a fee per use basis or some other licensing terms. Similarly the image source may be made available in various resolutions each available under a different fee structure. In other embodiments textual sources may be available in various forms ranging from a title and biographical data to an abstract to the full text of the source. Thus the SOA platform may be used to resell content from an RSS archive using viewer or access privilege services made available through the registry. Other aspects such as identity and affiliation as well as verification of these may be made available as services in the SOA .

Services which may be for example any of the services described above with reference to may employ a variety of standards protocols and programming languages to interact meaningfully with the data . This includes for example the use of programming tools that permit program logic to be deployed in e.g. Java Windows Perl PHP C C and so on. This also includes parsing processing and database access using e.g. data binding mapping XML components into native formats of various programming languages Document Object Model DOM a programming interface for manipulation of XML HTML as program objects Simple API for XML SAX another API for XML documents XSL a stylesheet expression language XSL Transformations XSLT a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents XML Path Language XPATH a language for referring to parts of XML documents XSL Formatting Objects XSL FO an XML vocabulary for formatting semantics and a variety of tools for queries and other access to commercial databases. Further presentation may be provided using e.g. XHTML CSS XSL FO SMIL WSUI and a host of other presentation tools. Services may also employ various other XML oriented tools for messaging metadata and web services including SOAP XML RPC RDF UDDI WSDL and the like. Other specifications such as the Voice eXtensible Markup Language VoiceXML Security Services Markup Language S2ML and OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language SAML provide special purpose grammars for specific functions. In general these tools in various combinations permit a relatively arbitrary deployment of functions as services on top of content structured using XML grammars.

The services may interact with data through one or more established grammars such as a secure markup language a finance markup language WSDL the Outline Programming Markup Language OPML or other markup languages based upon XML which is a species of the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML . The interaction may be also or instead through non XML grammars such as HTML which is a species of SGML or other formats . More generally a wide array of XML schemas has been devised for industry specific and application specific environments. For example XML.org lists the following vertical industries with registered XML schemas including the number of registered schemas in parentheses all of which may be usefully combined with the systems described herein and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety Accounting 14 Advertising 6 Aerospace 20 Agriculture 3 Arts Entertainment 24 Astronomy 14 Automotive 14 Banking 10 Biology 9 Business Reporting 2 Business Services 3 Catalogs 9 Chemistry 4 Computer 9 Construction 8 Consulting 20 Customer Relation 8 Customs 2 Databases 11 E Commerce 60 EDI 18 ERP 4 Economics 2 Education 51 Energy Utilities 35 Environmental 1 Financial Service 53 Food Services 3 Geography 5 Healthcare 25 Human Resources 23 Industrial Control 5 Insurance 6 Internet Web 35 Legal 10 Literature 14 Manufacturing 8 Marketing PR 1 Math Data Mining 10 Multimedia 26 News 12 Other Industry 12 Professional Service 6 Public Service 5 Publishing Print 28 Real Estate 16 Religion Retail 6 Robotics AI 5 Science 64 Security 4 Social Sciences 4 Software 129 Supply Chain 23 Telecommunications 26 Translation 7 Transportation 10 Travel 4 Waste Management Weather 6 Wholesale and XML Technologies 238 .

Syndication services described in more detail below may operate in an XML environment through a syndication markup language which may support syndication specific functions through a corresponding data structure. One example of a currently used syndication markup language is RSS. However it will be appreciated that a syndication markup language SML as described herein may include any structure suitable for syndication including RSS RSS with extensions RSS RSS without certain elements RSS RSS with variations to elements RSS or various combinations of these e.g. RSS RSS . Furthermore an SML may incorporate features from other markup languages such as a financial markup language and or a secure markup language or may be used in cooperation with these other markup languages . More generally various combinations of XML schemas may be employed to provide syndication with enhanced services as described herein in an XML environment. It will be noted from the position of SML in the XML environment that SML may be XML based SGML based or employ some other grammar for services related to syndication. All such variations to the syndication markup language as may be usefully employed with the systems described herein are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure and may be used in a syndication system as that term is used herein.

According to the foregoing there is disclosed herein an enhanced syndication system. In one aspect the enhanced syndication system permits semantic manipulation of syndicated content. In another aspect the enhanced syndication system offers a social networking interface which permits various user interactions without a need to directly access underlying syndication technologies and the details thereof. In another aspect a wide variety of additional services may be deployed in combination with syndicated content to enable new uses of syndicated content. In another aspect persistence may be provided to transient syndicated content by the provision of a database or archive of data feeds and particularly the content of data feeds which may be searched filtered or otherwise investigated and manipulated in a syndication network. Such a use of a syndication system with a persistent archive of data feeds and items therein is now described in greater detail.

The syndication markup language or the syndication markup language in combination with other supporting markup languages and other grammars including but not limited to RSS OPML XML and or any other definition grammar syntax or format either fixed or extensible all as described in more detail below may support syndication related communications and functions. Syndication communications may generally occur through an internetwork between a subscriber and a publisher with various searching filtering sorting archiving modifying and or outlining of information as described herein.

Two widely known message definitions for syndicated communications are RSS 2.0 RSS and the Atom Syndication Format Draft Version 9 Atom as submitted to the IETF on Jun. 7 2005 in the form of an Internet Draft . A syndication message definition as used herein will be understood to include these definitions as well as variations modifications extensions simplifications and the like as described generally herein. Thus a syndication message definition will be understood to include the various XML specifications and other grammars described herein and may support corresponding functions and capabilities that may or may not include the conventional publish subscribe operations of syndication. A syndication definition may be described in terms of XML or any other suitable standardized or proprietary format. XML for example is a widely accepted standard of the Internet community that may conveniently offer a human readable and machine readable format. Alternatively the syndication definition may be described according to another syntax and or formal grammar.

For purposes of establishing a general vocabulary and not by way of limitation components of syndicated communications are now described in greater detail.

A message instance or message may conform to a message definition which may be an abstract typed definition. The abstract typed definition may be expressed for example in terms of an XML schema which may without limitation comprise XML s built in Document Type Definition DTD XML Schema RELAX NG and so forth. In some cases information may lend itself to representation as a set of message instances which may be atomic and may be ordered and or may naturally occur as a series. It should be appreciated that the information may change over time and that any change in the information may naturally be associated with a change in a particular message instance and or a change in the set of message instances. A data feed or data stream may include a set of messages. In an RSS environment a message instance may be referred to as an entry. In an OPML environment the message instance may be referred to as a list. More generally a message may include any elements of the syndication message definition noted above. Thus it will be appreciated that the terms list outline message item and the like may be used interchangeably in the description of enhanced syndication systems herein. All such meanings are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure unless a more specific meaning is expressly indicated or clear from the context. A channel definition may provide metadata associated with a data feed and a subscription request may include a URI or other metadata identifying a data feed and or data feed location. The location may without limitation comprise a network address indication of a network protocol path virtual path filename and any other suitable identifying information.

A syndication message definition may include any or all of the elements of the following standards and drafts all of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference RSS 2.0 Atom Syndication Format as presented in the IETF Internet Draft Version 9 of the Atom Syndication Format OPML 1.0 XML Signature Syntax as published in the W3C Recommendation of 12 Feb. 2002 the XML Encryption Syntax as published in the W3C Recommendation of 10 Dec. 2002 and the Common Markup for Micropayment per fee links as published in the W3C Working Draft of 25 Aug. 1999 .

A syndication definition may also include elements pertaining to medical devices crawlers digital rights management change logs route traces permanent links also known as permalinks time video devices social networking vertical markets downstream processing and other operations associated with Internet based syndication. The additional elements may without limitation comprise the following clinical note ClinicalNote biochemistry result BiochemistryResult DICOM compliant MRI image DCMRI keywords Keywords license License change log ChangeLog route trace RouteTrace permalink Permalink time Time shopping cart ShoppingCart video Video device Device friend Friend market Market downstream processing directive DPDirective set of associated files FileSet revision history RevisionHistory revision Revision branch Branch merge Merge trunk Trunk and symbolic revision SymbolicRevision . Generally in embodiments the names of the elements may be case insensitive.

For example the contents of the clinical note element may without limitation comprise a note written by a clinician such as a referral letter from a primary care physician to a specialist. The contents of the biochemistry result element may without limitation comprise indicia of total cholesterol LDL cholesterol HDL cholesterol and or triglycerides. The contents of the DICOM compliant MRI image element may without limitation comprise an image file in the DICOM format. The content of the keyword element may without limitation comprise a word and or phrase associated with the content contained in the message wherein the word and or phrase may be processed by a Web crawler. The content of the license element may without limitation comprise a URL that may refer to a Web page containing a description of a license under which the message is available. The content of the change log element may without limitation comprise a change log. The content of the route trace element may without limitation comprise a list of the computers through which the message has passed such as a list of received headers analogous to those commonly appended to an e mail message as it travels from sender to receiver through one or more SMTP servers. The content of the permalink element may without limitation comprise a permalink such as an unchanging URL. The content of the time element may without limitation comprise a time which may be represented according to RFC 868. The content of the shopping cart element may without limitation comprise a representation of a shopping cart such as XML data that may comprise elements representative of quantity item item description weight and unit price. The content of the video element may without limitation comprise a MPEG 4 encoded video file. The content of the device element may without limitation comprise a name of a computing facility. The content of the friend element may without limitation comprise a name of a friend associated with an author of an entry. The content of the market element may without limitation comprise a name of a market. The content of the downstream processing directive element may without limitation comprise a textual string representative of a processing step such as and without limitation Archive This that ought to be carried out by a recipient of a message.

Thus in general a syndication definition as that term is used herein describes a message format that enables Internet syndication operations as well as other complementary or separate operations. A message as that term is used herein may be associated with a feature of RSS may be associated with a feature of Atom may be associated with a feature of OPML may be associated with a micropayment may be associated with electronic commerce may be associated with a representation of medical information may be associated with the representation of public information may be associated with the representation of private information may be associated with the representation of protected information may be associated with a tag for a crawler may be associated with versioning and or a change log may be associated with a digital signature may be associated with basic authentication may be associated with digest authentication may associated with encryption may be associated with a license term may be associated with a route trace may be associated with a permalink may be associated with an enclosure or file attachment may be associated with an indication of time or a timestamp may be associated with e commerce may be associated with searching may be associated with filtering may be associated with clustering may be associated with a database may be associated with security may be associated with video may be associated with a device may be associated with a user interface may be associated with a rule may be associated with non syndication technologies may be associated with social networking may be associated with a vertical market may be associated with downstream processing may be associated with semantic processing and or may be associated with a source.

A message as described herein may include consist of or be evaluated by one or more rules or expressions referred to collectively in the following discussion as expressions that provide descriptions of how a message should be processed. In this context the message may contain data in addition to expressions or may refer to an external source for data. The expression may be asserted in a variety of syntaxes and may be executable and or interpretable by a machine. For example an expression may have a form such as that associated with the Lisp programming language. Although an expression may commonly be represented as what may be understood as a Lisp like expression or Lisp list for example a b c this particular representation is not necessary. An expression may defined recursively and may include flow control branching conditional statements loops and any other aspects of structured object oriented aspect oriented or other programming languages. For example and without limitation it should be appreciated that information encoded as SGML or any species thereof such as and without limitation XML HTML OPML RSS and so forth may easily be represented as a Lisp like expression and vice versa. Likewise data atoms such as and without limitation a text string a URL a URI a filename and or a pathname may naturally be represented as a Lisp like expression and vice versa. Again by way of illustration and not limitation any representation of encoded information that can be reduced to a Lisp like expression may be an expression as that term is used herein.

In one aspect a message processor as described herein may include a hardware and or software platform for evaluating messages according to any of the expressions described above. The message processor may reside for example on the server computer or client computer as described above. The processing may without limitation include the steps of read evaluate execute interpret apply store and or print. The machine for processing an expression may comprise software and or hardware. The machine may be designed to process a particular representation of an expression such as and without limitation SGML or any species thereof. Alternatively the machine may be a metacircular evaluator capable of processing any arbitrary representation of an S expression as specified in a representation of an expression.

Generally a message may include or be an expression. In other embodiments the expression evaluation process may itself be syndicated. In such an embodiment interpretations i.e. evaluations of a message may vary according to a particular evaluation expression even where the underlying message remains constant such as by filtering concatenating supplementing sorting or otherwise processing elements of the message or a plurality of messages. Different evaluation expressions may be made available as syndicated content using the syndication techniques described generally herein.

The message may specify presentation e.g. display parameters or include expressions or other elements characterizing a conversion into one or more presentation formats.

In embodiments the message may include an OPML file with an outline of content such as and without limitation a table of contents an index a subject and associated talking points wherein the talking points may or may not be bulleted an image a flowchart a spreadsheet a chart a diagram a figure or any combination thereof. A conversion facility which may include any of the clients or servers described above may receive the message and convert it to a specified presentation format which may include any proprietary or open format suitable for presentation. This may include without limitation a Microsoft PowerPoint file a Microsoft Word file a PDF file an HTML file a rich text file or any other file comprising both a representation of content and a representation of a presentation of the content. The representation of content may comprise a sequence of text an image a movie clip an audio clip or any other embodiment of content. The representation of the presentation of the content may include characteristics such as a font a font size a style an emphasis a de emphasis a page relative position a screen relative position an abstract position an orientation a scale a font color a background color a foreground color an indication of opacity a skin a style a look and feel or any other embodiment of presentation as well as combinations of any or all of the foregoing. In a corresponding method a message may be received and processed and a corresponding output file may be created that represents a presentation format of the received message. In various aspects the message may include an OPML file with references to external data. During processing this data may be located and additionally processed as necessary or desired for incorporation into the output file.

In one embodiment the system may include an OPML to PowerPoint converter that traverses one or more OPML outlines and converts the OPML outline into a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation having a structure representative of the structure embodied in the outline. This may include for example one or more introductory slides with title author creation date and other information. This may also include one or more slides summarizing the contents of the entire PowerPoint document based upon the top level contents of the outline in the OPML document. Sub categories may be similarly previewed in the PowerPoint document with slides that list all elements of an outline at one hierarchical level followed by a number of slides addressing each element in greater detail. Additionally items such as graphics charts tables audio clips word documents and the like that are contained on leaf nodes of the OPML outline may be rendered within the PowerPoint slides to capture some or all of the multi media content represented within the OPML outline. Similarly the system may convert a PowerPoint presentation into an OPML outline and may either employ the explicitly outlined structure of the PowerPoint presentation or infer structure from the arrangement or titles of slides within the PowerPoint document.

In one aspect the systems described herein may be used to scan historical feed data and locate relevant data feeds. For example filters may be applied to historical feed data to identify feeds of interest to a user. For example by searching for words such as optical and surgery in a universe of medical feeds a user may locate feeds relevant to optical laser surgery regardless of how those feeds are labeled or characterized by other users or content providers. In another complementary application numerous filters may be tested against known relevant feeds with a filter selected according to the results. This process may be iterative where a user may design a filter test it against relevant feeds apply to other feeds to locate new relevant feeds and repeat. Thus while real time or near real time filtering is one aspect of the systems described herein the filtering technology may be used with historical data to improve the yield of relevant material for virtually any topic of interest.

Another advantage of filtering historical data is the ability to capture transient discussions and topics that are not currently of interest. Thus a user interested in the 1996 U.S. Presidential campaign may find little relevant material on current data feeds but may find a high amount of relevant data in the time period immediately preceding the subsequent 2000 campaign. Similarly an arbitrary topic such as Egyptian history may have been widely discussed at some time in the past while receiving very little attention today. The application of filters to historical feeds may provide search functionality similar to structured searching of static Web content. Thus there is disclosed herein a time or chronology oriented search tool for searching the contents of one or more sequential data feeds.

In another aspect the filters may be applied to a wide array of feeds such as news sources to build a real time magazine dedicated to a particular topic. The results may be further parsed into categories by source. For example for diabetes related filters the results may be parsed into groups such as medical and research journals patient commentaries medical practitioner Weblogs and so forth. The resulting aggregated data feed may also be combined with a readers forum editor s overview highlights of current developments and so forth each of which may be an additional data feed for use for example in a Web based real time magazine or a new aggregated data feed.

In general the filter may apply any known rules for discriminating text or other media to identified data feeds. For example rules may be provided for determining the presence or absence of any word or groups of words. Wild card characters and word stems may also be used in filters. In addition if then rules or other logical collections of rules may be used. Proximity may be used in filters where the number of words between two related words is factored into the filtering process. Weighting may be applied so that certain words groups of words or filter rules are applied with different weight toward the ultimate determination of whether to filter a particular item. External references from an item e.g. links to other external content either the existence of links or the domain or other aspects thereof may be used to filter incoming items of a data feed. External links to a data feed or data item may also be used so as to determine relevance by looking at the number of users who have linked to an item. This process may be expanded to measure the relevance of each link by examining the number of additional links produced by the linking entity. In other words if someone links to a reference and that user has no other links this may be less relevant than someone who links to the reference and has one hundred other links. This type of linking analysis system is provided for example by Technorati.

Filters may apply semantic analysis to determine or approximate the tone content or other aspects of an item by analyzing words and word patterns therein. Filters may also examine the source of an item such as whether it is from a .com top level domain or an .edu top level domain. The significance of a source designation as either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of passing through the filter may of course depend on the type of filter. Additionally synonyms for search terms or criteria may be automatically generated and applied alongside user specified filter criteria.

Metadata may be used to measure relevance. Data feeds and data items may be tagged with either subject matter codes or descriptive words and phrases to indicate content. Tags may be provided by an external trusted authority such as an editorial board or provided by an author of each item or provider of each data feed. These and any other rules capable of expression through a user interface may be applied to items or posts in data feeds to locate content of interest to a particular user.

As noted above a user may also share data feeds aggregated data feeds and or filters with others. Thus in general there is provided herein a real time data mining method for use with data feeds such as RSS feeds. Through the intelligent filtering enabled by this data feed management system automatically updating information montages tailored to specific topics or users may be created that include any number of different perspectives from one to one hundred to one thousand or more. These real time montages may be adapted to any number of distinct customer segments of any size as well as to business vertical market applications.

In another aspect filters may provide a gating technology for subsequent action. For example when a number of items are identified meeting a particular filter criterion specific automated actions may be taken in response. For example filter results or some predetermined number of filter results may trigger a responsive action such as displaying an alert on a user s monitor posting the results on a Weblog e mailing the results to others tagging the results with certain metadata or signaling for user intervention to review the results and status. Thus for example when a filter produces four results an e mail containing the results may be transmitted to a user with embedded links to the source material.

It will be appreciated that search results will be improved by the availability of well organized databases. While a number of Weblogs provide local search functionality and a number of aggregator services provide lists of available data feeds there does not presently exist a consumer level searchable database of feed contents at least nothing equivalent to what Google or Altavista provide for the Web. As such one aspect of the system described herein is a database of data feeds that is searchable by contents as well as metadata such as title and description. In a server used with the systems described herein the entire universe of known data feeds may be hashed or otherwise organized into searchable form in real time or near real time. The hash index may include each word or other symbol and any data necessary to locate it in a stream and in a post.

One useful parameter that may be included for searching is age. That is the age of a feed the age of posts within a feed and any other frequency data may be integrated into the database for use in structured user searches and the filters discussed in reference to .

As a further advantage data may be retrieved from other aggregators and data feeds on a well defined schedule. In addition to providing a very current view of data streams this approach prevents certain inconsistencies that occur with currently used aggregators. For example even for aggregator sites that push notification of updates to subscribers there may be inconsistencies between source data and data feed data if the source data is modified. While it is possible to renew notification when source material is updated this is not universally implemented in aggregators or Weblog software commonly employed by end users. Thus an aggregator may extract data from another aggregator that has not been updated. At the same time an aggregator or data source may prevent repeated access from the same location e.g. IP address . By accessing all of this data on a regular schedule that is acceptable to the respective data sources and aggregators and storing the results locally the server described herein may maintain a current and accurate view of data feeds. Additionally feeds may be automatically added by searching and monitoring in real time in a manner analogous to Web bots used by search engines for static content.

In another aspect a method of selling data feed services is disclosed herein. In this method RSS data which is actually static content in files may be serialized for distribution according to some time base or time standard such as one item every sixty seconds or every five minutes. In addition data may be filtered to select one item of highest priority at each transmission interval. In another configuration one update of all items may be pushed to subscribers every hour or on some other schedule in an effective batch mode. Optionally a protocol may be established between the server and clients that provides real time notification of new items. A revenue model may be constructed around the serialized data in which users pay increasing subscription rates for increasing timeliness with premium subscribers receiving nearly instantaneous updates. Thus in one aspect a data feed system is modified to provide time based data feeds to end users. This may be particularly useful for time sensitive information such as sports scores or stock prices. In another embodiment the end user feed may adhere to an RSS or other data feed standard but nonetheless use a tightly controlled feed schedule that is known to both the source and recipient of the data to create a virtual time based data feed.

Additional profile information such as user interests preferences and biographical data may also be optionally provided. This data and other user profile data may be used to target advertising associated with data feed sites or content. Thus a data feed management system is described herein in which ads are delivered that are of value to customers. In addition to self signaling through profile data the system may apply customer filtering behavioral analysis or any other analytic tools as applied to the user s feed selection and displayed posts to select appropriate advertisements for that user. The revenues from advertisements may be shared in a number of ways and may include shares of revenue to for example the operator of the data feed management system an intermediary that places an ad that results in a sale and or individual or institutional content providers who contributed to the relevant data feed audience.

In another aspect of the systems described herein feeds posts and or filters may be clustered and shared in a number of ways as described above. Particular configurations may be branded and sold as a value added service. Thus for example Warren Buffet s data feed selection and filtering may be of great interest to investors bankers and financiers. These selections may be sold to users who wish to see data feeds in the same manner as Warren Buffet. Similarly someone may be interested in the writings and readings of Martha Stewart Bill Clinton Bill O Reilly Bill Gates or Bill Belichick. Any of these individuals may brand and resell their selection of data feeds and design and use of filters. Similarly commercial political or other institutional entities may present an official RSS feed identity. This may be provided for free for promotional purposes such as promotion of a political party in a campaign or promotion of a seasonal sale event by a retailer. Similarly topical selections may be promoted by trade groups or individuals. For example a biotech or patent filter may be promoted by a patent law firm. In these applications the service sold or promoted may include either the filters and selections themselves which an end user may then modify or use as desired or an aggregated feed of results from the filters and selections without identification of the underlying criteria. Access to such an aggregated feed may be controlled through password based protection to a resulting Weblog or using the identity based RSS technology described above.

In one embodiment a user may either for a fee as described above or for free such as among a group of friends or interest based community of bloggers share not just search results but rules for finding those search results. In another application of this technology a buddy list or other community may share aggregator configurations and other data. In another application of this a recommendation engine may identify popular and successful search and filtering criteria that match a particular use profile.

In one aspect there is described herein a systematic approach to managing data feeds in an integrated and possibly Web based user interface. In a first step the user may process feeds including for example searching for analyzing and selecting feeds. In a second step a user may process posts within a feed such as by filtering the posts as described above. In a third step the aggregated and filtered results may be displayed to the user. This systematic approach also readily accommodates subsequent processing of the resulting items such as by branding the technique for locating those items or by permitting sharing of the technique both of which are described above. Additional processing steps may also include for example aggregating results into an aggregated feed or any of the other processing steps identified in the foregoing detailed description.

A number of enhanced syndication systems providing security are now described in greater detail. While a number of examples of RSS are provided as embodiments of a secure syndication system it will be appreciated that RDF Atom or any other syndication language or OPML or other structured grammar including more generally the S definition set out above may be advantageously employed within a secure syndication framework as set forth herein.

Security may impact a number of features of a syndication system. For example a data stream system may use identity assignment and or encryption and or identity authentication and or decryption by public and private encryption keys for RSS items and similar structured data sets and data streams. The system may include notification of delivery as well as interpretation of delivery success failure notification of possible compromise of the end to end security system non repudiation and so on. The identity assignment and encryption as well as the authentication and decryption as well as the notification and interpretation may occur at any or multiple points in the electronic communication process some of which are illustrated and described below. A secure RSS system may be advantageously employed in a number of areas including but not limited to general business health care and financial services. Encryption may be employed in a number of ways within an RSS system including encryption and or authentication of the primary message notification to a sender or third party of receipt of messages interpretation of delivery method and processing of an RSS item during delivery.

In item level encryption of the primary message an item from an RSS source or similar source may be assigned an identifier which may be secure such as a digital signature and or encrypted with a key such as a private key in a Public Key Infrastructure PKI and transmitted to a recipient who may use a corresponding public key associated with a particular source to authenticate or decrypt the communication. A public key may be sent to the recipient simultaneously or in advance by a third party or collected by the recipient from a third party source such as a public network location provided by the source or a trusted third party. In other embodiments an intended recipient may provide a public key to a sender so that the sender which may be a content source aggregator or other RSS participant may encrypt data in a manner that may only be decrypted by the intended recipient. In this type of exchange the intended recipient s public key may similarly be published to a public web location e mailed directly from the recipient or provided by a trusted third party.

In tag level encryption of fields of data delimited within a message similar encryption techniques may be employed. By using tag level encryption security may be controlled for specific elements of a message and may vary from field to field within a single message. Tag level encryption may be usefully employed for example within a medical records context. In a medical environment and in numerous other environments it may be appropriate to treat different components of e.g. a medical record in different ways. Thus while a medical record of an event may include information from numerous sources it may be useful to compose the medical record from various atomic data types each having unique security and other characteristics associated with its source. Thus the medical record may include treatment objects device objects radiology objects people objects billing objects insurance objects diagnosis objects and so forth. Each object may carry its own encryption keys and or security features so that the entire medical record may be composed and distributed without regard to security for individual elements.

In a notification system a secondary or meta return message may be triggered by receipt authentication and or decryption of the primary message by a recipient and sent by the recipient to the message originator or to a third party to provide reliable notification of receipt.

In interpretation of delivery information a sender or trusted intermediary may monitor the return message s and compare these with a list of expected return messages based for example on the list of previously or recently sent messages . This comparison information may be interpreted to provide information as to whether a communication was successful and in the case of communication to more than one recipient to determine how many and what percentage of communications were successful. The receipt of return messages that do not match the list of expected messages may be used to determine that fraudulent messages are being sent to recipients perhaps using a duplicate of an authentic private key and that the security service may have been compromised.

In another aspect a series of encryption keys may be used by the source and various aggregators or other intermediaries in order to track distribution of items through an RSS network. This tracking may either use notification and interpretation as described herein or may simply reside in the finally distributed item which will require a specific order of keys to properly decrypt some or all of the item. If this system is being used primarily for tracking rather than security encryption and decryption information may be embedded directly into the RSS item either in one of the current fields or in a new field for carrying distribution channel information e.g. . . . .

In another aspect the message may be processed at any point during distribution. For example the communication process may include many stages of processing from the initial generation of a message through its ultimate receipt. Any two or more stages may be engaged in identity assignment and or encryption as well as the authentication and or decryption as well as notification and or interpretation. These stages may include but are not limited to message generation software such as word processors or blog software message conversion software for producing an RSS version of a message and putting it into a file open to the Internet relay by a messaging service such as one that might host message generation and RSS conversion software for many producers relay by a proxy server or other caching server relay by a notification server whose major function is notifying potential recipients to pull a message from a source and services for message receiving and aggregating and filtering multiple messages message display to recipients and message forwarding to further recipients.

In another aspect a message may include one or more digital signatures which may be authenticated with reference to for example the message contents or a hash or other digest thereof in combination with a public key for the purported author. Conversely a recipient of a digitally signed item may verify authenticity with reference to the message contents or a hash or other digest version thereof in combination with a private key of the recipient.

In general the pools may be physically deployed on any data storage resource accessible through the network . This may include for example a database web server FTP file peer to peer file sharing resource secure database RSS channel or any other technology platform and system s suitable for receiving storing and transmitting data. It will be understood that in various embodiments each pool may be a logically and or physically separate storage location permitting either distributed management of common data e.g. for purposes of security redundancy or the like or centralization of distributed data e.g. for more efficient processing .

While a pool may be realized as for example a conventional RSS channel that receives and publishes items other pools may collect and present data in more complex ways. For example the pool management infrastructure may include a pool server or other system that either physically or logically sits between the user community and the pools and brokers interactions. The infrastructure may control access to the pools through a security system that includes for example any of the security features or systems described herein. In one embodiment the infrastructure may include a firewall router switch or similar device that physically resides between the pools and the user community . The pools may also or instead be partially or completely encrypted. The infrastructure may also provide attention management by tracking user interactions with various pools and or data within pools. In one aspect the infrastructure may provide anonymity either to users accessing the pools or to the pools or sources of data therein. In another aspect the infrastructure may provide formatting functions. As with anonymity formatting may operate in either direction i.e. by formatting user requests in a manner suitable for presentation to the pools or that creates a logical appearance of pools to differently structured underlying data sources or by formatting any responsive output from a pool. In one aspect the infrastructure may provide a dynamic content system that provides different views of pools according to a user type user identity or the like. In another aspect the infrastructure may provide search capabilities including structured searching and or spidering for content within the pools . It will be understood that while depicted as a single centralized server the pool management infrastructure may include any number of servers and or other network devices or systems that cooperate and or operate autonomously to create a data pool environment for users in a community .

The community may include any user or group of users that access data in pools either by providing data to the pools extracting data from the pools or both. This may include social groups professional groups commercial entities and so forth.

Using a pool management infrastructure sources of data may be treated as populations and managed as an integrated but evolving ecology or topology so that new forms of data can be added to the ecology continually so that sets of data in particular forms can be added to and or modified and so that uses of data and combinations of data can be continually invented and implemented within the ecology without reworking the existing structure and applications.

In one example the pool management infrastructure may enable secure management of a pool system and any associated data data formats and pool enclosures. The infrastructure may for example provide an administrative dashboard that includes an administrative interface to a secure access control system an administrative interface to a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures system and an administrative interface to the update notification availability and spider system provided by vendor . The infrastructure may also or instead include an administrative interface for configuring the data converter and router systems to put data into pools controls for a spider to control extraction and search filter cluster and routing to pools and web services. It may also include interfaces for directing web services to take input directly from particular pools to take input from the spider and other routing machines and to output service results to particular pools and services in particular formats.

The pool data storage format may be XML RSS OPML Atom RDF or any other data format. Pool content may be managed using a file directory system maintained by an operating system such as Linux Unix and Microsoft Windows. Pool content including enclosures to pool items may be provided by a client side central data store for XML RSS and related formats included in the Microsoft Vista operating system for personal computers.

Sources of data for pools may include any source s of digital data. For example in a medical context sources may include machines such as x ray MRE PET CT and other medical imaging devices as well as blood diagnostic inventory management ordering scheduling billing human output fed programs such as notes on medical record diagnostic forms and or process fed outputs such as the result of a cross functional medical second opinion process. In an enterprise suitable sources may include document management systems electronic mail systems instant messaging systems billing systems accounting systems human resources systems computer network traffic management systems and so forth.

These sources may also or instead output data to the data pools in a common format such as XML RSS OPML Atom RDF or any other common format. Data sources may also send their customary outputs through a format converter that outputs a common format and a data pool router that directs the output to an appropriate data pool or pools.

In one aspect data pools may be viewed as folders open to inspection or more formally reading and writing by a spider or other search mechanism. A spider may for example use remote web service calls to poll each pool or a pool interface provided by the pool management infrastructure to determine if a given pool is accessible or if it has had any changes to its contents and to read and write pool content. A spider may be deployed to monitor and manage a total topology of pools and any data contained therein.

Spiders may collect information from pools and enable the shared management of information across pools by allowing diverse information to be retrieved assembled and analyzed in order to for example create a virtual medical record by combining data elements that are held in different pools of diagnostic test results physician notes and the results of processes. Pools also may be accessed for quality control for example to review x ray s and diagnostic findings for a random sample of patients in order to ascertain the quality of diagnosis.

Pools may employ a variety of security measures to achieve conditional access privacy security and the like. Access to pools can be controlled for individuals e.g. according to identity or role spiders web services and so forth. Access control may be implemented for example using third party products such as Cisco Secure Access Server or Microsoft Products such as Windows Active Directory or the Windows Server Network Access Protection NAP policy enforcement platform built into the Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server operating systems.

CVE or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures analysis and remediation is a process through which network assets are analyzed to determine vulnerability to hacking data theft unauthorized access and the like. The US government in cooperation with The MITRE Corporation MITRE and computer software and hardware vendors monitors and inventories vulnerabilities and exposures. A number of companies provide software hardware and consulting services to identify and address these risks on a network such as an enterprise or corporate network. In an enterprise pool management system CVE may be applied to data pools and any supporting infrastructure. Pools using conditional access and security systems such as those that assure compliance with HIPPA health data protection standards may be assessed using CVE techniques. In addition to identifying common vulnerabilities and threats a security system may accommodate automated or semi automated interventions to secure data pools and infrastructure. In one embodiment CVE enabled security for pools may be provided with suitable adaptations to commercially available products and services such as the NetClarity Auditor Enterprise system.

In general syndicated data outlined data or more generally any structured or unstructured data may be stored in pools which provides a useful conceptual model for interaction with syndicated content and other data as well as a specific term to refer to data sources and or repositories that interact with the systems described herein. Aspects of the present invention relate to pooling syndicated information. Pools may contain information relating to information that was found in data streams. A pool may represent for example information from one or more data streams at particular times or from particular sources. For example a financial market may produce a stream of data relating to trades made during a trading session and a pool of data extracted from the stream may be created for subsequent use. As another example medical information may be produced by a medical device and the medical device information may be pushed into a data stream. The medical information from the data stream may be extracted from the stream and placed in a pool. As another example all information related to a particular topic person entity or the like may be acquired from a range of different data streams and placed into a corresponding pool.

Pools of data can be merged with other pools of data to form larger pools e.g. to combine things of like file type semantic meaning subject matter etc. . In embodiments pools may be drained and in doing so new data streams may be created. An example would be streaming a series of offers to sell goods or services securities etc. at a given price out of a pool of such offers. In embodiments the data stream may be buffered until relevant decision points are achieved.

In embodiments a filter may be associated with a pool of data. A pool of data may be created from unfiltered data e.g. an unfiltered data stream and then over time the pool can be run through filters to produce a cleaner more relevant pool of data. The filter could be a semantic filter a collaborative filter a logical filter or a human filter such as a community that validates the presence of content in the pool . E.g. a pool could contain good movies that are monitored by a community.

In embodiments pools may be linked to other pools so that one pool spills into the other e.g. a pool of data that takes input from another pool upon occurrence of an event such as availability of a resource for processing for example when a resource becomes available to process an incoming message requesting help from a software help desk and is handed into a pool of similar requests for handling by someone who is responsible for that type of request . Pools of data can evaporate that is data items can be made to expire from the pool either based on age or based on the right conditions e.g. if a price of a security drops low enough then limit orders may be triggered if time passes an option can expire etc. . Pools may be filled by different sources a main source as well as secondary sources or streams that augment the main source streams .

An aspect of the systems described herein relates to the filtering of contents such as syndicated feeds and the like. Syndication content filters may be used in connection with hardware software firmware in a chip set or in another configuration. In embodiments a user may publish or subscribe to a syndication feed on his desktop system or mobile communication facility e.g. PDA cellular phone and the like and the syndication feed may be filtered through a syndication filter. In embodiments the syndication filter is a mechanism adapted to define the syndication feed. For example a device may be set to collect certain feeds through a hardware enabled syndication filter.

The client may also or instead include a software based syndication filter . The software syndication filter may execute as a background process associated with network traffic or be integrated into an operating system or an application executing on the CPU and it may run from volatile or non volatile memory not shown associated with the client . The software syndication filter may provide for example the functions of the hardware syndication filter or syndication filter described above. The CPU may call a software syndication filter routine from the data repository in the process of monitoring a syndication feed. For example in the process of receiving a syndication feed the CPU may call the routine to monitor analyze manipulate or otherwise interact with the feed.

Filters may operate on various data types within syndicated messages. Syndicated data feeds e.g. RSS or syndicated OPML may contain device configuration settings images video data broadcast rating information and the like. Syndicated feeds may be available in or contain many different formats e.g. tables databases documents multimedia web content formats metadata electronic mail and so forth and they may contain information from a variety of sources such as electronic mail online content or web content. A feed may contain various types of information for signal type filters such as radio and TV broadcast content rating security information and the like. The feed or messages within a feed may include data for suitably enabled devices to change a mode of operation using different modes to suit different content client devices and so forth. In an organization users on different IP addresses may desire different information content from the same source a hardware device may have a syndication filter incorporated to automatically filter and or sort the syndicated data to the proper IP address es . Syndication applications may be capable of automatically performing an analysis on received feeds to filter IP URL addresses viruses attached files in email weblog feeds email instant messages web content phone calls TV channels or various analog and digital signals. A filter may apply different rules to different types of enclosures or attachments. Thus for example a filter may apply a first set of rules to MP3 attachments a second set of rules to OPML attachments a third set of rules to metadata and a fourth set of rules to textual content within a message.

In general a filter may operate to pass certain information and or block certain information. In a data feed environment filters may employ a variety of techniques to filter a feed. The filter may operate on various aspects of the feed. This may include for example textual content metadata attachments external references either from an item or to an item and so forth. A filter may employ rules algorithms look up tables keywords Boolean expressions heuristics and the like. A filter may operate on specific fields within an item such as source name date title and so forth. Numerous devices may incorporate syndication filtering as described generally above. A number of non limiting examples are provided below. Some of these examples show a device that implements filtering of syndicated content. Other examples show conventional filters that send or receive filter related data in a syndicated format. Various combinations and modifications of the examples and these general principles will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure.

Filtering may be embedded into a network router. Network routers may have syndication filter capability incorporated into the network router firmware or may have a syndication capable chip or chip set incorporated into at least one of the network router processors or circuit boards. The syndication capable network router may be able to recognize that a received file is a syndication data feed and may make routing decisions based on the syndication data feed contents. The syndication capable network router may be able to route data to IP addresses on a network based on the syndication data or information contained in the header and body of a network packet or by information in the syndication feed. The syndication feeds may originate from IP addresses within the router network or may be received from outside the router network such as from the internet. For example if a number of users received financial data from a common syndication source but the different users were interested in different parts of the financial data the syndication capable router may route portions of the syndicated data according to user criteria. Thus for example the router may handle data from a syndicated source of mortgage data by routing trading data for secondary mortgage markets to one user e.g. a bond fund manager current mortgage rates to a second user e.g. a consumer and mortgage qualification data to a third user e.g. a retail bank .

The syndication capable network router may be able to route syndication data feeds for at least one of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data. The syndication capable router may be capable of routing syndication data feeds to a particular IP address on the network based on the syndication data contained in the feed. In an embodiment the syndication capable network router may be able to filter spam adware or email by comparing an originating IP or URL to known spam adware or email addresses or to look for key words within the incoming packets. The syndication capable network router may be able to filter block route or permit at least one of online information sources such as news newspapers web magazines academic papers government court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analyses discussions of current events internet media and advertisements by IP address URL syndication content or packet heading. The syndication capable network router may be able to filter block route or permit at least one of internet based web pages weblogs websites and web popups by IP address URL syndication content or packet heading.

The syndication capable network router may be adapted to filter block route or permit at least one of network packet traffic IP address MAC address and VoIP network packets based on originating source destination address or syndication content of the packet. The syndication capable network router may be adapted to filter block route or permit packets based on at least one of a syndication digital signature syndication password or key and syndication identity certificate of the packets.

Filtering may be embedded into a firewall. A software or hardware firewall may incorporate syndication filtering. The firewall may be adapted to recognize syndicated content and further adapted to filter block or permit the syndicated content according to filter parameters. Filter parameters may be configured through an administrative interface to the firewall such as a web based user interface. The syndication capable firewall may be adapted to filter block or permit at least one of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data based on the syndication application syndication incoming port syndication incoming IP syndication IP address or syndication content. The syndication capable firewall may be adapted to filter or block at least one of spam adware or email addresses based on a syndication source IP address a syndication source URL or content. The syndication capable firewall may be adapted to filter or block at least one of internet based news newspapers web magazines academic papers government court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analyses discussions of current events internet media and advertisements by syndication IP address syndication URL syndication application syndication port syndication content or syndication heading. The syndication capable firewall may be adapted to filter or block at least one of internet based web pages weblogs websites and web popups by syndication IP address syndication URL syndication application syndication port syndication content or syndication heading. The syndication capable firewall may be adapted to filter or block network packet traffic or IP addresses based on originating or destination syndication address.

Filtering may be embedded in a virus protection application. The virus protection application may incorporate syndication filtering capabilities. The syndication capable virus protection application may inspect attachments or enclosures to syndicated content or may analyze the syndicated content itself for malicious instructions or the like. The syndication capable virus protection application may be adapted to identify filter and or block viral syndication content and or attachments in one or more of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data electronic mail internet based online news newspapers web magazines academic papers government court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analyses discussions of current events internet media advertisements web pages weblogs and websites based on known syndication virus content.

A filter may be deployed as a syndication attachment or enclosure filter. This filter may be adapted to locate other syndicated content or sources of content. RSS data feeds for example may contain content or attachments that contain additional syndication data. A syndication attachment file filter may scan messages from a syndicated data feed for attachments that may contain other syndication data in which a user has interest. For example a medical data feed may have information that a user is interested in but may also contain an attachment with additional medical information. The syndication attachment file filter may be able to determine if the attachment contains information that may be of interest to the user and either keep or omit the attachment from the received data feed. The filter may filter syndication attachments using at least one of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data based on syndication content. The filter may filter attachments to other media types. For example the filter may scan electronic mail for syndication attachments and apply various filtering rules to any such attachments. As another example the filter may scan the content of a word processing document for references to syndication sources and or messages.

A filter may operate locally or remotely. For example a client device may filter a weblog or collection of weblogs or aggregator output to remove items that are not of interest. In another aspect a remote weblog reader may filter content and transmit the filter output to a client device. A weblog filter may filter feeds according to at least one of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data based on user defined syndication content. The weblog filter may filter feeds according to source using such as for example filters based on internet based online news newspapers web magazines academic papers government court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analyses discussions of current events internet media and advertisements.

Websites may broadcast syndication data files that may contain a brief description of the content of the website. A syndication web content filter may be able to read the syndication data file content to block access to a certain site based on any user defined feature. For example a parent wanting to block a certain type of websites from a child may be able to define the type of site to block. The parent may define key words phrases ratings and so forth to look for in the syndication data file. The filter may block web sites according to one or more of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data based on the user defined syndication web site rating. The syndication web content filter may be adapted to block web sites containing at least one of internet based online news newspapers web magazines academic papers government court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analyses discussions of current events internet media and advertisements based on the user defined syndication web site rating. The syndication web content filter may be able to block at least one of web pages weblogs websites and web browser content based on the user defined syndication web site rating.

An instant messaging IM application may incorporate a filter. The syndication capable instant message application may be adapted to filter syndication data feeds that may be received from another instant message application either within an instant message or within an attachment or file shared through an instant messaging system.

An anti phishing program may incorporate a filter. Internet phishing generally takes the form of a request for user information for the purposes of identity theft credit card information or monetary payments. These requests may be sent to a user by email instant message or from the web and may incorporate a syndication data feed. A syndication phishing filter may be able to block syndication phishing requests based on the syndication content and definition by the user.

A search engine may incorporate a filter. An Internet search engine may contain a filter adapted to identify sites that provide syndication data feeds responsive to a user s definition. For example a user may be able to define a search for medical information on heart valves to get only a listing of syndication data feed sites with this information. The filter may employ any of the parameters or filtering techniques described above.

A security appliance may incorporate a filter. Security appliances operate as reverse proxy devices positioned between any type of client and a server to act as an additional layer of security for communications. A security appliance may perform checks for viruses spam phishing or other undesired files sent to a server. The server may be any kind of server such as an application server email server or web server. A syndication capable security appliance may be adapted to analyze syndication data feeds to determine the syndication data feed content and make decisions to block or pass the syndicated content onto the server. The filter may employ any of the parameters or filtering techniques described above. The syndication capable security appliance may be adapted to filter at least one of unwanted syndication network packet traffic syndication IP addresses and syndication MAC addresses from entering a server. The syndication capable security appliance may be adapted to filter at least one of unwanted syndication digital signatures syndication passwords or keys and syndication identity certificates from entering a server.

Database applications e.g. Oracle may incorporate syndication filter capabilities. Syndication data files may have the same structure as XML using tags to indicate the beginning and end of information sections of the information or data. XML and syndication are becoming increasingly popular for holding data because of their small size and data types they may contain. A syndication capable database application may be adapted to search and filter data from syndication data sources in addition to the same abilities for tables and databases. The syndication capable database application may be adapted to filter at least one of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data or business data from syndication sources based on user or application requirements.

Filters may be integrated into an enterprise application. Enterprise applications may be adapted to search and filter data from across corporate or local area networks as well as wide area networks including the Internet. Enterprise data may be obtained from other applications and or databases deployed within the enterprise and the enterprise application may apply suitable connections and converters to read the data and or convert the data to a common format. A syndication capable enterprise application may also be adapted to access data in syndication data files and syndication data feeds at local and or remote locations. The syndication capable enterprise application may be adapted to use a search engine to locate syndication data feeds on the internet that may have desired data based on a user s definition. The syndication capable enterprise application may be adapted to filter syndication data feeds or syndication data files based upon one or more of personal data financial data medical data enterprise data business data. More generally the syndication capable enterprise application may employ any of the filtering parameters and techniques described above.

A filter may provide semantic processing to process data according to semantic content or meaning. The filter may be applied to data in tables databases and syndication metadata and it may permit searching or handling of syndicated content based upon user provided semantic parameters. The semantic filter may employ any of the filtering parameters or techniques described above.

A filter may provide encryption processing to permit filtering of encrypted data. The filter may employ user provided keys to decrypt syndicated content for further filtering and other processing. The filter may also or instead provide encryption processing to permit filtering of data according to encryption characteristics such as encryption type availability of public keys and so forth. The encryption filter may employ any of the filtering parameters or techniques described above.

A filter may provide caller ID filtering. The filter may identify and extract caller information from a cellular phone wired telephone wireless telephone VoIP telephone or other telephonic device. Information may for example be published to a data feed or forwarded for other processing. In another aspect the filter may identify and extract telephone numbers and other contact information from a data feed. The caller ID filter may employ any of the filtering parameters or techniques described above.

A filter may provide content filtering. A channel blocking system may be provided for a device to manage access to broadcast e.g. radio or television or other transmissions. The transmission may be accompanied by content ratings or other semantic data that may be employed by the channel blocking system to restrict availability at a receiving device according to user preferences. In one aspect the ratings may be provided as a syndicated feed. In another aspect the transmissions may be processed to derive a feed of characteristic information which may in turn be applied by the channel blocking system to dynamically restrict access according to current content and any user provided constraints. The filter may be applied to one or more of a radio broadcast a television broadcast a satellite broadcast a satellite radio broadcast a cable television channel or the like. The filter may employ analysis including content analysis and analysis of digital signatures passwords keys or identity certificates and the like.

A filter may be associated with an analog to digital converter ADC a digital to analog converter DAC or a media coder decoder CODEC referred to generally as digital processors. In one embodiment characterizations of output such as sampling rate compression ratios frequency spectra and the like may be provided to a feed for transmission and processing along with the digital content. In another aspect a data feed may be provided to guide downstream processing of the digital or analog signal. A filter may be applied to sort select block or otherwise process associated media according to the data feed.

Similarly any digital filter including audio filters digital filters digital subscriber line filters line filters surface acoustic wave filters and the like may be adapted to receive syndicated data that provide operating parameters for the filter or it may be adapted to publish a feed of operational data. In an embodiment the syndication signal processing platform may be adapted to process at least one of an audio signal electronic signal analog signal digital signal and video signal using a syndication signal processing platform which uses a provided set of parameters from a syndication data file or syndication data feed.

Healthcare institutions including but not limited to hospitals short term care facilities long term care facilities outpatient treatment centers hospices nursing homes mental health facilities government facilities e.g. Veterans Affairs hospitals specialty clinics and the like must continually monitor a vast array of information to ensure the ongoing delivery of safe and effective clinical treatment all while operating in an increasingly restrictive fiscal environment. Central to a healthcare institution s ability to manage and maintain high quality care is information. Medical journals regularly report on numerous quality improvements needed in health care delivery such as minimizing the under use over use and or misuse of care minimizing clinical errors reducing costs and so forth. Approaches such as conformance to clinical standards total quality management outcomes measurement accreditation and accountability healthcare provider training and performance monitoring cost tracking and cost effectiveness analysis patient education infrastructure monitoring and others are all used to systematically measure analyze and optimize the healthcare delivery of institutions.

Healthcare institutions are responsible for continuous improvement in healthcare delivery. In order to assess such broad terms as quality and improvement standards are necessary as is the ability to obtain information enabling an institution to conduct periodic assessments of performance policy and procedure. This is essentially an ongoing audit of performance enabling a systematic appraisal of an institution. Conceptually the components of this audit may be thought of as i infrastructure e.g. physical equipment needs of an institution ii process what is done when how by whom etc. and iii outcomes what occurred how do these occurrences compare to standards other institutions etc. . Data recording information retrieval and analysis are requisite for a valid audit of institutional structure process and outcomes.

For example evidence based medicine has as its goal to assist health care practitioners patients and policymakers to make better decisions by basing clinical decisions on the best evidence available such as clinical studies panel reports the reports of accreditation bodies and the like. At its most basic the goal of evidence based medicine is to have healthcare providers base their decisions on the best empirical evidence available. As information is added to the collective medical evidence for example through new clinical studies evidence based medicine provides a means for getting this data to healthcare providers in order to provide a means for continuous learning and for improving care. However many healthcare providers may have problems acquiring the skills needed to conduct appropriate searches and review the relevant literature or to consult databases within the context of their daily work. Thus there is wide variation in the delivery of medical care and the quality of the care delivered. Greater access to clinical information should result in reduced morbidity and mortality within healthcare institutions. Syndication technologies may provide opportunities for providing evidence based data and many other types of healthcare data to healthcare providers in order to assist continually improving healthcare delivery.

Despite widespread interest in collecting and disseminating healthcare information and the billions of dollars spent on the infrastructure and training necessary to collect analyze disseminate and use that information much of institutional healthcare and associated data collection delivery lags far behind in technical sophistication efficiency and usefulness. Many institutions do not pursue systems for collecting information that may be used to improving healthcare delivery because the endeavor is simply too costly. Many institutions that do invest in such informational infrastructure often do so to meet only their own unique internal needs and circumstances. Thus the costly data collected and analyzed at great cost by one institution may be of little or no relevance to another institution due to the lack of congruence in the data needs of the two intuitions. The result may be very costly vertical information systems with minimal horizontal links.

For example following a series of clinical errors Hospital A may decide to implement a new information collection and analysis system for monitoring the treatment of cardiovascular patients within the institution. Data such as medication usage frequency of patient follow up referrals interventions etc. may all be collected as part of this program and most likely stored in a relational database from which reports may be derived and analyses made. Hospital B may also have a keen interest in these clinical data and collect similar fields in its own proprietary database. For purposes of comparison benchmarking patient mix analysis outcomes etc. it would be very useful and cost efficient for Hospitals A and B to be able to share their data in some anonymous manner. However suppose as is often the case that Hospitals A and B differ in many respects institutionally and have different uses to which they seek to put the data. Hospital A may have a different pharmaceutical formulary that Hospital B. Hospital A may record medication side effects as None Mild Moderate Extensive while Hospital B records side effects as Nausea Rash Increased Blood Pressure etc. Hospital A may not have a surgical program thus its patients must be referred to another institution for bypass surgery and so data regarding this treatment and its outcomes is not included in Hospital A s dataset. Conversely Hospital B may have extensive surgical programs all of which generate data that is of great interest and included in Hospital B s dataset. These inconsistencies do not entirely rule out the sharing of data between the institutions. For example it is possible that they could share information about medications that are prescribed at both institutions and so forth. Unfortunately minimal overlap coding differences and the like make such information sharing require extensive retrospective re formatting that further increases the cost of the data. Not surprisingly inter institutional comparisons other than those formalized in clinical trials are therefore uncommon. If instead institutions recorded and had access to syndicated healthcare information from which unique feeds could be tailored to individual institutional needs certain problems such as those of institutional intercommunication described above may be minimized with improvement of the usefulness and efficiency of health care information for institutions.

Effective institutional healthcare delivery may require several steps. First goals and quality standards must be defined and to the extent possible must be measurable. Second specific measurable indicators relating to those definitions must then be selected. Definitions may come from accrediting bodies third party insurers physician groups e.g. the AMA patient advocacy groups or set to standards and goals that are internal to a particular institution. Third data are collected. Data quality increases insofar as it is more accessible has greater validity and completeness and is relevant to the institutional goal s for which it is intended to serve. Fourth summary and or analyses of the data are provided. Finally data delivery must occur preferably in a manner consistent with the needs aptitudes and preferences of the data s end users.

Layered over this sequential data infrastructure are the domains of a healthcare institution each with a potentially unique set of circumstances impacting each step of the data infrastructure. For example conformance to clinical standards total quality management outcomes measurement accreditation and accountability healthcare provider training and performance monitoring cost tracking and cost effectiveness analysis patient education infrastructure monitoring and others may each share a core set of data needs but have additional data requirements not shared by the other domains. Syndicated data technologies may be useful for implementing the data processing steps described herein in a decentralized manner and enabling different institutional domains to interact with the information collected by the decentralized data infrastructure to systematically measure analyze and optimize the healthcare delivery of an institution s domain in the manner best suited to the unique goals of a particular domain of a healthcare institution.

Healthcare institutions must conform to standards of care in order to obtain accreditation maintain relationships with third party insurers and the like. A number of organizations publish and report on standards of care such as the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations JCAHO the National Committee for Quality Assurance NCQA and others. Some standards may refer to the management of a healthcare institutions e.g. maintaining records on the credentials of all staff physicians while others may be quite specific to a disease state and how to best treat it. NCQA s HEDIS 3.0 database includes measures to assess the effectiveness of care. JCAHO mandates that healthcare institutions collect data on performance and medical specialty organizations such as the American College of Cardiology may derive and publish best practices for a specific condition e.g. how to evaluate and treat new onset angina.

In particular clinical practice guidelines may provide a healthcare institution its physicians and other healthcare providers with information regarding the appropriate treatment of a wide variety of conditions. Practice guidelines incorporate the best scientific evidence with expert opinion and represent recommendations based on rigorous clinical research and soundly generated professional consensus. Guidelines may also be useful sources of comparative data if the guidelines are explicit and there is good scientific evidence to support the recommendations. For example there is good evidence to suggest that certain therapies should be administered within the first six hours following a myocardial infarction. This is a rigorously studied guideline and is widely accepted. Syndicated data may be used to disseminate this information to and within a healthcare institution as well as used to collect and disseminate information pertain to the institution s performance and conformance with the guideline. Accrediting institutions researchers and other interested parties may in turn aggregate this syndicated data across a clinical specialty geographic region and so forth to derive norms of care comparative studies and the like.

As in other industries healthcare institutions have found value in quality improvement techniques such as Total Quality Management TQM Continuous Quality Improvement CQI and other similar methods. TQM and CQI derive from management research on methods for measuring performance and using this information to continuously monitor systemic outcomes and improve the quality of services goods and the like. Systematic monitoring of clinical performance within a healthcare institution permits parties within the institution to receive information on their performance and make improvements where necessary and permits administrators to evaluate the institution s systems and processes at a macro level aggregating information on individuals performances within the institution.

For example healthcare administrators within an institution may be interested in improving the wait times in the Emergency Room. As part of a TQM CQI project data could be collected on each patient who visits the ER within a defined period of time this data could be combined with other useful information such as day of the week time of day of the visit injury causing the ER visit and so on. Once these data are aggregated and analyzed it may be possible to spot trends or problem areas that may be improved. Perhaps Friday nights are associated with particularly long wait times. This information might prompt administrators to increase staffing on these nights and so on. An effective TQM CQI project must have valid and reliable information that is readily available to the appropriate parties who may use this information to improve institutional healthcare delivery. Syndicated data may be used to interact with information associated with a TQM CQI project within a healthcare institution used to aggregate TQM CQI data for purposes of comparison summary and the like. Similar projects could record clinical errors events e.g. intubation required CPR administered morbidity mortality and so forth as part of a TQM CQI process to reduce error rates and improve patient safety. This syndicated data in turn could be aggregated at a city state or national level for the purposes of administrative decision making resource allocation accreditation and so forth.

Training healthcare providers and the monitoring the performance of providers at all levels are fundamental to a successful healthcare institution. However measurement in this domain is notoriously difficult. For example in many instances it is not meaningful to hold a single provider individually responsible for a patient s outcomes because a given patient s treatment is likely to be shared by several providers perhaps with different clinical specialties and different levels of training and even shared across healthcare institutions e.g. physician group office hospital home care etc. . As another example it is difficult to establish standards of competence for different training levels because trainees assimilate information and acquire skills at different rates throughout the prolonged often multiyear period of training.

Further complicating measurement in this domain is the case mix of patients in different hospitals. A provider working in a public hospital may see patients in a more advanced disease state than her cross town colleague working at a private hospital in an affluent neighborhood. The lower socioeconomic status of the public hospital s patients may be associated with a variety of comorbid disorders derived from socioeconomic deficiencies. For example in the public hospital there may be a high level of uninsured patients who do not as often visit physicians offices and delay seeking care when it is needed. Thus to compare the performance of the public and private hospital providers on a variable such as Lower Systolic Blood Pressure Ten Points within Three Months of First Consultation is not a valid comparison as it is confounded by the different case mix of the two institutions.

In spite of these difficulties measuring performance monitoring provider training and the like are necessary in order to identify areas that need improvement signal the accomplishment of goals and respond to the need for accountability. The steering committee of a healthcare institution must ensure that staff members receive proper training that this training is in evidence within individuals clinical practice and that it serves to maintain and or improve upon desired performance levels. In response to t information pertaining to training and performance institutional task forces may be formed to focus on specific staff competencies that appear weak. Systematic monitoring of healthcare providers training and performance within a healthcare institution permits parties within the institution to receive information on their performance and make improvements where necessary and permits administrators to evaluate the institution s systems and processes at a macro level aggregating information on individuals performances within the institution. Cross institutional data may also be collected permitting specialty organizations to monitor the training and credentialing process for their residents and fellows.

Syndicated data may be used to monitor providers training and performance within a healthcare institution in a more passive decentralize manner. For example whereas a traditional performance measurement project would very likely specify in advance variables to collect where and when to collect the data create a new database or dataset within a database and so on a syndicated data infrastructure could systematically tag institutional records for later interaction as part of performance monitoring but without having to a priori decide the specifics of all intended analyses. Training and performance parameters may also be provided to cross institutional organizations such as medical schools comprising a number of teaching hospitals or medical specialty organizations.

In addition to clinical effectiveness healthcare institutions must also continually demonstrate optimal fiscal management. Cost effectiveness studies cost benefit analysis and simple cost tracking are all tools used to measure the economic value of services provided by healthcare institutions. Cost effectiveness analyses have as their goal to describe the cost of obtaining health outcomes as a means for determining the appropriateness of various treatment options. For example a cost effectiveness study may seek to quantify the cost of three treatment options for a narrowed coronary artery medication angioplasty bypass surgery to obtain the same outcome such as Free of Myocardial Infarction. The study would then quantify the cost for each year that a patient on average is free from having a heart attack. More invasive procedures like bypass surgery may increase the number of years that a patient is free from heart attack as compared to pharmaceutical treatment alone but at a significantly higher cost. This information may then be aggregated with other data e.g. patient factors provider factors institutional factors that affect outcomes. Data like these are often used to determine the appropriate timetable for health screenings. For example it is likely that testing males every year from birth for prostate cancer would result in lessening the mortality from this disease to some slight degree. However so few men under age 35 have prostate cancer that testing all men under this age is not cost effective. Thus standards must be derived based in part on the balance between obtaining a desired outcome detect cancer and economic necessities keep the cost of each cancer detected below X . The result enables healthcare providers and administrators to balance the desire to meet treatment objectives with prudent fiscal management. Cost benefit analysis is another method for measuring the net benefit of an intervention but with costs and benefits both expressed in financial units. The data necessary for cost related analyses may be stored by a healthcare institution in a syndicated format for later interaction.

As with the cost effectiveness of clinical outcomes healthcare institutions must also gather information regarding the value of patient education programs. Patient education is intended among other things to improve compliance with treatment regimens and help patients to better understand and self manage their health. For example a healthcare institution may create a patient education program for cardiology patients that includes teaching patients how to recognize symptoms associated with an impending heart attack so that should such symptoms occur they are better able to contact healthcare personnel for help. As another example educational programs may improve patients compliance in taking their medications and adhering to a follow up care plan. As a further example patient education may improve clinical outcomes by improving communication between doctor and patient as patients learn how to discuss their symptoms with their physician ask important questions and clear up any misunderstanding they might have about their health condition. A healthcare institution may collect data relating to patient education programs and measurable clinical outcomes and store these data in a syndicated format for later use in evaluating the usefulness and cost benefit of the programs.

Contemporary medicine is heavily reliant upon the devices and physical plant of healthcare institutions to administer appropriate care. Complex medical devices and equipment require monitoring and maintenance in order to prevent device related clinical errors. Device related mistakes may be due to i device failures e.g. component failure ii external factors e.g. electrical surges or outages iii system errors e.g. improper training poor maintenance or iv operator error e.g. human misuse of a device . Device related data for example pertaining to device related error may be stored in a syndicated format. From these syndicated data for example it may be possible to create feeds that alert institutions to possible device related problems. Moreover For example institutions may record their device related data in a syndicated format that is shared with an overseeing body. The overseeing body may aggregate this information from a multitude of institutions and glean useful information on devices that seem to be associated with device failures that appear to be more difficult to use and thus have high operator error and so forth. This summary information could in turn be stored in a syndicated format and feed to institutions so that they may be better aware of current or potential device problems.

In embodiments healthcare institutions may interact with evidence based information such as medical research clinical trial findings case studies peer reviewed articles academic presentations and the like in a syndicated format to enable an institution to continually update its repository of evidence based medical knowledge via syndicated data obtained through an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel. The syndicated information may include full academic journal articles article abstracts customized article summaries clinic trial data clinical trial analyses published standards of care published clinical indicators for medications published indicators for interventions appropriateness scores for certain classes of clinical profiles and corresponding treatment options and the like. For example an institution engaged in a high volume cardiology practice may be able to subscribe to syndicated data feeds for particular research journals organizations and the like and receive regular updates on new clinical findings recommendations changes in standards of care and so forth.

In embodiments syndicated evidence based information such as medical research clinical trial findings case studies peer reviewed articles academic presentations and the like may be plotted displayed analyzed or the like and distributed to an RSS enabled client.

In embodiments syndicated evidence based information such as medical research clinical trial findings case studies peer reviewed articles academic presentations and the like may be associated with an application consisting of a client side program. As used in this application the client side program may be healthcare software and or an application. The client side program may be formatted to operate on client devices such as a desktop computer laptop computer pocket personal computer a cellular phone Blackberry personal digital assistant or other SMS text enabled device or the like.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to present syndicated evidence based information such as medical research clinical trial findings case studies peer reviewed articles academic presentations and the like may be associated with an aggregator to track updates.

An important component of improving a patient s health care experience is providing a medical practice setting that is efficiently and effectively managed. Inefficiencies may frustrate the patient in his or her encounter with the provider and may increase the costs in time and money to patient and provider alike. For example inefficient management of a patient s office visits diagnostic tests and therapeutic procedures may result in wasting the patient s time delaying appropriate treatments and carrying out interventions without adequate information. Similarly ineffective management may deprive a patient of needed services or may impose additional costs on patient or provider. For example ineffective management of relationships with third party payers may result in delay or denial of approval for medical services unnecessary out of pocket costs to patients and less than appropriate reimbursement to the health care provider.

Efficient and effective medical office management advantageously integrates systems governing the use of time the flow of information and the organization of business functions. Scheduling a procedure for example involves features of time management such as identifying appointment times that fit with the diagnostic plan e.g. mammogram scheduled before MRI and both tests completed before biopsy and that fit with the doctor s the patient s and the facility s availability. A time management protocol may be advantageously integrated with information management so that both doctor and patient can access the data derived from a sequence of tests in order to inform subsequent decisions. A time management protocol may also be advantageously integrated with business functions within the office. For example procedures should be scheduled only when proper approval has been obtained for third party reimbursement coverage. As another example patients should have access to information about the economic consequences of scheduling a particular medical procedure e.g. partial coverage for certain procedures or deductible levels that must be met before the scheduling takes place.

In the medical practice setting a number of users from different constituencies participate in time management systems information management systems and business management systems increasing the complexity of integrating these systems. For example doctors support staff patients and schedulers may all participate in decisions surrounding time use along with related institutions such as diagnostic centers and hospitals. As another example doctors patients clinical staff and back office staff may all help direct the flow of health care or practice management information along with external communities such as medical specialty organizations patient interest groups and service providers like accountants and lawyers. As a further example patients office staff physicians and third parties are all involved in decisions pertaining to certain business functions such as obtaining reimbursement for a particular procedure.

In more detail where reimbursement issues are involved for example the patient is concerned about whether the procedure will be covered by her health care insurance and about the amount of her co pay while the office staff is concerned about proper diagnosis and procedure coding and about the claim filing processes that a particular payer requires. The physician also concerned about accurate coding for diagnosis and treatment is further concerned about conforming to certain third party procedures for arranging appropriate coverage for a patient. Before surgery for example physicians may need to draft letters to the prospective payer requesting coverage or justifying their treatment decisions or physicians may need to document their diagnostic findings in a particular way. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art diagnoses may be identified by numeric codes for example those provided by the International Classification of Diseases ICD coding systems most recently revised as ICD 10 by Diagnostic Related Groups DRG codes and the like and procedures may be identified by numeric codes for example those provided by the AMA Current Procedure Terminology CPT coding system and the like. External institutions such as the federal Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS state based Medicaid organizations managed care organizations MCOs health maintenance organizations HMOs health care insurance indemnity plans and the like may further affect the reimbursement process by enacting changes in coding in preapproval procedures or in reimbursement schedules. Changes enacted by third parties may materially alter the behavior of patient physician or office staff with respect to reimbursement related business functions.

There is a constant interplay among systems and among constituencies in an office based medical practice. Reimbursement restrictions for a patient may impact for example what treatment she elects or which provider she sees. A patient thus may select a provider based on that provider s participation in the patient s health plan. But information management systems within a practice may sway the patient s original economically motivated decision. Thus systems that a practice provides for informing patients about their medical conditions and their treatment options may support a particular patient s decision to seek treatment within that practice even if those providers are outside her preferred provider network. As another example information systems may allow a patient to opt for a more cost effective treatment plan or a treatment plan that coincides with her health plan s reimbursement restrictions. A physician similarly may utilize information systems to learn about the reimbursement impacts of various treatment plans so that she adds an appropriate economic dimension to her discussion of the risks benefits and alternatives of a particular course of treatment. Reimbursement affects time management too. A patient may wish to schedule all the stages of a procedure within a calendar year so that she will only have to pay one year s deductible.

Furthermore communities of users may form loosely around a certain management issue and dissolve when the issue has resolved. Scheduling an operation commonly involves arranging a number of tests and office visits before surgery booking time in the operating room and determining the nature of post operative inpatient and or outpatient follow up. The scheduler bases these arrangements on patient availability physician availability and resource availability operating room intensive care facility hospital room personnel equipment and the like . The scheduler in the medical office the patient and the surgeon all form a loose community around the issue of arranging the procedure and its concomitants. After the surgery and related health care appointments and resources are all scheduled the community may dissolve. If problems in the original schedule arise the same community may reassemble or new different participants may join.

As the examples herein illustrate a medical practice is an open environment interacting with various external systems and institutions. Management of these interactions forms an important aspect of running an efficient and effective medical practice. Reimbursement specialists within medical practices for example must keep informed about changes in third party reimbursement regulations or procedures which may differ among payers and across time. Policy changes in CMS for example may likewise impact the reimbursement process within an office. A reimbursement specialist may increase efficiencies in claim processing by having ready and organized access to each payer s policies and procedures. As another example medical offices and physicians have constant interaction with the external systems comprising the legal system. A multitude of legal rules and regulations affect medical behavior. Reimbursement governed by diagnosis and procedure codes as mentioned herein takes place under an overarching legal scheme that strictly penalizes willful inaccuracies and claim fraud. Doctors office managers and legal advisors all share an interest in conforming the practice s reimbursement related behavior to this regulatory framework. As yet another example on call schedules for physicians belonging to a medical practice must intersect with hospital staff requirements for emergency service coverage. These schedules in turn are designed to be consistent with legal guidelines for medical malpractice risk management.

In certain embodiments physicians schedulers patients diagnostic facilities hospitals treatment centers and the like may interact with medical practice time management systems in a syndicated format via syndicated data obtained through an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel to enable more efficient and effective use of time for all constituents within a medical practice setting. The syndicated time management systems may include patient schedules facility schedules physician availability office appointment schedules and the like. Using an enhanced syndication system each user may periodically publish updated availability as a syndicated feed. Access to each user s feed may be controlled using a conditional access service. An aggregator may gather availability streams from the users and publish an event scheduling feed. This feed may for example include periods of common availability or may include requests for revisions to published availability. In another aspect each user may derive a daily weekly or monthly schedule using the scheduling information within that user s feed along with any appropriate filters. The schedule may be converted into a useful format for the user such as a word document HTML document or Microsoft Outlook calendar entries. In another aspect a user may process a scheduling feed to generate and publish a new feed of reminders based upon for example user preferences.

In embodiments the saving storing merging retrieval and publication of syndicated time management information through RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel may be associated with an application consisting of a client side program. The client side program may be formatted to operate on client devices such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a pocket personal computer a cellular phone Blackberry personal digital assistant or other SMS text enabled device or the like. The client side program may be an individual one such as a Palm Pilot scheduler or an enterprise one such as an integrated office practice scheduler and may use proprietary software or commercially available software such as Microsoft Outlook. As an example a physician may retrieve her schedule for any particular day on her Palm Pilot or Blackberry with real time updating.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to interact with the syndicated time management systems may be associated with an aggregator to track updates. A scheduler in a medical office for example can keep track of changing availability of appointment times in a consultant s office so that she can coordinate a patient s consultation appointment with arranging the tests that the patient needs before he sees the consultant.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to interact with syndicated time management systems may be associated with a content management system that may provide summaries of the syndicated data available dates associated with the syndicated data links to access the full non summarized data parameters associated with particular scheduling decisions and the like. For example an office scheduler who accesses a data summary indicating that a certain consultant is unavailable may retrieve full non summarized data that contains information about who will be covering for the consultant in his absence so that she can select one of the covering physicians to see the patient instead. Alternatively for example a patient may access the same data summary and full non summarized data about available consultants and he may perform further research on the consultants before informing the office manager which one s would be acceptable. The full non summarized data available from the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel may include for example information about each consultant s education and training areas of specialization academic affiliations and publications.

In embodiments patients providers office staff consultants hospitals diagnostic centers treatment facilities such as operating rooms and interventional radiology suites and specialized equipment vendors may interact with syndicated time management systems through the use of a RSS enabled application providing social networking. As an example an interventional cardiologist who has been consulted for a coronary diagnostic therapeutic angiography angioplasty that may involve stent placement may track the temporal progress of a patient s preliminary diagnostic tests to determine when the patient will be ready for the procedure. The office equipment manager may also track the patient s progress through the preliminary tests to be sure that the proper stent will be on hand for the procedure or that the proper stent is available just in time for the anticipated intervention. In like manner the equipment vendor providing stents may keep track of the cardiologist s inventory and map against upcoming scheduled procedures to be sure that the proper stent is available for each procedure. The cardiologist s office staff may track an as yet unscheduled angiography patient s overall temporal progress through his pre procedure appointments so that the staff allocates time in the angiography suite and arrange physician and nursing availability only after certain preliminary tests have been scheduled and their results obtained. Arranging the angiographic procedure for example may be delayed until a radionuclide scan for cardiac function has been performed. The cardiologist s office staff may wish to ensure operating suite availability for emergencies before scheduling an interventional angiography i.e. one with angioplasty and stent placement . To continue this example the primary care office staff in collaboration with the cardiologist s practice management system may interrogate other syndicated practice time management systems to arrange multidisciplinary follow up for the angiography patient s cardiovascular disease including setting up dietician consultations cardiac rehabilitation exercise programs concurrent disease management e.g. diabetes or hypertension education and treatment programs and the like.

In embodiments patients providers office staff consultants hospitals diagnostic centers treatment facilities and specialized equipment vendors may interact with syndicated time management systems through the use of a RSS enabled application providing a user interface for viewing data records and the like. For example a client may in response to user input such as clicking on a date in a calendar format in the user interface retrieve the underlying item from the content source as indicated by an arrow . The underlying item may include data about a test result for a scheduled diagnostic procedure that has been completed or tracking information that shows how the data pertaining to a diagnostic test is being processed. For example a tissue sample may be provided with a bar code or other identifier that allows it to be tracked through the laboratory. Syndicated information about its path through the laboratory may be available as the sample progresses through the laboratory. A client who clicks on a calendar date in the user interface may learn that the tissue sample obtained on that calendar date was received in the pathology lab on the same date and was examined by the pathologist on the same date by frozen section but has not yet been examined by permanent section. The user interface may allow the client to follow the sample s progress through the diagnostic process so that he is notified when the pathologist dictates the final report on the sample or so that a copy of the pathologist s report is transmitted to the client when available.

In embodiments patients providers office staff consultants hospitals diagnostic centers treatment facilities and specialized equipment vendors may interact with syndicated time utilization management systems through the use of a RSS enabled application providing a media viewer. For example a client who clicks on a calendar date corresponding to the date of a patient s XRay CT scan MRI echocardiogram angiogram ultrasound and the like may obtain the corresponding images as still images or as video images. In certain embodiments the media viewer may include an image management program permitting for example three dimensional reconstruction of images template planning for prosthetic reconstruction or for hardware construction. An orthopedic technician for example may use a template program superimposed upon the media viewer that allows him to order appropriate implants based on diagnostic images of a patient s fracture. As another example the radiologist using the media viewer to view a mammogram performed on a certain date may access an image database to retrieve the patient s previous mammograms for comparison and may thereafter compare them electronically through use of a comparator program or algorithm.

As yet another example a physician who has read the pathology report on a particular tissue sample may click on links to images of the specimen obtained during its microscopic examination. The media viewer for the microscopic images of the specimen may include links to tissue sample reference images so that the physician may compare the specimen image with the image of a normal specimen. An additional program may be available within the media viewer to compare features of the sample with normal histological features to highlight pathological diagnoses permitting for example comparison with the dictated pathology report. In such an example a diagnostic image recognition program may point out on the tissue specimen image areas where tumor cells have invaded the tissue itself or have spread into lymphatics or blood vessels along with areas where the tumor cells remain within the ducts all features on the image that are consistent with a dictated pathology report that recites invasive breast cancer with lymphatic and vascular invasion accompanied by an extensive intraductal component. A media viewer for a tissue specimen may be adapted for social networking for example for patient viewing during consultations where the physician wishes to show the patient the results of her biopsy or for reviewing a case with colleagues.

In embodiments patients providers office staff consultants hospitals diagnostic centers treatment facilities and specialized equipment vendors may interact with syndicated time utilization management systems associated with special formatting and or display properties. In response to a patient query for example data may be formatted to provide a pre operative and post operative schedule of appointments pertaining to a surgical procedure that has been arranged. In response to a physician query data may be formatted to set forth the particular patient s schedule as part of the physician s overall calendar that includes on call responsibilities time in the office and time out of the office.

In embodiments patients providers office staff consultants hospitals diagnostic centers treatment facilities and specialized equipment vendors may interact with syndicated time utilization management systems having special identification properties or having restricted or conditional access properties. Controlling access to data within a time utilization management system has particular importance in the medical office management context because of the overarching regulatory requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA which sets forth inter alia Privacy Rules and Security Rules governing interactions between patients and health care providers. As will be understood by those of skill in the art the HIPAA Security Rules while technology neutral require an evaluation of the security measures in place for a particular provider or health care facility an accurate and thorough risk analysis and a series of documented solutions derived from a number of complex factors unique to that institution. In deciding which security measures to use a provider or health care facility both termed covered entities in the HIPAA regulations takes into account its size the costs of appropriate security measures and their operational impact. For example covered entities are expected to balance risks of inappropriate disclosure or use of electronically protected health information EPHI against the impact of various security protective measures so that smaller less sophisticated practices will not have to implement as extensive a security system as larger more complex entities. Security standards under HIPAA are divided into three categories administrative physical and technical safeguards. Technical safeguards in particular are suitable for integration with an enhanced syndication system that includes a formatting service to format content for display in accordance with security parameters. Technical safeguards may include authentication controls to verify that the person requesting access to EPHI is authorized for such access and encryption for data being transmitted or stored. An authentication and encryption service may provide selective access to certain data such as identification on patient health information or such a service may provide password protected access to certain data modules.

In embodiments patients providers office staff consultants hospitals diagnostic centers treatment facilities and specialized equipment vendors may interact with syndicated time utilization management systems associated with database functions that permit the data quality to be verified provide for transformation of data enable searching filtering or clustering of data or categorizing the data into hierarchies interrelationships interrelated groups and the like. For example database functions applied to syndicated time utilization management systems may allow for identification of a practice s most commonly performed procedures by collecting data from physician schedules or for determination of a practice s demographics by collecting data from office visits or de identified patient records. Such information in turn may be used to justify practice resource allocation or marketing strategies. Similarly database functions applied to syndicated time utilization management systems may provide statistics about procedure outcomes including length of hospital stay for a particular diagnosis number of post operative visits resources utilized complications and the like statistics that are useful within the managed care context for negotiating with carriers.

As another example syndicated time utilization management systems associated with database functions may facilitate physician credentialing and monitoring of continuing medical education CME . Formal educational sessions like conferences for example may be entitled to a particular level of CME credit and less formal activities self study journal club and the like may be entitled to a different level of CME credit. Medical license renewal may require a designated number of credit hours at each level. Hospital or operating facility credentialing may require a designated number of credit hours pertaining to particular topics or may require documentation of a particular number of procedures performed. A syndicated time utilization management system may permit the physician to log all CME related activities in a database so that the activities may be sorted by type of CME activity course workshop grand rounds journal review article writing teaching etc. by medical topic infectious diseases primary care general surgery risk management medical economics or by any other desirable parameter. The syndicated time utilization management system may then allow sorted information to be retrieved for example by physicians cataloguing their own experience for credentialing license renewal or malpractice insurance purposes. The system may further allow information to be retrieved for example by interested third parties such as malpractice carriers hospital credentialing committees medical specialty organizations state boards of registration in medicine and the like.

In embodiments patients providers office staff consultants hospitals diagnostic centers treatment facilities and specialized equipment vendors may interact with syndicated time utilization management systems associated with semantic rules that may enable the creation of metadata. Semantic rules may also provide for metadata enrichment interpretation or translation of syndicated time utilization management systems as well as permit the creation of knowledge structures e.g. using OPML and the use of a dictionary thesaurus or the like. Use of metadata for syndicated time utilization management systems may permit the retrieval for example of all physician encounters with a particular disease entity within a certain time frame. In this way the collective practice experience with the disease entity can be collected and reported including patient visits continuing medical education conferences journal club articles and the like. Such information may be useful as an adjunct to risk management for physician self education or as a basis for practice marketing.

In embodiments patients providers office staff consultants hospitals diagnostic centers treatment facilities and specialized equipment vendors may interact with syndicated time utilization management systems to which others may subscribe. For example within a medical practice all physicians may be able to subscribe to an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel that sets forth the office schedule on call schedule and prospective out of office plans for each physician so that this information can guide them in making plans for attending conferences setting up complicated operations that require multi physician coverage or arranging family vacations. As another example all physicians within a practice may be able to subscribe to an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel that displays parameters of physician workload and or performance.

In embodiments the time management systems may be associated with information that may provide for further processing and management of the data. For example the data may list the time management system source the date on which it was last updated etc. Thus the data may provide for further aggregation republication and the like.

In embodiments patients providers office staff consultants hospitals diagnostic centers treatment facilities and specialized equipment vendors may interact with syndicated time utilization management systems within an infrastructure that provides for data security authentication management of the traffic created by the RSS feeds web feeds RSS streams or RSS channels logging and pinging technology and or other communications. Such an infrastructure may permit patient notification when test results are available for example by a pinging system. Similarly a patient who is awaiting an opening in a busy practice schedule may be pinged to alert her to access the time utilization management system and reserve the open slot. If she does not respond in time and the slot becomes filled another message or ping may be sent to alert her that the opening is no longer available. As another example the infrastructure may correlate physician CME activities with various regulatory requirements to track the physician s progress in accumulating CME credits and map it against the timeframe within which such credits should be accumulated. The physician may then receive a message indicating that his CME progress has fallen off track so that he can take steps to acquire the necessary credits.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems via syndicated data obtained through an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel to enable more efficient and effective use of information for all constituents within a medical practice setting. The syndicated information management systems may include medical record data virtual patient management data patient input or output data tracking data and the like. The syndicated information management systems may employ any of the functions and features of the enhanced syndication system described above including security conditional access traffic management logging semantic analysis database services and so forth. In one aspect a syndicated information management system as disclosed herein may provide the functionality of an enterprise content management system using syndicated content and outlines delivered through the enhanced syndication system.

In embodiments the saving storing merging retrieval and publication of syndicated information management information through RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel may be associated with an application consisting of a client side program. The client side program may be formatted to operate on client devices such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a pocket personal computer a cellular phone Blackberry personal digital assistant or other SMS text enabled device or the like. The client side program may be an individual one such as a Palm Pilot scheduler or an enterprise one for the input and management of medical information. As an example a client side program and device may permit input of medical information obtained during off site patient encounters such as examinations performed or treatment plans formulated during hospital rounds. This information may be made available in the office based official medical record and it may be retrieved by practitioners in the medical practice or by other practitioners within the hospital setting for example who subscribe to the medical practice s syndicated information management system.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to interact with the syndicated information management systems may be associated with an aggregator to track updates. In this way medical information may be collected chronologically as patient related data test results reports and the like and management decisions evolve over time. In this way for example changes in a patient s treatment plan may be tracked and updated over time so that a patient a physician or a third party such as an emergency room or a commercial pharmacy may retrieve the patient s current medication schedule.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to interact with syndicated information management systems may be associated with a content management system that may provide summaries of the syndicated data available dates associated with the syndicated data links to access the full non summarized data parameters associated with medical information and the like. In certain embodiments the content management system may include a proprietary program for developing and maintaining electronic medical records. A content management system as applied to prescribing medications for example may include with each prescription the physician package insert a patient friendly summary of the package insert a list of other medications that the patient is taking a database and algorithm for identifying conflicts among prescribed medications a patient customized schedule for when to take medications before meals with food at bedtime etc. and the like. It will be understood by practitioners of ordinary skill that a variety of content management systems may be advantageous for example in caring for patients with complex disorders with multiple medications e.g. HIV diabetes cancers etc. .

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems through the use of a RSS enabled application providing social networking. As an example a consultant may retrieve and share syndicated data with other healthcare providers with whom she shares care for a patient a clinical specialty clinical population type and the like. Clinical factors of relevance to physicians who seek to share medical information may use detailed tags to provide narrowly tailored RSS feeds web feeds RSS streams or RSS channels for ongoing data sharing with colleagues. Such a process may allow physicians who care for a common patient or patient population to share data more efficiently and to improve cross specialty collaboration in patient care. With a syndicated information management system a visit by a particular patient to a consultant and any associated data becomes available to the primary care physician for retrieval via RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel without the delay associated with paper records or specifically delivered electronic communications faxes emails and the like . Such systems may permit virtual case management for a particular patient.

With a syndicated information management system a patient s interactions with providers outside the medical practice may be seamlessly integrated into an overall patient management protocol. An orthopedist s operative notes and office visit records for example may be available to the physical therapist or visiting nurse who is providing post operative care similarly the orthopedist may retrieve via RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel those notes produced by the therapist or visiting nurse pertaining to the post operative care of the patient. Tags attached to the notes may alert the physician to situations where the outside provider observes a deviation from the physician s treatment plan or a deviation from normal progress milestones so that the physician may take appropriate measures.

A syndicated information management system may for example permit a medical practice to establish a comprehensive home monitoring program. The physician may provide a treatment plan with specific elements available to particular providers in the community. Such providers may also retrieve patient data that is relevant to their role in patient care. A physical therapist for example would need different patient information than a dietician or a social worker. Different patient care roles may correspond to different security levels or access routes within the syndicated information management system.

A syndicated information management system may further provide for communications from a patient via email or other electronic submissions. Email correspondence from a patient may be tagged with identifiers that indicate its subject matter level of urgency and the like. The email correspondence may be triaged to the appropriate respondent whether physician nurse office manager physical therapist etc. A syndicated information management system may include other input from the patient such as a logbook of symptoms e.g. angina experienced at 6 AM 10 AM and 3 PM on Dec. 10 2005 a record of data e.g. Dec. 10 2005 weight blood pressure and dietary intake a record of health maintenance activities e.g. Dec. 10 2005 cardiac exercise class 1.0 hours brisk walking 0.5 hours resistance exercises 0.5 hours yoga 1.0 hours and the like allowing providers to review the patient s participation in or compliance with treatment plans.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems through the use of an application providing a media viewer. For example a RSS item may refer to an image source such as an MRI image in the medical record from a hospital and may specify a viewer for the source image that is available through the registry. In operation a client with appropriate permissions may view the image also as managed e.g. through the metadata for the enhanced syndication system may retrieve the appropriate viewer service from the registry and may apply the viewer to view the source image. For example a physical therapist may retrieve a patient s XRays or MRIs before instituting a therapy protocol. As another example a visiting nurse may capture images of a healing wound that the physician can retrieve to track a patient s progress. When images are captured using a stable or calibrated image scale they may be compared over time to determine whether a wound is getting better or worse. A visiting nurse or a patient may also capture digital video images digital audio diagnostic instrument output and the like as real time or archived data. A patient experiencing a worrisome symptom for example may transmit real time data via webcam to a physician who may then use the data as a basis for diagnosis or treatment. Those of ordinary skill in the art are familiar with a variety of instruments for professional or home care digital otoscopes ophthalmoscopes blood pressure monitors etc. that are suitable for these purposes. Such tools for image capture and for digital data capture in the community setting may permit patient monitoring and patient care to be carried out remotely.

A syndicated information management system may further provide for communications to a patient via email or other electronic means. For example a surgeon s office may provide descriptive information or instructions regarding an operation or post operative care for retrieval via RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel. Such information or instructions may involve documents audible instructions graphics still images emails live chat or video clips. For example a patient with questions about how to apply a surgical dressing or how to carry out a particular physical therapy exercise may download a video that illustrates performing the technique. As another alternative the patient may interact with a health care provider e.g. nurse or therapist via live chat or via email to have specific questions answered. Advantageously interactions with the syndicated information management system may be logged recorded and permanently archived for medicolegal purposes or may be incorporated in the patient s medical record.

As another example a syndicated information management system may permit patients to interact with other patients or healthcare providers via RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel to obtain or exchange information about a particular procedure or medical condition. As described herein HIPAA and other regulatory frameworks may require special identification properties or restricted or conditional access properties for information to be exchanged in this way. Interactions with the syndicated medical information management system and the properties restricting this access may be logged recorded and permanently archived for legal purposes or to demonstrate compliance with applicable regulations.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems through the use of an application providing a user interface for viewing information related to a particular health care issue. For example a customized user interface may be available to a patient about to undergo a particular procedure so that she can readily access her medical records and test results can review post operative instructions and discuss them with office personnel via live chat can obtain further procedure specific information from the practice patient education library and can interact with other patients who have consented to participate in procedure related discussions. A client may in response to user input such as clicking on a title of an item in the user interface retrieve the underlying item from the content source as indicated by the arrow .

For example a user interface captioned with the particular procedure My Angioplasty may be designed with icons or other graphic designators that facilitate patient access to relevant information. Within the interface site a patient may click for example on a My Diagnosis icon to view all test results with a query button What does this mean to provide a patient friendly explanation. The interface may offer a search function or a general query function so that a patient may easily find answers to questions about when a particular pre op procedure is scheduled for example or what articles he will need to bring with him to the hospital. A patient may also follow a logical path through angioplasty related information that could be represented graphically on the interface. A clickable image may display a timeline pertaining to the patient s illness for example allowing retrieval of information pertaining to steps in symptom development diagnosis treatment or recovery. A timeline showing all the salient dates so far in a patient s illness may begin for example with Sunday Jan. 1 2006 and include dates through Friday Jan. 20 2006. Clicking on the Sunday Jan. 1 2006 segment of the timeline may display information pertaining to the patient s onset of cardiac symptoms his presentation in the emergency room and the initial diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention performed on that day. Clicking on the Friday Jan. 20 2006 segment of the timeline may display information pertaining to the patient s definitive procedure for example the angioplasty scheduled for that day. As another approach to the same information the patient may click on an icon called My Diagnosis or My Treatment to access a page providing for example chronological listing of diagnostic procedures and their results or a listing of treatment interventions their reasons their outcomes and their follow up. Clickable links on any given page may permit ready navigation throughout the interface

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems through the use of an application providing vertical market integration. Vertical market integration may proceed in a top down or bottom up way. For example as managed care organizations or prescription drug benefits plans alter their formularies this information may be provided top down to physicians caring for the affected patient populations covered lives of a managed care organization or Medicare recipients for example . Physicians then may use formulary information in their prescribing decisions. Along the same lines if physicians in a practice consistently prescribe a drug that is not included in the formulary compiling information about the drug s indications and clinical efficacy may be submitted bottom up to managed care organizations and the like to support including that drug in future formulary listings.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems that support special formatting and or display properties of syndicated content. Formatting and display properties may for example be embedded in metadata associated with a syndicated feed.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems that support use of special identification properties which may be used for example to provide personalization depersonalization access control privacy security HIPAA compliance and so forth.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems that are associated with restricted or conditional access properties. A medical practice may accumulate information about outcomes from a particular procedure on a patient by patient basis for example including length of hospital stay complications and other sequelae. Such information may be available with patient identifiers to physicians within the practice but may not be accessible to other health care institutions except on a de identified basis. The practice may decide not to allow the general population of patients access to such information at all or may only grant patients or prospective patients access to certain aspects of the information for example statistics about length of hospital stay or statistics about incidence of complications.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems associated with database functions that permit the data quality to be verified provide for transformation of data enable searching filtering or clustering of data or categorizing the data into hierarchies interrelationships interrelated groups and the like. For example database functions applied to syndicated information management systems may allow an individual to search for information that a practice has accumulated regarding a particular surgical procedure. Such information may include the practice s pre and post operative protocols the number of procedures each physician has performed within the practice statistics regarding procedure outcomes contact information for other patients who have agreed following proper informed consent to act as resources for others undergoing the procedure patient satisfaction data and the medical and scientific publications and references that the practice has accumulated pertaining to the procedure. Access to such information may be regulated by restricted or conditional access properties limiting such access to certain patient populations for example those who have scheduled the procedure already or to certain categories of healthcare personnel.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems associated with semantic rules that enable for example the creation of metadata. Semantic rules may also provide for metadata enrichment interpretation or translation of syndicated information management systems as well as permit the creation of knowledge structures e.g. using OPML and the use of a dictionary thesaurus or the like. Use of metadata for syndicated information management systems may permit for example the accumulation organization and compilation of procedure related information such as procedure outcome adverse events duration of hospitalization number of post operative visits and other parameters of physician performance and practice resource utilization. Such compilations may provide support for economic decisions within the practice for physician credentialing or for negotiations with malpractice carriers or third party payers.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems to which others may subscribe. For example all patients within a medical practice may be able to subscribe to an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel that regularly retrieves and updates information the practice provides pertaining to a particular diagnosis or procedure and that collects for the patient publicly available information on the same topic. Physicians in a particular practice setting may subscribe to an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel that regularly retrieves and updates information pertaining to particular scientific medical or socioeconomic topics e.g. a neurologist may wish to retrieve scientific information pertaining to stem cells medical information pertaining to treatment of Parkinson s disease including using stem cells in such treatment and socioeconomic information about the ethics of using stem cells and the legislative debate regarding their availability for research and therapy .

In embodiments the information management systems may be further associated with information that may provide for the management of the data. For example the data may list the information management system source the date on which it was last updated etc. Thus the data may provide for further aggregation republication and the like. A surgeon who has performed a series of successful operations for example may publish the series through the syndicated information management system so that other subscribing surgeons in the specialty may learn from her experience. While such publication does not provide the quality control of a peer reviewed medical journal it may offer practitioners more immediate access to developments in an area of specialization.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions may interact with syndicated information management systems within an infrastructure that provides for data security authentication management of the traffic created by the RSS feeds web feeds RSS streams or RSS channels logging and pinging technology and or other communications. Such an infrastructure may for example provide for patient alerts when new information becomes available or when deadlines are nearing. As an example a practice may alert all its Medicare patients when an update on Medicare Part D coverage becomes available either through the practice itself or through a reliable outside source. Further the infrastructure may include reminders or countdowns as deadlines approach. Medicare patients who have not selected a prescription drug program may be reminded periodically as the deadline approaches until they make their selection. Or as another example a patient who needs to avoid eating and drinking NPO for a period before a procedure can be offered a countdown notification during the hours before the NPO restriction begins.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems via syndicated data obtained through an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel to enable more efficient and effective use of business functions for all constituents within a medical practice setting. As used herein an individual or entity having a business relationship with the health care practice such as those individuals and entities listed herein may be considered a business associate of the health care practice. The syndicated business management systems may include managed care coverage schedules third party reimbursement schedules accounting and financial management systems billing and collection systems cost projection systems economic analysis systems and the like. Business management systems may rely upon proprietary or commercially available software and may utilize all types of syndicated data.

In embodiments the saving storing merging retrieval and publication of syndicated information management information through RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel may be associated with an application consisting of a client side program. The client side program may be formatted to operate on client devices such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a pocket personal computer a cellular phone Blackberry personal digital assistant or other SMS text enabled device or the like. The client side program may be an individual one such as a Palm Pilot scheduler or an enterprise one for the input and management of business financial or economic data. The client side program may also be provided by a third party for example a proprietary accounting program that has been prepared for the medical office by an accountant or consultant. As another example medical specialty societies may provide practice management programs that are particularly useful to practitioners in a certain field. Cosmetic surgery dermatology etc. practices with a high volume of cash paying patients may find certain software advantageous while Medicare or Medicaid dominated specialties may find other types of software advantageous.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to interact with the syndicated business management systems may be associated with an aggregator to track updates. In this way business related information may be collected chronologically as reimbursement schedules change over time for example or as components e.g. rent utilities equipment costs insurance charges etc. of a practice s cost structure change. In this way for example a practice s income and expense projections can be updated to take changing assumptions into consideration.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to interact with syndicated business management systems may be associated with a content management system that may provide summaries of the syndicated data available dates associated with the syndicated data links to access the full non summarized data parameters associated with business information and the like. Business management systems may draw from other sources of syndicated data so that they may provide customized information for a query. For example a patient with a new diagnosis of breast cancer may wish to compare the costs time expenditures and medical outcomes associated with two available treatment modalities e.g. mastectomy vs. wide excision with radiation . Business management systems together with time utilization management systems and information management systems may provide the customized answers to the patient queries.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems through the use of a RSS enabled application providing social networking. The business manager may prepare a monthly budget for example in collaboration with the practice accountant. The budget may be integrated with an inventory management system that keeps track of supplies and instruments that are on hand. Other members of the office staff may then view the budget the inventory tracker and an ongoing tabulation of practice expenses to make decisions about purchasing supplies or capital equipment.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems through the use of an RSS enabled application providing a user interface for viewing data records and the like. For example a client may in response to user input such as clicking on a title of an item in the user interface retrieve the underlying item from the content source as indicated by an arrow . For example a user interface may be tailored to the needs of a back office accounts manager to look up the status of insurance claims processing for a set of patients or a user interface may be set up to allow the patient to track the status of coverage approval for an upcoming procedure.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems through the use of an application providing a media viewer.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems associated with special formatting and or display properties. Certain accounting information for example may be converted into graphic representations that the user could retrieve.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems associated with special identification properties. In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems associated with restricted or conditional access properties. Certain members of the office staff such as the business manager may have access to all business management information while other members of the office staff have only limited access. Similarly individual physicians may be able to track the progress of insurance coverage decisions for their own patients but may not be able to view information about other patients in the practice. The practice accountant for example may be able to retrieve all financial and resource utilization data without access to identifiable patient data.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems associated with database functions that permit the data quality to be verified provide for transformation of data enable searching filtering or clustering of data or categorizing the data into hierarchies interrelationships interrelated groups and the like. For example database functions applied to syndicated business management systems may allow a practice manager to compile information about the resources expended in treating a particular condition or about the resource utilization of a particular physician. A certain condition for example diabetes may be more expensive to treat while other conditions such as an acute infectious disease may be less expensive to the practice. Decisions about how to grow the practice may be based in part on data about the costliness or the profitability of a particular practice area. Such information could also guide hiring decisions such as whether to hire a diabetes specialist or an infectious diseases doctor or whether to hire additional nursing personnel for a certain area of the practice. Similarly data about outcome and resource utilization may be collected to determine the efficiency and profitability of a particular physician. Such information could guide decisions about compensation promotion and overall practice development.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems associated with semantic rules that may enable the creation of metadata. Semantic rules may also provide for metadata enrichment interpretation or translation of syndicated information management systems as well as permit the creation of knowledge structures e.g. using OPML and the use of a dictionary thesaurus or the like. Use of metadata for syndicated business management systems may permit for example the accumulation organization and compilation of diagnosis related information such as reimbursement amount for each third party payer length of time before reimbursement practice resources consumed number of patients with the diagnosis within the practice demographic information about the incidence of the diagnosis and other diagnoses associated with the primary diagnosis. Such compilations may allow for economic projections pertaining to the primary diagnosis including income projections expense projections and practice development projections.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems to which others may subscribe. A billing service may for example access the procedure and reimbursement information for a medical practice and send bills such as balance bills to patients as appropriate.

In embodiments the information management systems may be further associated with information that may provide for the management of the data. For example the data may list the information management system source the date on which it was last updated etc. Thus the data may provide for further aggregation republication and the like. An accountant or consultant specializing in medical practices for example may aggregate information from a number of practice clients to identify trends among the client population and to allow the individual practice clients to compare themselves to the larger population of medical practice clients. The accountant or consultant may further compare the group of practice clients with larger trends in the profession and share these comparisons with the individual clients.

In embodiments patients physicians and or support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institutions and third parties such as payers billing services medical specialty organizations service providers and the like may interact with syndicated business management systems within an infrastructure that provides for data security authentication management of the traffic created by the RSS feeds web feeds RSS streams or RSS channels logging and pinging technology and or other communications. For example a business management system may permit automated inventory control with an automatic restocking order to be generated when a certain number of medical supplies have been used and with tracking of supply usage. Excess supply utilization may produce an alert for the office manager so that he can investigate the utilization further. An appropriately credentialed vendor may also monitor usage patterns in the office to facilitate just in time provisioning or to offer volume related discounts.

While the illustrative embodiments herein have described syndicated time utilization information and management systems as applied to medical practices and related support personnel and institutions it will be understood by those of ordinary skill that syndicated time utilization information and management systems as well as other disclosure included herein may also be applied to other health care practices including but not limited to dental practices psychotherapeutic practices cosmeceutical practices chiropractic practices osteopathic practices physical therapy and rehabilitation practices podiatrist practices and the like. In addition those of ordinary skill will further appreciate that syndicated time utilization information and management systems may be applied to alternative allopathic or nontraditional health care services.

As medical scientific and other academic research becomes more complex it is desirable to have many investigators across diverse geographic settings participate in a project. It is also desirable that all participants have access to a complex mix of data sources that may include scientific background information experimental data clinical data about disease states or targets laboratory notes regulatory requirements and the like. Researchers may collaborate to produce a publication or other report concerning a study and its results. Researchers working together on a project may also interact with third parties collectively termed reviewers who review evaluate and or comment upon the research its data or its conclusions. Seamless communication among collaborating researchers advances scientific progress by making it more efficient. Transparent interaction between the research team and reviewers expedites publication of research results and facilitates decision making about grants and regulatory approval.

It is desirable therefore to provide researchers with access to the internal research data the external scientific literature and the real time discoveries of their collaborators. It is further desirable to allow researchers to collaborate on authoring reports of their research for publication or for submission to reviewing agencies. It is also desirable to permit researchers to interact with interested third parties. Interested third parties may be reviewers whose interaction with researchers may include feedback or other comments pertaining to the experimental or reporting aspects of the scientific research. Interested third parties may also include other stakeholders such as patients sponsors or advocacy groups whose interaction with researchers may keep the stakeholders informed about relevant scientific investigations and may keep the researchers informed about community and industry needs.

In certain embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems in a syndicated format via syndicated data obtained through an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel to enable more efficient and effective communication about research endeavors. The syndicated collaboration management systems may include systems for reporting experimental methods and materials systems for documenting experimental results systems for analyzing experimental data systems for designing clinical trials and the like.

In embodiments the saving storing merging retrieval and publication of collaboration management system information through RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel may be associated with an application consisting of a client side program. The client side program may be formatted to operate on client devices such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a pocket personal computer a cellular phone Blackberry personal digital assistant or other SMS text enabled device or the like. The client side program may be an individual one such as a Palm Pilot scheduler or an enterprise one and may use proprietary software or commercially available software such as Microsoft Outlook. As an example a researcher at one location may retrieve the experimental data of a collaborating colleague on her Palm Pilot or Blackberry with real time updating.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to interact with the syndicated collaboration management systems may be associated with an aggregator to track updates. A researcher who is part of a multisite research endeavor for example can keep track of the results being obtained by collaborating colleagues at other sites.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to interact with collaboration management systems may be associated with a content management system that may provide summaries of the syndicated data available statistical analysis of the syndicated data parameters associated with the data collection or a graphical representation of the syndicated data for example on an experiment by experiment basis on a site by site basis or on an aggregate basis. The content management system may further provide links that direct the user from a data summary to the full non summarized data. The full non summarized data available from the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel may include for example information about the experiments conducted and the raw data obtained.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems through the use of a RSS enabled application providing social networking. As an example a medicinal chemist involved in drug discovery may wish to review the preclinical research being carried out in his company that pertains to a certain drug or class of drugs. By monitoring the bench or animal research conducted on a particular drug or class of drugs the chemist may gain insights that would guide his selection of other drug candidates. Collaboration management systems by facilitating communication among researchers in diverse geographic locations may inherently involve social networking. Social networking may involve for example sharing of a patient or subject population sharing of a clinical specialty or sharing of a research interest optionally from different perspectives. As an example the public health services of a host country may wish to monitor the findings of a research team conducting studying a particular disease or condition that seriously affects that country s population. Availability of a social networking application may for example make a clinical trial protocol particularly attractive to a host country where the results could translate directly into improved health for the local citizenry. Social networking may involve for example collaboration among researchers patients subjects sponsors reviewers overseers monitors or regulators.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems through the use of a RSS enabled application providing a user interface for viewing data records and the like. For example a client may keep track of the progress of various research projects by clicking an icon in the user interface to retrieve the underlying item from the content source as indicated by an arrow . The underlying item may include clinical or laboratory data obtained by a group of researchers data pertaining to subjects enrolled in a clinical trial data about the management of the clinical trial or scientific and or business information obtained from academic journals web postings and the like. For example a clinical trial subject may be tracked through the clinical trial so that individual experimental results about that subject may be seen. Administrative information pertaining to an individual subject may also be tracked so that the trial organizer can be sure that the appropriate steps have been taken for enrolling and pre evaluating each trial subject. As an example a client researcher who clicks on an icon representing a clinical protocol may be able to determine how many patients have been enrolled at which sites whether the appropriate informed consent has been obtained whether patient follow up is proceeding on track whether certain patients need more individualized follow up and the like.

Similarly a client subject who clicks on an icon representing the protocol in which she is participating may access information governing her participation including tests or other requirements that she must fulfill materials generated by the researchers pertaining to the trial or to the condition being studied communications with other participants and the like. The information associated with the icon may be sourced as a syndicated data stream that may be periodically updated to provide current information.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems through the use of a RSS enabled application providing a media viewer. For example a client who clicks on an icon representing his company s preclinical research on a drug may be able to view images corresponding to pathology results for a set of experimental animals who received the drug. Other images may be viewed in like manner including photographs MRI images CT scans XRay images ultrasound echocardiogram angiography and the like with images captured as still images or as video images. In certain embodiments the media viewer may include an image management program permitting for example three dimensional reconstruction of images or other image manipulation. For example 3 dimensional reconstruction of images may be performed on CT scans from an experimental animal treated with experimental placement of bone fixation plates allowing researchers to determine how the animal s bone structure responds to the plates. As another example a pathologist evaluating the histological slides from a series of experimental animals may be able to compare them with each other using an algorithm based image comparator program. In similar manner a group of pathologists located at different research centers may be able to access and compare images of the histology of all specimens collected during the research program. The media viewer for the microscopic images of the specimen may include links to tissue sample reference images so that the physician may compare the specimen image with the image of a normal specimen. An additional program may be available within the media viewer to compare features of the sample with normal histological features to highlight pathological diagnoses.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems through the use of an RSS enabled application providing vertical market integration. For example clinicians using a product in a clinical trial or after its approval may be kept informed of developments during laboratory research on that same product. Long term animal studies performed in the lab on a product like Vioxx for example may inform clinicians who are involved in clinical trials so that they may pay particular attention to findings that may not have previously appeared relevant.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems associated with special formatting and or display properties. In response to a researcher s query from one clinical trial site for example data for her own patients may be personalized while data for other clinical trial patients may be anonymized. As another example researchers in blinded or double blinded studies may not be able to view patient information that discloses the treatment regimen each patient is receiving.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems having special identification properties or having restricted or conditional access properties. Such properties may allow for patient data to be blinded for example or may allow for patient data to be depersonalized. Researchers who also provide clinical care to a patient population may have access to individual patient identifiers for example while other researchers may be restricted from accessing this information. Or experimental results may be viewed anonymously by trial sponsors who click on the subject identification number.

As a further example in certain embodiments all meaningful patient identifiers may be held in a syndicated pod independent of other clinical data where a researcher would need an access key consistent with a particular access level. In this way information that has been blinded to researcher and patient alike may be sequestered in a syndicated pod only to be accessed under certain conditions. The randomization results that contain information about who received the study drug and who received the placebo may be held in a syndicated pod for example accessible only to certain monitors if a predetermined pattern of adverse events or of overwhelming drug success becomes evident. The designated monitors who can access the data pod and crack the code may be determined in advance and provided with appropriate credentials. Similarly the circumstances under which the randomization code should be broken may be determined in advance and incorporated into the conditions allowing access to the sequestered data pod.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems associated with database functions that permit the data quality to be verified provide for transformation of data enable searching filtering or clustering of data or categorizing the data into hierarchies interrelationships interrelated groups and the like. For example database functions applied to collaboration management systems may allow for the identification of adverse event patterns from a collection of trial sites or for review of the demographics of clinical trial enrollees. Database functions applied to data collected by a group of researchers may facilitate ordering the data for subsequent statistical analysis. In one example syndicated data banking may permit non centralized storing of multi site data. Database functions applied to the banked data may prepare the experimental results for subsequent analysis and publication.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems associated with semantic rules that may enable the creation of metadata. Semantic rules may also provide for metadata enrichment interpretation or translation of syndicated collaboration management systems as well as permit the creation of knowledge structures e.g. using OPML and the use of a dictionary thesaurus or the like. Use of metadata for syndicated collaboration management systems may permit for example the retrieval of all test results of a certain type for patients within a clinical trial. All kidney function tests performed on subjects in a clinical trial for example could be retrieved in accordance with semantic rules that permit the identification of tests of all types that relate to renal function such as blood tests including blood urea nitrogen serum creatinine serum potassium and the like urine tests including urinalysis and urine sediment analysis and creatinine clearance studies kidney ultrasounds and radiological studies like intravenous pyelogram . Retrieving a variety of data that pertain to a particular organ may allow the early identification of patterns indicating the organ to be damaged by the study drug. As another example metadata applied to study results may indicate when abnormal results have been obtained i.e. a test result that is outside the parameters of what is considered normal. A surveillance monitor may then retrieve via RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel an update on abnormal results from all test sites as a clinical trial progresses allowing her to identify problematic trends.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems to which others may subscribe and researchers may publish their results within the collaboration management systems. For example a sponsor of a clinical trial may be able to subscribe to an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel that sets forth the progress of the trial from multiple sites including enrollment statistics images of signed informed consent documents and data from individual anonymized subjects. As another example clinicians at trial sites may be able to subscribe to an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel that provides updated data from bench studies or animal studies that are relevant to the product being tested clinically. As a further example an individual researcher may subscribe to a RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel that sets forth data obtained by other researchers at different locations. Such subscription may make collaboration possible among individuals under the same institutional umbrella. With proper access restrictions limiting users and limiting access to data sets such subscription may also permit collaboration among individuals from different institutions or from different corporations.

In embodiments the collaboration management systems may be associated with information that may provide for further processing and management of the data. For example the data from a clinical trial may further provide information about the site from which it was obtained the demographics of the anonymized patient the date when the test was performed etc. Thus the data may provide for further aggregation republication and the like.

In embodiments researchers may interact with collaboration management systems within an infrastructure that provides for data security authentication management of the traffic created by the RSS feeds web feeds RSS streams or RSS channels logging and pinging technology and or other communications. Such an infrastructure may protect vital proprietary data during multisite clinical trials or within a large organization. Such an infrastructure may also protect patient confidentiality during clinical trials. Moreover such an infrastructure may permit notifications to be delivered to appropriate individuals for example notification of sponsors when an adverse event occurs or notification of other researchers.

In embodiments researchers research assistants research analysts report drafters sponsors and data collectors collectively termed authors may interact with syndicated authorship management systems via syndicated authorship information obtained through an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel to collaboration in the collection exchange and reporting of data or other information obtained during research. The syndicated authorship information may involve research related information and all varieties of experimental and observational data such as basic scientific data social scientific data epidemiological or statistical data preclinical data clinical data and the like alone or in combination with narratives including discussions descriptions analyses or other reports pertaining to the information and or data. Relevant authorship systems may include systems for reporting experimental methods and materials systems for preparing manuscripts systems for preparing presentations systems for preparing regulatory submissions and systems for preparing proposals.

In embodiments researchers research assistants research analysts report drafters sponsors and data collectors may interact with syndicated authorship management systems through the use of a RSS enabled application providing social networking. As an example an epidemiological researcher may collect data from a number of geographically dispersed investigators and provide them comments on the design of their data collection methods. Through this interplay the collection methods may be improved so that the research results are more meaningful. As another example collaborators on a report for publication may each work on a particular segment of the report and elicit comments from the other collaborators in real time. Versions and revisions may be available to the entire collaboration team as each author works on his or her segment.

In embodiments researchers research assistants research analysts report drafters sponsors and data collectors may interact with syndicated authorship management systems through the use of an application providing a media viewer.

Semantic rules may also provide for metadata enrichment interpretation or translation of syndicated authorship management systems as well as permit the creation of knowledge structures e.g. using OPML and the use of a dictionary thesaurus or the like. Use of metadata for syndicated authorship management systems may permit the ready identification of data trends by a collaborating group of authors.

In embodiments researchers research assistants research analysts report drafters sponsors and data collectors may interact with syndicated authorship management systems to which others may subscribe. For example registrants for a conference may be able to subscribe to an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel that regularly retrieves and updates accepted submissions to the conference including slides video audio and data to be included in conference presentations. As another example a collaborating group of authors may circulate their preliminary report to a network of peers coincident with or in advance of formal submission for publication.

In embodiments the authorship management systems may be further associated with information that may provide for the management of the data. For example the information may list the source of the data in a work of authorship the date on which it was last updated etc. Thus the data may provide for further aggregation republication and the like. A group of researchers for example who has identified noteworthy trends in their investigations may publish the series through the syndicated authorship management system so that other subscribing scientists in the field may learn from their experience. While such publication does not provide the quality control of a peer reviewed scientific journal it may offer more immediate access to the earliest research findings.

An important component of improving health care quality is translating research evidence to standard medical practice and integrating other useful information into clinical care to assist decision making. Many well documented effective therapies remain underutilized in spite of clinical trial results published in respected medical journals and extensive media attention. For example despite the documented clinical efficacy of ACE inhibitors within multiple disease classes the drugs remain under prescribed in the clinical populations for which they are indicated. Documented evidence of an effective therapy does not immediately lead to its adoption into clinical practice. Adoption of effective therapies may be slowed by physician institution and patient based barriers.

One of the many challenges of a physician s practice concerns medical decision making. At its most basic medical decision making refers to making the decision about which medical treatment is most appropriate or inappropriate for a patient at a point in time given the current medical evidence and the patient s unique demographic and clinical circumstances. The difficulties of medical decision making stem in part from the multitude of patient factors influencing treatment choice the continually evolving nature of medical treatments their understanding and therapeutic advances and the time stresses of physicians that make it increasingly difficult for them to analyze new medical studies and integrate new medical findings into their patient practices. For example in the course of a standard twenty minute check up with a patient a cardiologist must evaluate a patient s vital signs inquire about how the patient has been feeling inquire about other health ailments e.g. disease comorbidities ensure that new medications don t need to be prescribed that current medication dosages don t need to be altered that other physicians have not prescribed medications that may have negative interactions with the patient s heart medications have a working knowledge of recent developments in medical research that may have a bearing on a patient with the demographic and clinical profile of the current patient and so on. The information load is substantial. Often physicians must knowingly or unknowingly take informational shortcuts in the course of care. For example a cardiologist may be confident that Medication A is indicated for the patient but may not recall a study from the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating that the effects of Medication A are significantly improved when it is taken in conjunction with Medication B. The patient is conscientiously prescribed only Medication A by the cardiologist and as a result of not receiving Medication B as well achieves sub optimal healthcare outcomes due to the physician s informational limitation. Compounding the problem is that the physician may not have an opportunity to realize the error and thus will replicate it with other patients.

Physicians and their support institutions such as hospitals and academic centers have tried to narrow the information gap in a number of ways. Many institutions are moving to the electronic medical chart and similar electronic medical storage systems. The electronic medical chart is designed to move an institution from a paper based records management system to a digital model in which records are more easily searched stored merged and retrieved. If a physician can key a query for an informational element she seeks and pull it up on a screen then she doesn t have to sort through stacks of paper records looking for a patient s current list of medications or the hundreds of other data elements she may need.

In spite of the improvement of the electronic medical record over the paper based system it still has many limitations. For one it is generally a relational database type product that is an isolated storage unit most often within a single health care system. Thus the electronic medical record does not retrieve information from outside a given institution. If a patient is on vacation becomes ill and is forced to visit a hospital away from home the hospital he visits with an electronic data retrieval ability will very likely not have access to the patient s medical record at the institution s in the patient s hometown. Likewise other data sources must be referenced for other of a physician s information needs. Medication lists may be stored in an institution s formulary database. New research findings may have to be accessed via the Internet and a database such as Medline and so forth. In sum the sources of medical data are often grouped according to the internal consistencies and similarities of the data alone rather than grouped by the unique needs of physicians and institutions in order to make optimal medical decisions that promote beneficial health outcomes. The syndication technologies described in detail herein provide methods and systems for interacting with healthcare information on the basis of the needs of physicians and institutions to make informed medical decisions.

As with physicians and institutions patients need information to make medical decisions and many currently lack the resources for making educated decisions regarding treatment options trade offs between medications and the like. A well informed patient is able to participate in the decisions affecting his medical well being and participate in shared decision making with his physician rather than simply passively entrusting his care entirely to a doctor s judgment. Shared decision making inserts patients preferences and values into the decision making process and is preferred by patients. Shared decision making may enhance a patient s understanding of his medical condition provide him with realistic expectations of healthcare outcomes following treatment and improve patient satisfaction. Patient compliance with therapy may also improve when a patient and physician participate in a process of shared decision making.

Some of the circumstances in which shared decision making is most important include i when trade offs exist between near term and long term outcomes ii when there is a small risk of an extremely negative outcome iii when treatment options appear to have minimal differences iv when there are dramatic differences in the kinds of outcomes offered by treatment options v when there are major differences in the probabilities of complications vi when a patient is risk averse vii when a patient is risk insensitive and viii when a patient places extreme value on certain outcomes.

Physicians often present patients information in qualitative terms e.g. There is a very good chance that with a lumpectomy the cancer will not return and you will return to a healthy life. despite evidence that patients are better able to more accurately remember facts presented in numeric probabilistic terms e.g. A woman of your age can expect an X chance that cancer will return within 10 years and an X 10 year survival rate following surgery. . Thus the use of information to assist patient decision making should at minimum include numeric outcome estimates. Estimates may inform patients of procedural risks possible side effects probable outcomes and potential trade offs between treatment options. One likely reason that physicians don t always present such information to patients is that to remember such a vast quantity of numeric information as it applies to the many patients that a physician cares for each with their own unique clinical circumstances is not mentally possible. To stop in the middle of a time limited office visit to do the necessary research online to compute such numeric estimates may be equally unrealistic.

Apart from the direct health benefits that may result from informed patients participating in shared decision making with their physicians better informed patients are also able to make medical decisions that are more congruent with the outcome s they most desire. This level of congruence is likely to improve patients satisfaction with their healthcare that in turn has many economic and regulatory benefits for physicians healthcare institutions and insurers. For example some surgical procedures may improve patients survival but at a cost of the patient enduring a painful intervention and lengthy difficult recovery period. A patient presented with this information may be able to choose the option that is most in line with her wishes and better accept the clinical consequences that flow from this decision.

The syndication technologies described in detail herein provide methods and systems for interacting with healthcare information on the basis of the needs of patients to make informed medical decisions.

Healthcare data that may improve the quality of medical decision making come from many sources including patients medical records records of physician performance standards of care that are published by regulatory and other groups billing information epidemiologic information on the complications events side effects and the like that are associated with medical procedures devices medications and the like. In spite of the usefulness of this information for improving medical decision making it often exists in formats that are not conducive to easy retrieval by interested parties in the course of patient care. For example the American Heart Association may publish guidelines for optimal treatment of hypertension in paper and electronic format. However it would be unwieldy for a physician to carry paper copies of all relevant guidelines and standards pertaining to her patient population and the electronic versions are likely to be website postings as opposed to more readily searchable electronic formats. With syndicated data a physician institution patient or other interested party may create unique sets i.e. feeds of metadata comprised of data elements from multiple sources that are associated principally by a user defined element e.g. a patient s name a disease state a clinical specialty . This specificity of data retrieval coupled with the non centralized storage retrieval processes of syndicated data may make it well suited for providing informational support for medical decision making.

In embodiments a physician s or other health care provider s RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel may be configured by the physician institution for whom the physician is employed a third party enterprise managing physician s accounts or the like. This configuration may be based at least in part on the physician s clinical area of specialization e.g. cardiology endocrinologist general practitioner the institution within which the physician practices e.g. solo practice physician group practice hospital academic center the clinical mix of the physician s patients e.g. elderly cardiology patients with atherosclerosis minors with autism the ICD 10 codes of the patients currently under the physician s care e.g. 1.8.6 H40 H42 Glaucoma patients diagnostic related groups DRG s the geographic location of the physician s practice e.g. US zipcode Southern rural America Mexico the medication prescribing history of the physician e.g. Beta blocker Prozac Zocor the interventions performed by the physician e.g. angioplasty colonoscopy organizations to which the physician holds a current membership e.g. the American Medical Association medical journals to which the physician subscribes e.g. The Lancet medical boards from which the physician has certification continuing medical education events that physician has attended and so forth.

In embodiments a physician and or her support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institution may save store merge retrieve and publish the records of a physician s patients in a syndicated format to enable interested persons to retrieve the clinical patient data through an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel. The records may include patients demographic information such as age sex race religion area code home address work address billing address family information e.g. mother s maiden name emergency contacts birthplace driver s license number employer position and the like. The records may include patients historical clinical information such as medication histories and dosages allergies family medical history past interventions received major illnesses congenital abnormalities previous healthcare providers and their contact information past insurance information and the like. The records may include patients current clinical information such as disease status comorbidities vital signs relevant clinical test summaries allergies current medications and associated dosages functional status other healthcare providers caring for a patient and the associated contact information and the like.

In embodiments the saving storing merging retrieval and publication of patients data through an RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel may be associated with an application consisting of a client side program. The client side program may be formatted to operate on client devices such as a desktop computer laptop computer pocket personal computer a cellular phone Blackberry personal digital assistant or other SMS text enabled device or the like.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to save store merge retrieve and publish patients records may be associated with an aggregator to track updates.

In embodiments the RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel used to save store merge retrieve and publish patients records may be associated with a content management system that may provide summaries of the syndicated data available dates associated with the syndicated data links to access the full non summarized data and the like.

In embodiments a physician and or her support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institution may save store merge retrieve and publish syndicated patient data through the use of an application providing social networking. For example through social networking a physician may be able to communicate and share syndicated data with other healthcare providers with whom the physician shares care for a patient a clinical specialty clinical population type and the like. The clinical factors of relevance to physicians who seek to share clinical data may be published with detailed tags to provide narrowly tailored or easily filtered RSS feeds web feeds RSS streams or RSS channels for ongoing data sharing with colleagues. Such a process may allow physicians who care for a common patient to more efficiently share the patient s data and improve cross specialty collaboration in patient care. For example a cardiologist may be unaware of very recent visits that one of her patients has made to other healthcare providers. With a syndicated data store associated with this patient a visit by the patient the prior day to his endocrinologist and any associated data entering his medical record could be made available to the cardiologist for retrieval via RSS feed web feed RSS stream or RSS channel without the delay associated with paper records or current relational type database. Such a process may provide for physicians to conduct virtual case studies with colleagues around the world and learn clinical details treatment strategies and the like in a more efficient and less costly manner than the traditional face to face physician case study meetings.

In embodiments a physician and or her support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institution may interact with syndicated patient data through the use of an application providing a user interface for viewing data records and the like. For example a client may in response to user input such as clicking on a title of an item in the user interface retrieve the underlying item from the content source as indicated by an arrow .

In embodiments a physician and or her support staff personnel or supporting healthcare institution may interact with syndicated patient data through the use of an application providing a media viewer. For example an RSS item may refer to an image source such as an MRI image in a medical record from a hospital and may specify a viewer for the source image that is available through the registry.

Practitioners of ordinary skill in the art will readily discern that the systems and methods of the present invention are useful in therapeutic diagnostic and administrative settings in a health care facility. With more specificity these systems and methods may be useful for managing a diagnostic system a therapeutic system an administrative system or some combination thereof in a health care facility. As used herein the term health care facility includes hospitals clinics outpatient centers community health centers nursing homes hospices and home care settings school health facilities doctors offices mobile health facilities morgues mobile emergency or disaster response units ambulances labs pharmacies or any place location facility where health or medical care and or information relating to health or medical care is offered and or provided. The term patient as used herein does not require that an abnormal state exists in that individual and the term includes individuals of all ages and further includes the unborn.

Diagnostic systems in a health care facility may be directed to identifying the presence or absence of diseases or medical conditions evaluating the severity of abnormalities or diseases or predicting their prognosis. For example an electrocardiogram whether normal or abnormal may be part of a diagnostic system generally useful in internal medicine cardiology and the like. Moreover diagnostic systems may be useful in monitoring the response of a patient to a therapeutic intervention or in predicting the response of a patient to a therapeutic intervention. Blood glucose tests performed for example with a home blood glucose meter may be part of a diagnostic system generally useful in diabetes care as the patient s insulin doses are varied or as the patient s lifestyle changes. As another example measurement of estrogen receptors on a breast cancer specimen may be part of a diagnostic system generally useful in oncology as an assessment of tumor susceptibility to tamoxifen. Diagnostic systems may specify a normal or abnormal profile in a patient who has not yet exhibited any signs or symptoms of disease. Identifying the presence of a Huntington s chorea gene in a neurologically normal patient may be part of a diagnostic system generally useful in predicting an extremely high likelihood of developing this devastating neurological disorder. Similarly identifying the presence of abnormally high cholesterol in an otherwise asymptomatic patient may be part of a diagnostic system generally useful in predicting the likelihood of subsequent cardiovascular disease. Data pertaining to used by collected by or generated by a diagnostic system may be termed diagnostic data.

In more detail diagnostic systems may include a variety of diagnostic devices. Diagnostic devices may be used in a number of settings within a health care facility including a laboratory setting a diagnostic imaging setting and a clinical setting. Diagnostic devices in a laboratory setting may include devices used in measuring clinical chemistry or toxicology profiles in examining blood or tissue specimens hematology pathology blood banking tissue typing etc. in identifying infectious agents microbiology virology etc in evaluating immunological profiles in profiling gene patterns or protein patterns and the like. Diagnostic devices in a diagnostic imaging setting may include those devices that permit direct visualization of body parts or structures and capture of images therefrom microscopes endoscopes etc. those devices that utilize sound waves Xrays magnetic resonance or other forms or electromagnetic radiation and those devices that further involve administering a contrast medium or an imaging agent angiography barium contrast studies nuclear medicine studies etc. and the like. Diagnostic devices in a clinical setting may include devices useful for anesthesiology and critical care cardiovascular medicine dental practice otorhinolaryngology ear nose throat gastroenterology urology general hospital and personal use general and plastic surgery obstetrics and gynecology ophthalmology physical medicine and other clinical fields. Illustrative examples of diagnostic devices are set forth herein. It is understood that a diagnostic device may also be a combination devices where one component satisfies a diagnostic function. A pulmonary function device for example may provide a measurement of pulmonary function parameters a diagnostic function and may also administer an inhaler treatment a therapeutic function optionally followed by a second measurement of pulmonary function parameters. Combination devices may also include those diagnostic devices that combine a plurality of diagnostic functions.

Therapeutic systems in a health care facility may be directed to altering or improving the course of a disease or of a physiological or pathological process. Interventions carried out to alter or improve the course of a disease or of a physiological or pathological process may be also termed treatments or therapies. The therapeutic intervention supplied by a therapeutic system need not be successful for the system to be considered therapeutic and the intervention need not yield an overall health benefit. A therapeutic intervention may include a conventional medical intervention or a nontraditional intervention including chiropracty naturopathy herbalism acupuncture and the like. Therapeutic systems may be invasive or noninvasive. Examples of invasive systems are those that entail a penetration of or an entry into a body part. Injecting a substance into a patient inserting an endoscope into a patient removing a mole or an organ from a person or setting a patient s fracture are all invasive. By contrast noninvasive interventions generally do not involve penetrating the body or entering a natural or unnatural bodily orifice. Massage ultrasonic physical therapy and dental hygiene for example are noninvasive. Data pertaining to used by collected by or generated by a therapeutic system may be termed therapeutic data.

The systems and methods disclosed herein include systems and methods for managing medical information. The systems and methods may involve storing medical information in a syndication format retrieving the medical information through a syndication collection facility parsing the information into personal and non personal information storing the personal information in a personal information data pool and storing the non personal information in a non personal information pool .

The systems and methods disclosed herein include systems and methods for storing medical information in a syndicated format. The systems and methods may involve storing the medical information in an RSS format an OPML format or other appropriate syndication format. In embodiments the medical information is stored in two data pools . Personal information relating to the medical information may be stored in one of the two data pools . Non personal information relating to the medical information is stored in the other of the two data pools .

The systems and methods disclosed herein include systems and methods for storing medical information in a syndicated format. In embodiments the medical information comprises at least two parts. The at least two parts may be categorized as personal information and non personal information. The personal information relating to the medical information may be stored in one data pool . The non personal information relating to the medical information may be stored in another data pool . The information residing in the two pools may have been related at one point in time but were later separated and stored in separate pools for various reasons. In embodiments the information residing in either pool or both pools may contain references associations pointers tags links directors and the like to the information contained in the other pool . In embodiments the information residing in the pool with personal information is the only information of the two pools of information containing references associations pointers tags links directors and the like to the information in the non personal pool of data. In embodiments the information residing in the pool with non personal information is the only information of the two pools containing references associations pointers tags links directors and the like to the information in the personal pool of data.

The systems and methods disclosed herein include systems and methods for managing medical information. The methods and systems may involve storing medical information in a syndication format wherein the medical information has two parts. In embodiments the two parts are personal and non personal information. Records that require access to the personal information pool such as a composite medical record for a patient may be constructed from an OPML file or similar file that includes embedded access rights to specific data within the personal information pool. Thus an OPML file or the like may be provided that personalizes certain medical data and identifies any data within the available pools that relates to e.g. a specific patient. The OPML file may be controlled by the patient using any suitable computer security and or physical security techniques and the owner may grant transient access as need to medical care givers. Thus there is in one aspect disclosed herein a relational medical record that defines a patient medical history by external reference to a plurality of data pools including at least one secure pool and at least one insecure pool. In such a system an array of data that would otherwise be confined to private medical records may be shared with the health care community for use in research evaluation and so forth.

Embodiments of the present invention are related to the management of pools and streams of information through syndication. The information may relate to medical healthcare business personal or other information syndicated for collection and or analysis. In embodiments a secure pool of data may be formed and the secure pool of data may have been produced through the collection of syndicated information. In embodiments a pool of data with reduced security relating to the secure pool of data may be generated. In embodiments the information residing in the secure pool and the information residing in the unsecured pool or reduced security pool may be recombined through an association. The association may be latent e.g. residing in metadata or explicit e.g. residing in an explicitly expressed relationship spanning e.g. one or more OPML files . In embodiments the data in the secure pool may be have references associations pointers tags links directors and the like to make the association with the data in the reduced security pool to make the reconstruction. In embodiments the data in the reduced security pool may not have references associations pointers tags links directors and the like to make the recombination with the secure data. Removing or not permitting an association may be implemented as an additional security measure.

As generally described herein health care data may be depersonalized and published for general use using a syndication platform or other data publication system. Personalization data may be maintained in a separate secure facility and or tracked through relationships defined using for example an outline grammar such as OPML. In an embodiment personal data e.g. name social security number birth date and or any other data that may be used to identify an individual may be maintained in a conditional access system that provides various degrees and types of access for different users such as government authorities medical professionals individuals identified by the personal data law enforcement authorities and so forth. Thus various degrees of access to personalized and or anonymous data may be supported and controlled. In addition group data may be derived through a personalization engine that provides limited access to personal data for purposes of identifying data for individuals within a demographic or other category. While a health care information system applying these principals is one possible embodiment and is described in greater detail herein it will be appreciated that the principles of this disclosure may be used with a wide range of data sets and potential applications such as a financial data financial services data consumer data customer list data and so forth.

Aspects of the present invention relate to storing healthcare information in separate pools of data wherein the separate pools store information relating to personal and non personal information. In embodiments the personal and non personal information is stored with an association between them e.g. directly or through a relation in a relational database . In embodiments there is no relation between the personal and non personal information. In embodiments the personal and non personal information may have been related at one point in time and then later separated into unrelated information or related in such a way that either the personal or non personal information may be accessed separately or in a combined fashion. In embodiments there is an association between the information in the related pools . In embodiments there is an association that is only made by using information residing in one of the pools . The relationships or lack thereof may be managed independently from the data using for example an outlining grammar such as OPML.

The information produced by the several medical information sources E may be accessible through the Internet E or other network. A syndication collection facility such as a spider or syndicated content search engine may operate in association with a computer facility E. The syndication collection facility E may be directed to collect all information relating to a particular subject e.g. a patient and patient medical records trend information disease information within a geographic region etc. . Syndication collection facilities are described in more detail herein as well as in the reference material incorporated by reference herein. The information collected through the syndication collection facility E may be processed through an algorithm facility E. The algorithm facility E may be adapted to run any type of algorithm designed to manipulate and or interact with data collected by the syndication collection facility E. The algorithm facility may also be adapted to produce reports E and the like and the reports E may be displayed on the computer facility E. The computer facility may be any computer processing equipment such as a desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer palmtop computer wireless computer wired computer PDA mobile communication facility cell phone phone or other system adapted to perform such processes.

Reports E may pertain to an individual a population region disease health risk virus or other entity or health or medical information. A syndication collection facility E may be adapted to collect all of the information pertaining to a particular health related concern for example. For example the concern may relate to encephalitis within the coastal communities of Massachusetts and the syndication collection facility may be adapted to collect any and all information relating to encephalitis within that geographic area or outside that geographic area collected from healthcare information systems E. Three patients in the area may have been recently physically examined and blood work may have been completed. The exams and blood results may indicate they have contracted the disease. The collection facility E may collect this information and the algorithm facility E may manipulate the information along with other related information e.g. climate conditions in the area weather expected in the area mosquito activities mosquito extermination activities etc. to produce reports E predictions estimates historical trends and the like. Examples of reports produced through the collection of syndicated health and or medical information are regional epidemiological reports EA and EB medical trends EC medical device trends ED medical instrument trends EE patient reports EF and the like.

An aspect of the present invention relates to the syndication of medical information and the collection of the syndicated information for the generation of reports and the like. Another aspect of the present invention relates to producing information in a way that protects the privacy of individuals while providing broad access to information that may be used to identify trends histories predictions as well as for other uses. Referring to a medical information platform using pooled information E is illustrated. The medical information platform using pooled information may be described as a system designed to produce pooled information wherein a plurality of pools may be produced one pool containing personal information E e.g. patient name social security number insurance information and one pool containing non personal information E e.g. medical information such as examination results disassociated with a patient s personal information .

The medical information systems E may produce syndicated medical information that is stored in an associated database E. The producing facility E and its associated database E may also be associated with a server E to aid in the collection of the syndicated information they produce. The server E may be associated with the internet or other network E. A syndication collection facility may be adapted with a spider E for example for collecting the syndicated information from the plurality of databases E. An aggregation facility E may also be in use to aggregate the information collected by the spider E and the aggregated information may be parsed through a parsing facility E. The processes used in the collection and manipulation of the syndicated medical information may be operating in association with syndication collection security facility E to ensure privacy and transactional security.

The information that is parsed by the parsing facility E may be collected into two or more pools of information for example. One pool may contain parsed personal data E relating to the syndicated information collected by the spider E and the other pool may contain non personal information E e.g. exam results medical history . The pools of information may be used for a variety of reasons. For example the pool containing medical non personal information E may be used by epidemiologists or other healthcare professionals to gather information related to trends or the like without sacrificing privacy of patients or having to rely on obtaining information releases from the many people to whom the information pertains. The information pool containing the personal information relating to the medical information E may be used through a security facility E by itself or to be re associated with the medical information residing in the medical information pool E to generate patient specific reports and the like.

In another embodiment some or all of the health care data may be de personalized and syndicated using the systems described herein. Information needed to personalize data i.e. associate the data with a particular patient or group of patients may be retained at a different location such as a secure data repository. In one embodiment personalization information may be maintained in an outline such as an OPML document. Similarly OPML or the secure data repository may be employed to sort data with partial personalization such as to obtain demographic data or the like. For example a personalization facility may be employed to gather all data for individuals having certain objective characteristics such as a specified age weight gender medical condition or the like without identifying any of the specific individuals for whom data is being provided.

The information provided by the medical information sources E which may be for example any of the medical devices described above may be formatted in a syndication format such as RSS or OPML. The spider E may look for and gather the syndicated information as a result of a targeted syndication search. The parser may parse the information in a number of ways. For example if the syndicated information is provided in an OPML format the parser may extract information relating to the medical condition diagnosis testing prognosis symptoms test results images and the like to be sent to the pooled medical information E while personal information may be extracted and sent to the personal information pool . The personal information may still retain tags or outline parameters that may be used to reconnect the personal information to the non personal medical information in the pooled medical information E.

Continuing to refer to the information pool containing the personal information relating to the medical information E may be used through a security facility E to be re associated with the medical information residing in the medical information pool E to generate patient specific reports and the like. This approach may be employed to review or analyze medical information relating to one or more people through a computer facility EA. It may be appropriate in certain circumstances to obtain consent from In embodiments access to pooled medical information E may be the only information provided and it may be accessed through computer facility EB. Computer EB may also be associated with a security facility not shown . In other embodiments personal information may be correlated to data within the information pools using e.g. an outline grammar such as OPML. A patient record OPML file may be separately and securely maintained. In one embodiment only an authorized medical professional may have access to the patient record OPML file. In another embodiment an owner of the data i.e. the person to whom the data relates may have read only access to the OPML file.

Aspects of the present invention relate to pooling syndicated information. Pools may contain information relating to information that was found in data streams. The information may have been found in the data stream at particular times or in particular places. For example a financial market may produce a stream of data relating to trades made during a trading session and a pool of data extracted from the stream may be produced to be accessed later. As another example medical information may be produced by a medical device and the medical device information may be pushed into a data stream. The medical information from the data stream may be extracted from the stream and loaded into a pool .

Pools of data can be merged with other pools of data to form larger pools e.g. to combine things of like file type semantic meaning etc. . In embodiments pools may be drained and in doing so new data streams may be created. For example streaming a series of offers to sell goods or services securities etc. at a given price out of a pool of such offers. In embodiments the data stream may be buffered until relevant decision points are achieved.

In embodiments a filter may be associated with a pool of data. A pool of data may be created from unfiltered data e.g. an unfiltered data stream then over time the pool can be run through filters to produce a cleaner more relevant pool of data. The filter could be a semantic filter a collaborative filter a logical filter or a human filter such as a community that validates the presence of content in the pool . E.g. a pool could contain good movies that are monitored by a community.

In embodiments pools may be linked to other pools so that one pool spills into the other e.g. a pool of data that takes input from another pool upon occurrence of an event such as availability of a resource for processing e.g. a resource becomes available to process an incoming message requesting help from a software help desk and is handed into a pool of similar requests for handling by someone who is responsible for that type of request . Pools of data can evaporate that is data items can be made to expire from the pool either based on age or based on the right conditions e.g. if a price of a security drops low enough then limit orders may be triggered if time passes an option can expire etc. . Pools may be filled by different sources a main source as well as secondary sources or streams that augment the main source streams .

An aspect of the present invention relates to using syndicated heath related data and health related syndicated data pools . The following embodiments illustrate a few of the envisioned uses of such information.

In embodiments community based health data may be communicated to healthcare professionals the public or other persons or entities through syndication feeds associated with the community based health data. The syndication feeds may consist of syndicated health data collected by community health clinics emergency personnel hospitals hospices nursing homes public health screening sites mobile screening facilities community health drives blood drives school clinics emergency rooms physician offices and or other sites where health data may be collected. Community based health data includes but is not limited to cases of disease such as heart disease cancer diabetes stroke mortality serious accidents child immunizations influenza and so forth. This information may be linked with other demographic data such as age sex race social security number religion area code home address work address billing address credit card information family information birthplace driver s license number employer position and income bracket. Community based health data may be communicated through syndication feeds continuously at set intervals at predetermined intervals upon an event or updated information or at another appropriate time.

In embodiments community based health data may be communicated through a syndicated feed based on syndicated heath data stored in a centralized facility or in several data repositories. The storage and associated data analysis may occur within a community public health clinic state public health clinic university research facility medical school and or national public health entity such as the National Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such a system of reporting may permit macro and micro temporal tracking of health trends.

In embodiments syndication feeds relating to community health status data may be randomly sampled to calculate public health indicators. For example a county public health agency may receive a plurality of syndication feeds containing community health data. The agency may have a need to know about the most prevalent health ailments found among children living in the county. Rather than analyze all the health data available about children it may be advantageous financially and empirically to randomly sample from the available health data. This may reduce the analytic task by lessening the data required for analysis as well as improve the validity of the analysis by permitting the agency to ensure that the data used for analysis adequately represents the community as a whole i.e. minimizes bias . Furthermore the health data may be used by the agency for other public health study formats. For example community health data communicated through syndicated feeds may be used to compute disease incidence disease prevalence identify new outbreaks of disease and or infection calculate the distribution of disease across demographic variables and or identify populations that are vulnerable to future health concerns.

In embodiments syndicated feeds related to community based health status data may be linked to location information such as Global Positioning System GPS data or information relating to a home address or clinic address. This coupling of health and geographic data may permit analysis of environmental factors that may be affecting the health of the community. For example by linking the rates of obesity with the geographic location of the green spaces it may be possible to infer whether there is a relationship between increasing rates of obesity and access to parks and other recreational areas. Similarly environmental data on particulate matter released by local industries may be linked with the location of recent lung cancer cases to assist in determining the influence of air pollution on cancer incidence.

In embodiments syndicated data on community health may be presented for use by health care providers through syndication feeds and the like. For example healthcare facilities such as hospitals may be in need of information on the rates of disease and the distribution of health needs within the population residing in the facility s catchment area. For example when planning its fiscal budget a county hospital may be in need of information to assist it in allocating resources between kidney dialysis services and diabetes treatment. The community health data discoverable through a syndicated feed may indicate declining rates of kidney disease and increasing rates of diabetes thereby increasing the confidence the hospital administrators may have in choosing to divert resources to increase funding for diabetes treatment.

In embodiments health education materials may be made available to the public through syndication feeds that are sent in accordance with health data retrieved during community health screenings. For example during a community health screening patients may have their blood glucose levels checked. For those patients with abnormal glucose levels a syndication data feed regarding proper blood sugar management may be set up for review and or printing by the patient. Additional systems could record which patients receive these educational materials to permit future analyses of the effectiveness of the educational materials in helping patients manage their health. For example when such data is viewed new syndicated data may be developed and sent back to an available pool of such data. An association may be made between the data indicating the material was received and past and or future health care related information.

In embodiments data regarding the clinical practices of healthcare providers and institutions may be stored in a syndicated format. Just as the medical chart currently follows the patient throughout his treatment within an institution so too could a data feed adapted to capture such information from a pool of such syndicated information. A device could syndicate salient information at each step of the treatment process from intake to discharge to follow up consultations. For example upon intake a patient s demographic information may be collected such as age sex race social security number religion area code home address work address billing address credit card information family information birthplace driver s license number employer position and income bracket and the information may be syndicated e.g. tagged to be later retrieved through a syndication feed . Throughout the patient s interaction with the healthcare provider s additional information may be collected and syndicated to be later collected through syndication feeds. This information may include but is not limited to admission time time of first consultation health status diagnosis on intake e.g. ICD 10 code the patient s currently prescribed medications timing of treatment s treatment dosages duration of treatment symptoms change in symptoms health status self assessed health status quality of life time of discharge and morbidity mortality outcomes.

In embodiments data collected about the clinical practices of healthcare providers and institutions communicated through syndication feeds may be stored and analyzed as part of a continuous quality improvement regime to ascertain efficiency. It is necessary for healthcare providers to provide treatment to patients in an efficient manner that optimizes the patient s health while minimizing institutional waste. Information is required to monitor the efficiency of any institution and this is especially important within the field of healthcare due to the many different services and service providers that impact institutional efficiency. Just as the medical chart currently follows the patient throughout his treatment within an institution so too could a syndication by collecting all relevant information from a pool of syndicated data. A device could record salient information at each step of the treatment process from intake to discharge to follow up consultations. Once this information was sent to a storage facility it may be made available for administrators or researchers for analysis of whether services were efficiently provided to patients. Information that may be used in this manner may include but is not limited to admission time time of first consultation health status diagnosis on intake e.g. ICD 10 code the patient s currently prescribed medications timing of treatment s treatment dosages duration of treatment time of discharge and timing of follow up consultations.

In embodiments data collected about the clinical practices of healthcare providers and institutions communicated through syndication feeds may be stored and analyzed as part of a continuous quality improvement regime to ascertain effectiveness.

In embodiments data collected about the clinical practices of healthcare providers and institutions communicated through syndication feeds may be stored and analyzed as part of a continuous quality improvement regime to ascertain the cost effectiveness of services. The clinical data collected from individual patients may be collected syndicated and stored. It may then be monitored in conjunction with a healthcare provider s financial information to determine the cost effectiveness of the treatment s administered. These results may then be compared to national norms for the purposes of benchmarking individual healthcare providers or institutions.

In embodiments data collected about the clinical practices of healthcare providers and institutions communicated through syndication feeds may be stored and analyzed as part of a program to ensure conformance with accepted standards of care. For many clinical conditions there are published standards of care to guide physicians and other healthcare personnel in proper medical decision making. For example blood pressure is considered to be high typically if a patient s systolic pressure is over 120 and or diastolic pressure exceeds 80. Thus a basic standard of care provides that a patient with a blood pressure reading exceeding these levels should be treated for hypertension. However there are many additional factors that must be considered before the healthcare provider can make the appropriate treatment recommendation. For instance the age of the patient the patient s current medications the patient s concurrent morbidities and many other factors influence the decision to treat the hypertension through dietary change exercise medication or some combination of these. A healthcare provider s effectiveness and the effectiveness of the institution within which she serves patients may be determined in part by the degree to which treatment conforms to these standards of care. By using syndicated data to continuously record information about the patient s treatment this information may be accessed in real time or retrospectively and analyzed to determine conformance with accepted standards of care.

In embodiments a syndicated feed relating to data about a patient s course of treatment could trigger alerts to physicians and other healthcare providers when the treatment regimen diverges from the accepted standard of care. For example such information may be used to record a patient s current medications upon intake to a hospital or the medications may be determined through a related syndicated feed. During the course of treatment at the hospital additional data may be added to a pool of syndicated information including new medications that may be administered. Should there be a new medication that is prescribed that has a known negative interaction with a mediation that the patient was currently taking but for whatever reason was not recognized by the healthcare provider an alert could be forwarded by syndicated feed to a physician s device alerting the physician of the potential problem. The algorithms used to determine diversions from accepted clinical standards of care may be stored on a central server or locally on a client for example and act as filters or predictors based on the incoming syndication data relating to the patients records. Furthermore the algorithms may be updated to reflect findings from new clinical research and changing standards of care.

In embodiments syndication feeds may be prospectively used to assist medical decision making. As described herein throughout a patient s clinical treatment data may be collected including admission time time of first consultation health status diagnosis on intake e.g. ICD 10 code the patient s currently prescribed medications timing of treatment s treatment dosages duration of treatment symptoms change in symptoms health status self assessed health status quality of life time of discharge and morbidity mortality outcomes. A healthcare provider may store algorithms on a server reflecting the clinical standards of care for the types of patients treated by that healthcare provider. As data are collected throughout the patient s treatment the incoming syndication feed may be filtered or otherwise associated with these algorithms and used to derive recommendations that may in turn be forward to healthcare providers for consultation during the clinical decision making process. For example medical researchers employed by a hospital may learn through a recent medical journal article that a particular dosage of statins was found to reduce subsequent heart attacks in patients receiving coronary artery bypass surgery. The researchers may manifest this new knowledge in the form of an algorithm that filters or otherwise manipulates all incoming patient syndication data feeds looking for patients that have received bypass surgery and then determining the current dosage of statins that each patient is currently taking. Bypass surgery patients that are not taking statins or that are not taking the correct dosage i.e. is not conforming to the accepted standard of care may be identified and an alert forwarded to a healthcare provider by RSS feed to let the provider know that there is a high probability that this patient should have her statin dosage adjusted. Furthermore the algorithms may be continuously updated to reflect findings from new clinical research and changing standards of care.

In embodiments syndication data streams may be used to optimize enrollment in clinical trials. One of the challenges and significant costs incurred by clinical trials is identifying patients who are appropriate for study. Often there are extensive lists of inclusion criteria based on demographic health status and other indicators that are used to determine which patients are appropriate for enrollment. In addition may clinical trials have complicated stratified trial designs and subject pools that are enrolled across a geographically diverse population requiring extensive coordination to ensure that only appropriate subjects are enrolled and that no class of subjects is over or under enrolled. By using a syndication feed of patients information all indicators that are relevant to the inclusion criteria of a given clinical trial may be continuously monitored. This process of review may be centralized or may occur within each healthcare provider point of patient contact for example. For example upon intake a patient s demographic information may be collected such as age sex race social security number religion area code home address work address billing address credit card information family information birthplace driver s license number employer position and income bracket. Throughout the patient s interaction with the healthcare provider s additional information may be collected and sent via syndication feeds. This information may include but is not limited to admission time time of first consultation health status diagnosis on intake e.g. ICD 10 code the patient s currently prescribed medications timing of treatment s treatment dosages duration of treatment symptoms change in symptoms health status self assessed health status quality of life time of discharge and morbidity mortality outcomes. A clinical trial s inclusion criteria could manifest as an algorithm on a central server against which the individual patients syndicated feed data are compared for compatibility. When there is a match i.e. a patient qualifies for enrollment in a study an alert may be forwarded to an attending physician or other healthcare provider along with information about the study its purpose and requirements of patients. Additionally informed consent forms and other relevant enrollment materials may also be forward via syndication. Following enrollment a duplicate blinded i.e. no personal identifiers other than study ID patient record may be forwarded by syndication to a separate clinical trial data repository.

In embodiments syndication data streams of patient s data may be used to enroll patients in clinical trials by randomizing patients according to the analytic design of the clinical study. For example clinical cohort studies may have a stratified design in which a predetermined number of patients from different age strata are sought for enrollment. By analyzing the demographic data included in the patient feeds it may be possible to more efficiently stratify enrollment while still maintaining randomization. Similarly stratification could be carried out based upon clinical criteria such as disease status severity. Case control studies observational study and or trend analyses may be conducted in a similar manner.

In embodiments syndicated data feeds may be used by patients to communicate health status data to their health care providers from home. Using a device capable of capturing and syndicating data patients may record their symptoms in real time along with relevant health indicators e.g. glucose levels respiratory volume etc. and make the data available to their physician through an associated feed. Similarly patients could record information relating to the timing of taking medications their functional status and so forth. Temporal comparisons may be made to determine the presence of any clinically relevant changes in a patient s health status. Clinically relevant changes in a patient s health status may be used to automatically generate an email to a healthcare provider alerting them to the change. If appropriate an appointment may be scheduled.

In embodiments a syndication feed may be used to alert patients to an upcoming appointment with a healthcare provider.

In embodiments syndication feeds may be used to push medical content and information to patients based upon their medical condition s . For example a healthcare provider may be able to initiate an RSS feed for patients based upon clinical information such as a patient s ICD 10 code. This may be used as a filter to screen information repositories e.g. medical journal databases such as Medline for information that is relevant to a patient. Similarly breaking news from news wire services such as Reuters may also be screened for its relevance to a patient s health condition s . Once aggregated this information may be presented through a feed for review by patients.

In embodiments syndication feeds may be based upon data collected from environmental toxin sensors. For example public health departments may employ a variety of environmental sensors to monitor water air and soil pollutants as well as toxic spills or other sudden changes in environmental status. This data may be stored in syndicated data pools and retrieved in real time via syndication feeds for continuous monitoring. The data may be analyzed for trends and changes over time. The data may be merged with other community data e.g. citizens health status location data GPS data etc. to determine causal patterns and or disease clustering. Similarly environmental monitoring could be carried out within a single home and used to monitor radon levels mildew mold lead dust soil toxins water toxins etc. This information may be communicated through syndication to a homeowner s computer PDA or any other device capable of receiving such feeds.
