This invention was made with government support under U19 CA052995 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The thioredoxin redox couple thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase TR Trx is a ubiquitous redox system found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The thioredoxin system is comprised primarily of two elements thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase. Thioredoxins are a class of low molecular weight redox proteins characterized by a highly conserved Cys Gly Pro Cys Lys active site. The cysteine residues at the active site of thioredoxin undergo reversible oxidation reduction catalyzed by thioredoxin reductase. Trx 1 is ubiquitously expressed with a conserved catalytic site that undergoes reversible NADPH dependent reduction by selenocysteine containing flavoprotein Trx 1 reductases.

The cytosolic thioredoxin redox system is composed of thioredoxin 1 and thioredoxin reductase 1 reductase which catalyzes the NADPH dependent reduction of thioredoxin 1. Thioredoxin reductase 1 is an important regulator of cancer cell growth and survival. Thioredoxin 1 acting with peroxiredoxin 1 is an antioxidant that scavenges HO. Thioredoxins are also able to reduce buried oxidized thiol residues in proteins and regulate the activity of redox sensitive transcription factors including p53 nuclear factor nB the glucocorticoid receptor activator protein 1 hypoxia inducible factor 1 HIF 1 Sp1 and Nrf2. Thioredoxin 1 also binds and inhibits the activity of the apoptosis inducing proteins apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 and the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 thus inhibiting apoptosis. Thioredoxin 1 is overexpressed in many human tumors where it is associated with increased cell proliferation decreased apoptosis and poor patient survival. Thioredoxin reductase thus provides a target to regulate the activity of overexpressed thioredoxin 1.

Thioredoxin reductase 1 is a selenocysteine containing flavoprotein with broad substrate specificity because of the ready accessibility of its COOH terminal redox active site which contains an essential selenocysteine residue. There are three thioredoxin reductase isoforms the canonical cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase 1 a mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase 2 and a testes specific thioredoxin reductase glutathione reductase. The cellular level of thioredoxin reductase 1 is subject to complex regulation. The core promoter of the thioredoxin reductase 1 gene contains several transcription factor activation sites including those for the redox sensitive factors Oct 1 and Sp1 as well as others. Differential splicing and alternative transcription start sites result in multiple forms of the enzyme. Post transcriptional regulation involving a selenocysteine insertion sequence element in the 3V untranslated region directs selenocysteine incorporation which is necessary for enzyme activity thus selenium supplementation can lead to increased thioredoxin reductase 1 activity in cell culture and in selenium deficient animals. Thioredoxin reductase 1 is necessary for cell proliferation. A thioredoxin reductase 1 knockout is embryonic lethal in mice and thioredoxin reductase 1 deficient fibroblasts derived from the thioredoxin reductase 1 embryos do not proliferate in vitro. Furthermore cancer cell growth is inhibited by thioredoxin reductase 1 antisense thioredoxin reductase 1 small interfering RNA and by a mutant redox inactive thioredoxin reductase 1. There are reports that levels of thioredoxin reductase 1 are increased by epidermal growth factor and hypoxia in cancer cells although tumors show only moderately increased levels of thioredoxin reductase 1.

The redox protein thioredoxin 1 Trx 1 has been proven to be a rational target for anticancer therapy involved in promoting both proliferation and angiogenesis inhibiting apoptosis and conferring chemotherapeutic drug resistance. Trx 1 was originally studied for its ability to act as a reducing cofactor for ribonucleotide reductase the first unique step in DNA synthesis. Thioredoxin also exerts specific redox control over a number of transcription factors to modulate their DNA binding and thus to regulate gene transcription. Transcription factors regulated by thioredoxin include but are not limited to NF p53 TFIIIC BZLF1 the glucocorticoid receptor and hypoxia inducible factor 1 HIF 1 . Trx 1 also binds in a redox dependent manner and regulates the activity of enzymes such as apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 protein kinases C dot over and the tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN. Trx 1 expression is increased in several human primary cancers including but not limited to lung colon cervix liver pancreatic colorectal and squamous cell cancer. Clinically increased Trx 1 levels have been linked to aggressive tumor growth inhibition of apoptosis and decreased patient survival.

Regulation of the thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase Trx 1 TrxR system is attracting increasing interest due to its implication in cancer HIV AIDS and rheumatoid arthritis along with other medical conditions. The naphthoquinone spiroketal pharmacophore of the palmarumycin family of fungal metabolites holds promising biological activity against the Trx 1 TrxR system.

Pentacyclic palmarumycins are structurally unique natural products with both antifungal and antibacterial activities but their anti neoplastic effects are not well established. Compounds such as auranofin palmarumycin CP 1 3 bis 2 chloroethyl 1 nitrosourea and AW464 have been shown to inhibit either thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase or both. Embodiments of the invention relate to analogues of the palmarumycin family. Further embodiments relate to the ability of the palmarumycin analogues to inhibit the thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase Trx 1 TrxR redox system. These analogues are tested for their ability to inhibit tumor growth in vivo with and their use as a therapeutic agent. Additionally embodiments provide use of palmarumycin analogues that inhibit Trx1 TrxR redox system to be used as lead compounds for the development of other therapeutic agents.

Methods for the inhibition of Trx1 TrxR redox system are also contemplated. Inhibition of Trx1 TrxR redox system may lead to inhibition of tumor growth with the subsequent development of therapeutic agents. Inhibition of Trx TrxR redox system may also lead to inhibition of cellular transcription factors providing therapeutic compounds or lead compounds for the discovery of therapeutic compounds for the treatment of medical conditions such as diabetic neuropathy Sjogren s syndrome HIV AIDS rheumatoid arthritis reperfusion injury or uncontrolled proliferation as exemplified by cancer.

Since its discovery in the early 1960s the thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase system has been the subject of intense pharmacological studies. The two redox active proteins have been isolated from many species and their medical interest is based in part on their value as indicators of widespread diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis AIDS and cancer. The cytosolic 12 kDa thioredoxin 1 Trx 1 is the major cellular protein disulfide reductase and its dithiol disulfide active site cysteine pair CXXC serves as an electron donor for enzymes such as but not limited to ribonucleotide reductase methionine sulfoxide reductase and transcription factors including NF and the Ref 1 dependent AP 1. Therefore thioredoxin 1 is important for cellular redox regulation signaling and regulation of protein function as well as defense against oxidative stress and control of growth and apoptosis.

Thioredoxin 1 acts in concert with the glutathione glutathione reductase system but with a rate of reaction orders of magnitude faster. Eukaryotic thioredoxin reductases TrxR are 112 130 kDa selenium dependent dimeric flavoproteins that also reduce substrates such as hydroperoxides or vitamin C. These reductases contain redox active selenylsulfide selenolthiol active sites and are inhibited by aurothioglucose and auranofin. NADPH serves as reducing agent of thioredoxin by thioredoxin reductase.

Pathophysiological effects of Trx 1 TrxR are indicated by Trx 1 overexpression in human tumors such as but not limited to lung colorectal and cervical cancers and leukemia. Secreted Trx 1 stimulates cancer cell growth and decreases sensitivity to induced apoptosis. The Trx 1 TrxR system is therefore an important target for chemotherapeutic intervention. Although inhibitors of TrxR such as auranofin and nitrosoureas are quite effective the search for new more specific and less toxic compounds is ongoing.

Embodiments of the invention provide new chemical compounds that inhibit the activity of the Trx 1 TrxR redox system. Such compounds may be useful as therapeutic agents pharmacological probes and or lead compounds for the development of therapeutic agents. These compounds may include inhibitors of the thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase system which are less toxic than currently available Trx 1 TrxR redox inhibiting compounds.

Such compounds may be useful as therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions that optionally contain a pharmaceutical excipient or carrier.

Each of the foregoing compounds may be useful as therapeutic agents pharmaceutical compositions or diagnostic agents.

Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method of inhibiting a thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase system comprising administering an effective amount of a palmarumycin analog having the general formula 

Rmay be OH OCH O CH nCH OCH CH CHnCH wherein n is 1 4 OCHCH morpholino OC O CHNH OC O CH CH NH. OC O CH CH CH NH. OC O CH CHPhenyl NH OC O CH CHp OHPhenyl NH

Rmay be a hydrogen NHNHC CH CONHor a carbon carbon bond with the proviso that if Ris OH and Ris a carbon carbon bond Ris not OH or salts thereof. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to HCl TFA tosylate or any other pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

In another embodiment methods of inhibiting thioredoxin reductase 1 by administering a palmarumycin analog described herein is provided. In another embodiment such compounds may be useful in methods of treating diseases associated with the overexpression of thioredoxin 1 including but not limited to cancer increased cell proliferation and apoptosis by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a palmarumycin analog as described herein.

The compounds may be administered in an effective amount to a subject in need of such treatment. As such the compounds described herein may be useful for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders. Administration of the compounds in the form of a therapeutic agent may be carried out using oral enteral parenteral or topical administration including for example intravenous oral transdermal or any other modes of administration optionally with a pharmaceutical excipient.

Pharmaceutical compositions can be used in the preparation of individual dosage forms. Consequently pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention may comprise the active ingredients disclosed herein i.e. thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase inhibitors preferably palmarumycin analogs more preferably a O glycyl naphthoquinone spiroketal PX 916 . Further embodiments of the invention may comprise any therapeutic compound and or therapeutic regiment which is to be assessed for its efficacy in inhibiting a tumor. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can further comprise one or more excipients.

Single unit dosage forms of the invention are suitable for oral mucosal e.g. nasal sublingual vaginal buccal or rectal parenteral e.g. subcutaneous intravenous bolus injection intramuscular or intraarterial or transdermal administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include but are not limited to tablets caplets capsules such as soft elastic gelatin capsules cachets troches lozenges dispersions suppositories ointments cataplasms poultices pastes powders dressings creams plasters solutions patches aerosols e.g. nasal sprays or inhalers gels liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient including suspensions e.g. aqueous or non aqueous liquid suspensions oil in water emulsions or a water in oil liquid emulsions solutions and elixirs liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient and sterile solids e.g. crystalline or amorphous solids that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.

The composition shape and type of dosage forms of the invention will typically vary depending on their use. For example a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms encompassed by this invention will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th ed. Mack Publishing Easton Pa. 1990 .

Typical pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprise one or more excipients. Suitable excipients are well known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy and non limiting examples of suitable excipients are provided herein. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well known in the art including but not limited to the way in which the dosage form will be administered to a patient. For example oral dosage forms such as tablets may contain excipients not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms. The suitability of a particular excipient may also depend on the specific active ingredients in the dosage form. For example the decomposition of some active ingredients may be accelerated by some excipients such as lactose or when exposed to water. Active ingredients that comprise primary or secondary amines are particularly susceptible to such accelerated decomposition.

The invention further encompasses pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise one or more compounds that reduce the rate by which an active ingredient will decompose. Such compounds which are referred to herein as stabilizers include but are not limited to antioxidants such as ascorbic acid pH buffers or salt buffers.

Like the amounts and types of excipients the amounts and specific types of active ingredients in a dosage form may differ depending on factors such as but not limited to the route by which it is to be administered to patients. However typical dosage forms of the invention comprise an amount preferably in a range from about 0.05 mg kg day to about 5 000 mg kg day more preferably in a range from about 0.5 mg kg day to about 500 mg kg day more preferably in a range of about 1 mg kg day to about 50 mg kg day and more preferably yet the therapeutically effective amount is in a range from about 2 mg kg day to about 30 mg kg day.

The compounds of the invention are preferably administered in effective amounts. An effective amount is that amount of a preparation that alone or together with further doses produces the desired response. This may involve only slowing the progression of the disease temporarily although preferably it involves halting the progression of the disease permanently or delaying the onset of or preventing the disease or condition from occurring. This can be monitored by routine methods. Generally doses of active compounds would be from about 0.01 mg kg per day to 1000 mg kg per day. It is expected that doses ranging from 20 500 mg kg will be suitable preferably intravenously intramuscularly or intradermally and in one or several administrations per day.

In general routine experimentation in clinical trials will determine specific ranges for optimal therapeutic effect for each therapeutic agent and each administrative protocol and administration to specific patients will be adjusted to within effective and safe ranges depending on the patient condition and responsiveness to initial administrations. However the ultimate administration protocol will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age condition and size of the patient the compound potencies the duration of the treatment and the severity of the disease being treated. For example a dosage regimen of the palmarumycin analogs preferably an O glycyl naphthoquinone spiroketal PX 916 can be oral administration of from 1 mg kg to 2000 mg kg day preferably 1 to 1000 mg kg day more preferably 50 to 600 mg kg day in two to four preferably two divided doses to reduce tumor growth. Intermittent therapy e.g. one week out of three weeks or three out of four weeks may also be used.

In the event that a response in a subject is insufficient at the initial doses applied higher doses or effectively higher doses by a different more localized delivery route may be employed to the extent that the patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds. Generally a maximum dose is used that is the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand however that a patient may insist upon a lower dose or tolerable dose for medical reasons psychological reasons or for virtually any other reason.

The development of therapeutics typically begins with the identification of an active or lead compound that exhibits some of the properties required for safe and effective therapeutic intervention. Compounds with improved properties are subsequently derived through iterative cycles of analog preparation and testing. Lead compounds are often identified using high throughput screening HTS whereby large libraries containing about tens to thousands or more compounds are tested using relatively simple assays to measure inhibition of processes critical to the target indication in this case inhibition of the Trx1 TrxR redox system. Typically this means using biochemical assays to measure the function of one or more macromolecular targets.

All lead compounds share a common property in the present invention to inhibit the Trx1 TrxR redox system. Screening by assaying for the inhibition of the Trx1 TrxR redox system identifies a small subset of compounds which can be further studied. All compounds from the original library should be identified. Therefore when multiple biochemical activities of the target the Trx1 TrxR redox system are known all the activities of each compound can be measured separately without the prohibitive effort that may be needed to screen the entire library using multiple functional assays.

HTS permit screening of large numbers i.e. tens to thousands or more of compounds in an efficient manner. Automated and miniaturized HTS assays are particularly preferred. ITS assays are designed to identify hits or lead compounds having the desired inhibitory property from which modifications can be designed to improve the desired property. Chemical modification of the hit or lead compound is often based on an identifiable structure activity relationship between the hit and one or more of the palmarumycin analogues.

There are a number of different libraries used for the identification of specific small molecule inhibitors including 1 chemical libraries 2 natural product libraries and 3 combinatorial libraries comprised of random peptides oligonucleotides or organic molecules.

Chemical libraries consist of structural analogs of known compounds or compounds that are identified as hits or leads via natural product screening. Natural product libraries are derived from collections of microorganisms animals plants or marine organisms which are used to create mixtures for screening by 1 fermentation and extraction of broths from soil plant or marine microorganisms or 2 extraction of plants or marine organisms. Natural product libraries may include metabolites of a microorganism such as fungal metabolites for example. Combinatorial libraries are composed of large numbers of peptides oligonucleotides or organic compounds as a mixture. They are relatively easy to prepare by traditional automated synthesis methods.

Various analogues of palmarumycin CP were tested against two human breast cancer cell lines and several members displayed potent effects in inhibiting cell proliferation. A second generation series of palmarumycin CPanalogues showed increased in vitro activity but failed to reduce tumor growth in vivo. This lack of correlation between enzyme and animal assays may be attributed to the low water solubility and limited bioavailability of the natural product lead structure palmarumycin CP . Polar prodrug molecules with improved solubility and antitumor activity were then synthesized.

Typical solubilizing functions in prodrug derivatives include but are not limited to phosphonate or phosphate esters amino acid esters phenolic acetates and various other acyl groups. Starting with the naphthoquinone spiroketal scaffold 5 the phenolic groups were used to introduce a charged hydrolytically cleavable function. Coupling of compounds 5 and 6 herein referred to as PX 960 with various Boc protected amino acids proceeded in good yield and high regioselectivity . Only the phenolic hydroxy group distal from the carbonyl functionality in 6 PX 960 was acylated under the DCC mediated esterification conditions. This regioselectivity can be attributed to strong hydrogen bonding between the phenol and the carbonyl oxygen as well as the inductive attenuation of the nucleophilicity at this site. Following esterification the carbamate was removed with 20 trifluoroacetate TFA in dichloromethane to afford a series of TFA salts which were tested for their ability to inhibit thioredoxin reductase along with general cytotoxicity.

In addition to amino esters the introduction of a tertiary amine in the form of a morpholine heterocycle was also investigated . Once again selective monoetherification was observed at the hydroxyl group distal from the carbonyl group. Compounds 13 and 14 were also subjected to biological evaluation.

As expected all naphthoquinone spiroketal prodrugs 10 14 showed fundamentally equivalent low micromolar ICvalues for MCF 7 cell growth inhibition compared to the parent phenol 6 PX 960 Table 1 . In vitro inhibition of the thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase system was more variable and none of the prodrugs accomplished the nanomolar level of activity of PX 960 the parent compound with glycyl prodrug 12 herein referred to as PX 916 being the notable exception. Different amounts of the active drug may be released from the prodrug during the enzyme assays by spontaneous hydrolysis. However prodrug PX 916 was considerably more water soluble 0.7 mg mL vs 5 d. In water at room temperature and pH4 PX 916 had a t 37 h but it was rapidly broken down at pH 7 and above t

Because of the promising biological profile of prodrug PX 916 the enantiomers of the spirocycle PX 960 were resolved to test if they exhibited differential biological activities. The most direct approach would be a separation via chiral HPLC. The low solubility that plagued the biological testing of PX 960 limited the efforts towards chiral separation on a multi milligram scale. However small quantities 1 mg of enantiomerically pure PX 960 could be obtained with a Chiralcel AD H column and both enantiomers demonstrated comparable in vitro activity. Since the difference in the absolute configuration of PX 960 relates to the spatial orientation of the naphthaline ketal the lack of enantioselectivity in the biological assay supports the hypothesis that this group is not primarily involved in any activity determining interactions. Accordingly the naphthaline ketal represents a preferred site for chemical changes that target the optimization of physicochemical properties.

The water soluble reversible prodrug derivatives of potent inhibitors of the thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase system were synthesized in a convergent fashion. The O glycyl naphthoquinone spiroketal PX 916 demonstrated equivalent biological activity compared to the previous lead structure PX 960 in the in vivo MCF 7 tumor model as well as in the thioredoxin reductase inhibition assay. Moreover PX 916 had 1 2 orders of magnitude improved aqueous solubility and while stable at pH 4 rapidly released the active compound under physiological conditions.

General procedure for coupling reactions. To a partial suspension of spirocycle 6 PX 960 92 mg 0.28 mmol in CHCl 6 mL was added N tert butoxycarbonyl glycine 58 mg 0.33 mmol DCC 74 mg 0.36 mmol and DMAP 7 mg 0.06 mmol . The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h as the starting material gradually dissolved and a white precipitate was formed. The cloudy solution was filtered rinsed with CHCland concentrated under reduced pressure.

Retention times for the two 6 PX 960 enantiomers on an AD H column in 14 i PrOH Hexanes were 8.27 min and 10.07 min respectively.

Stability. PX 916 was stable as a stock solution in ethanol at room temperature with a half life of 5 days. However in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer PX 916 showed pH dependent degradation with a half life at pH 4.0 of 37 hr at pH 7.0 a half life of 1 hr and at pH 10.0 a half life of 

Inhibition of TR. PX 916 was a potent inhibitor of purified human TR with an ICof 0.28 M which is similar to that of palmarumycin Table 2 . However unlike palmarumycin which is almost insoluble in aqueous media PX 916 is soluble with an apparent maximum solubility in water of around 10 mg. Based upon the observation that PX 916 was rapidly converted to PX 960 in aqueous solution the ability of PX 960 to inhibit purified human TR was measured and found to be similar to that of PX 916 Table 2 . PX 916 was a selective inhibitor of human TR compared to two other NADPH dependent reductases with a selectivity of at least 200 for human glutathione reductase and human cytochrome P450 reductase Table 3 .

In vitro activity. Cell growth inhibition of MCF 7 human breast cancer cells by palmarumycin PX 916 and PX 960 occurred at similar concentration of 1 to 3 M Table 2 . MCF 7 human breast cancer cells were grown in medium containing 1 M selenium Se for 7 days which increased cellular thioredoxin reductase activity by about 5 fold as previously reported. When the cells were exposed to 1 M PX 916 there was a time dependent inhibition of cellular TR that was maximum at 24 hr . The ICfor inhibition of cellular TR by PX 916 was 0.25 M and maximum inhibition occurred at 0.5 M . Thus inhibition of purified human TR MCF 7 cellular TR and cell growth inhibition of MCF 7 cells by PX 916 occurred at about the same concentrations.

In vivo inhibition of tumor TR and antitumor activity. A single intravenous i.v. dose of PX 916 of 25 mg kg inhibited MCF 7 human tumor xenograft TR up to about 60 at 24 hr and the inhibition was maintained for at least 48 hr . The growth of A 673 human rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts SE n 6 mice was decreased from 153 35 mm d in the vehicle control to 5 3 mm d for 5 days after dosing with PX 916 at 30 mg kg d ip for five doses 97 inhibition P 0.01 . PX 916 administered i.v. showed good antitumor activity against the SHP 77 small cell lung cancer with a decrease in tumor growth rate 5 days after the end of dosing SE n 8 mice from about 150 48 mm day in vehicle control to 27 mm day when administered at 25 mg kg i.v. daily for 5 doses 82 inhibition P

Tumor HIF 1 and VEGF. Levels of the HIF 1 transcription factor and its downstream target VEGF are increased by thioredoxin 1 expression. We examined the effect of PX 916 administration on tumor HIF 1 and VEGF levels . Twenty four hours after the last dose of five daily doses of PX 916 of 25 mg kg there was a decrease in MCF 7 xenograft staining for both HIF 1 and VEGF. At the same time levels of tumor thioredoxin reductase activity were decreased by 75 .

Toxicity. A single i.v. dose of PX 916 of 50 mg kg to female scid mice was lethal. However female scid mice tolerated 5 daily doses of PX 916 of 25 mg kg i.v. The major toxicities observed 24 hr after the last dose was neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with no observable increase in plasma liver enzymes and no significant weight loss Table 4 .

Pharmacokinetics. When incubated with fresh mouse plasma at room temperature PX 960 had a half life of about 31 minutes at room temperature while PX 916 rapidly disappeared and was converted to PX 960 with a half life of less than 2.0 minutes. When PX 916 was administered to mice at 25 mg g i.v. it could not be detected in plasma 5 minutes after administration and only a very small peak of the parent compound PX 960 could be detected at 5 minutes. No PX 960 was detected at 30 minutes. Two metabolite peaks could be seen at 5 minutes but were undetectable by 30 minutes.

PX 916 was synthesized as a water soluble prodrug of the palmarumycin analog PX 960 and was found to retain the ability to inhibit purified TrxR with an ICof 0.28 M. PX 916 also inhibited TrxR activity in MCF 7 human breast cancer cells with an ICof 0.25 M and was an inhibitor of MCF 7 cell growth with an ICof 3.1 M. PX 916 was an NADPH and time dependent apparently irreversible inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase 1 most likely reacting with the selenocysteine containing catalytic site. Two other NADPH dependent reductases human glutathione reductase and cytochrome P 450 reductase were not inhibited by PX 916 until concentrations were increased to greater than 100 fold higher.

Stability studies showed that at physiological pH PX 916 was stable for about 1 hr and slowly converted to its parent PX 960 with a half life of 1 hr. It was much more stable at pH 4.0 and was formulated at this pH for i.v. administration. In mouse plasma the breakdown of PX 916 to PX 960 was rapid with a half life less than 2 minutes. Thus the inhibition of TrxR in tumor xenografts and the antitumor activity is likely to be almost completely due to the parent PX 960. PX 960 could be detected only transiently in mouse plasma after administration of PX 916 due to rapid metabolism or likely rapid distribution of the very lipophilic PX 960. Thus PX 916 provides a novel soluble and stable prodrug for the administration of PX 960.

When a single dose of 25 mg kg was administered to mice with MCF 7 breast cancer xenografts the tumor TrxR activity was inhibited by up to 60 and remained inhibited for 48 hr. Repeated administration of PX 916 for five 5 days gave 75 inhibition of tumor thioredoxin reductase 24 hrs after the last dose.

PX 916 given i.p. or i.v. showed antitumor activity against A673 rhabdomyosarcoma SHP 77 small cell lung cancer and MCF 7 breast cancer. In SHP 77 complete tumor regressions were seen in some mice. The most active schedule was every other day administration and tumor growth was inhibited as long as the drug was given. Significant antitumor activity was not seen following oral administration at doses that gave i.v. antitumor activity. Thioredoxin 1 acts by a redox mechanism to increase HIF 1 levels and VEGF formation associated with an increase in tumor angiogenesis and this effect was reversed by a thioredoxin 1 inhibitor. MCF 7 tumor xenografts in mice treated with PX 916 showed a decrease in tumor HIF 1 and VEGF presumably due to the inhibition of thioredoxin 1 redox signaling. Inhibition of thioredoxin reductase 1 might affect other pathways in the cell. A recent study using small interfering RNA to knockdown thioredoxin reductase 1 expression and microarray analysis showed changes in leukotriene B4 12 hydroxydehydrogenase ubiquitin D differentiation enhancing factor fibronectin 1 apolipoprotein 3 prosaposin choline ethanolamine phosphotransferase and IFN a inducible protein genes.

PX 916 a water soluble prodrug of a palmarumycin CP1 analogue rapidly releases the parent compound at physiologic pH and in plasma but is stable at acid pH allowing its i.v. administration. PX 916 is an inhibitor of purified human thioredoxin reductase 1 and of thioredoxin reductase activity in cells and tumor xenografts when given to mice. PX 916 exhibited antitumor activity against several animal tumor models with some cures and blocked the expression of the downstream targets of thioredoxin 1 signaling HIF 1 and VEGF in the tumors.

Further palmarumycin analogs were synthesized and tested. The following analogs were synthesized eee269 II eee86 M eee263 11 and eee273 II. The stability of the analogs was measured in various solutions. The stability of 100 g ml of compound in a 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer is presented in Table 5 below.

The stability of the analogs in ethanol is presented in . The stability of the analogs and formation of the parent compound in plasma was measured and is presented in and Table 6 measured by the formation of parent compound over the first 20 min of incubation at 1 mg ml and at 33 C. below. As shown below eee273 II appears very insoluble at 1 mg ml but not studied in mouse plasma and eee269 II was not studied in plasma because it is unstable in aqueous solutions.
