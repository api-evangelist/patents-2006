For the purposes of location and identification US patents patent applications identified by their US patent patent application serial numbers are listed alongside the Australian applications from which the US patents patent applications claim the right of priority.

Many different types of printing have been invented a large number of which are presently in use. The known forms of print have a variety of methods for marking the print media with a relevant marking media. Commonly used forms of printing include offset printing laser printing and copying devices dot matrix type impact printers thermal paper printers film recorders thermal wax printers dye sublimation printers and ink jet printers both of the drop on demand and continuous flow type. Each type of printer has its own advantages and problems when considering cost speed quality reliability simplicity of construction and operation etc.

In recent years the field of ink jet printing wherein each individual pixel of ink is derived from one or more ink nozzles has become increasingly popular primarily due to its inexpensive and versatile nature.

Many different techniques on ink jet printing have been invented. For a survey of the field reference is made to an article by J Moore Non Impact Printing Introduction and Historical Perspective Output Hard Copy Devices Editors R Dubeck and S Sherr pages 207 220 1988 .

Ink Jet printers themselves come in many different types. The utilisation of a continuous stream ink in ink jet printing appears to date back to at least 1929 wherein U.S. Pat. No. 1 941 001 by Hansell discloses a simple form of continuous stream electrostatic ink jet printing.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 596 275 by Sweet also discloses a process of a continuous ink jet printing including the step wherein the ink jet stream is modulated by a high frequency electro static field so as to cause drop separation. This technique is still used by several manufacturers including Elmjet and Scitex see also U.S. Pat. No. 3 373 437 by Sweet et al 

Piezoelectric ink jet printers are also one form of commonly used ink jet printing device. Piezoelectric systems are disclosed by Kyser et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3 946 398 1970 which discloses a diaphragm mode of operation by Zolten in U.S. Pat. No. 3 683 212 1970 which discloses a squeeze mode of operation of a piezoelectric crystal Stemme in U.S. Pat. No. 3 747 120 1972 which discloses a bend mode of piezoelectric operation Howkins in U.S. Pat. No. 4 459 601 which discloses a piezoelectric push mode actuation of the ink jet stream and Fischbeck in U.S. Pat. No. 4 584 590 which discloses a shear mode type of piezoelectric transducer element.

Recently thermal ink jet printing has become an extremely popular form of ink jet printing. The ink jet printing techniques include those disclosed by Endo et al in GB 2007162 1979 and Vaught et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4 490 728. Both the aforementioned references disclose ink jet printing techniques rely upon the activation of an electrothermal actuator which results in the creation of a bubble in a constricted space such as a nozzle which thereby causes the ejection of ink from an aperture connected to the confined space onto a relevant print media. Printing devices using the electro thermal actuator are manufactured by manufacturers such as Canon and Hewlett Packard.

As can be seen from the foregoing many different types of printing technologies are available. Ideally a printing technology should have a number of desirable attributes. These include inexpensive construction and operation high speed operation safe and continuous long term operation etc. Each technology may have its own advantages and disadvantages in the areas of cost speed quality reliability power usage simplicity of construction operation durability and consumables.

The valve assembly that forms the basis of this invention facilitates the achievement of a number of the desirable attributes listed above.

According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided an elongate actuator for moving a closure member in a micro electromechanical valve assembly for controlling a flow of fluid through a fluid supply channel the channel being defined by a wafer substrate and drive circuitry layers positioned on the wafer substrate and terminating at a fluid supply opening the actuator having a first end anchored to the wafer substrate so as to be in electrical contact with at least one of the drive circuitry layers and a second end connected to the closure member so as to move it between a closed position in which the closure member covers the fluid supply opening and ink is inhibited from flowing through the fluid supply channel and an open position in which the fluid supply opening is opened to allow the ink to flow through the fluid supply channel wherein

at least a portion of the actuator in a rest condition has an arcuate shape and is configured to be heated upon receiving an electrical current from the drive circuitry such that when the portion is heated it expands and causes the actuator to straighten sufficiently to displace the closure member from closed to an open position and a subsequent cooling of the portion after the current is discontinued causes the actuator to return to its rest condition returning the closure to the closed position.

According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a micro electromechanical valve assembly for controlling a flow of fluid through a fluid supply channel defined in a wafer substrate and drive circuitry layers positioned on the wafer substrate and terminating at a fluid supply opening the valve assembly comprising 

an elongate actuator that is anchored at one end to the wafer substrate to be in electrical contact with the drive circuitry layers and

a closure member that is mounted on an opposite end of the elongate actuator the actuator being configured to receive an electrical signal from the drive circuitry layer to displace the closure member between a closed position in which the closure member covers the fluid supply opening and ink is inhibited from flowing through the fluid supply channel and an open position wherein

the elongate actuator is shaped so that in a rest condition the actuator encloses an arc the actuator including a heating portion that is capable of being heated on receipt of the electrical signal to expand the heating portion being configured so that when the portion is heated the resultant expansion of the portion causes the actuator to straighten at least partially and a subsequent cooling of the portion causes the actuator to return to its rest condition thereby displacing the closure between the closed and open positions.

Each actuator may include a body portion that is of a resiliently flexible material having a coefficient of thermal expansion which is such that the material can expand to perform work when heated the heating portion being positioned in the body portion and defining a heating circuit of a suitable metal.

The heating circuit may include a heater and a return trace the heater being positioned proximate an inside edge of the body portion and the return trace being positioned outwardly of the heater so that an inside region of the body portion is heated to a relatively greater extent with the result that the inside region expands to a greater extent than a remainder of the body portion.

The body portion may be of polytetrafluoroethylene and the heating circuit may be of copper Each actuator may define a coil that partially uncoils when the heating portion expands.

In accordance with a third aspect of the present invention there is provided an inkjet nozzle comprising an ink ejection port for the ejection of ink an ink supply with an oscillating ink pressure interconnected to the ink ejection port a shutter mechanism interconnected between the ink supply and the ink ejection port which blocks the ink ejection port and an actuator mechanism for moving the shutter mechanism on demand away from the ink ejection port so as to allow for the ejection of ink on demand from the ink ejection port.

In another embodiment of the invention there is provided a method of operating an ink jet printhead that includes a plurality of nozzle arrangements and an ink reservoir each nozzle arrangement having 

Further the actuator preferably comprises a thermal actuator which is activated by the heating of one side of the actuator. Preferably the actuator has a coiled form and is uncoiled upon heating. The actuator includes a serpentine heater element encased in a material having a high coefficient of thermal expansion. The serpentine heater concertinas upon heating. Advantageously the actuator includes a thick return trace for the serpentine heater element. The material in which the serpentine heater element is encased comprises polytetrafluoroethylene. The actuator is formed within a nozzle chamber which is formed on a silicon wafer and ink is supplied to the ejection port through channels etched through the silicon wafer.

In the preferred embodiment an oscillating ink reservoir pressure is used to eject ink from ejection nozzles. Each nozzle has an associated shutter which normally blocks the nozzle. The shutter is moved away from the nozzle by an actuator whenever an ink drop is to be fired.

Turning initially to there is illustrated in exploded perspective a single ink jet nozzle as constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The exploded perspective illustrates a single ink jet nozzle . Ideally the nozzles are formed as an array on a silicon wafer . The silicon wafer is processed so as to have two level metal CMOS circuitry which includes metal layers and glass layers and which are planarised after construction. The CMOS metal layer has a reduced aperture for the access of ink from the back of silicon wafer via an ink supply channel .

A bottom nitride layer is constructed on top of the CMOS layer so as to cover protect and passivate the CMOS layer from subsequent etching processes. Subsequently there is provided a copper heater layer which is sandwiched between two polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layers . The copper layer is connected to lower CMOS layer through vias . The copper layer and PTFE layers are encapsulated within nitride borders e.g. and nitride top layer which includes an ink ejection port in addition to a number of sacrificial etched access holes which are of a smaller dimension than the ejection port and are provided for allowing access of a etchant to lower sacrificial layers thereby allowing the use of the etchant in the construction of layers and .

Turning now to there is shown a cutaway perspective view of a fully constructed ink jet nozzle . The ink jet nozzle uses an oscillating ink pressure to eject ink from ejection port . Each nozzle has an associated shutter which normally blocks it. The shutter is moved away from the ejection port by an actuator whenever an ink drop is to be fired.

The ports are in communication with ink chambers which contain the actuators . These chambers are connected to ink supply channels which are etched through the silicon wafer. The ink supply channels are substantially wider than the ports to reduce the fluidic resistance to the ink pressure wave. The ink channels are connected to an ink reservoir. An ultrasonic transducer for example a piezoelectric transducer is positioned in the reservoir. The transducer oscillates the ink pressure at approximately 100 KHz. The ink pressure oscillation is sufficient that ink drops would be ejected from the nozzle were it not blocked by the shutter .

The shutters are moved by a thermoelastic actuator . The actuators are formed as a coiled serpentine copper heater embedded in polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE . PTFE has a very high coefficient of thermal expansion approximately 770 10 . The current return trace from the heater is also embedded in the PTFE actuator the current return trace is made wider than the heater trace and is not serpentine. Therefore it does not heat the PTFE as much as the serpentine heater does. The serpentine heater is positioned along the inside edge of the PTFE coil and the return trace is positioned on the outside edge. When actuated the inside edge becomes hotter than the outside edge and expands more. This results in the actuator uncoiling.

The heater layer is etched in a serpentine manner both to increase its resistance and to reduce its effective tensile strength along the length of the actuator. This is so that the low thermal expansion of the copper does not prevent the actuator from expanding according to the high thermal expansion characteristics of the PTFE.

By varying the power applied to the actuator the shutter can be positioned between the fully on and fully off positions. This may be used to vary the volume of the ejected drop. Drop volume control may be used either to implement a degree of continuous tone operation to regulate the drop volume or both.

When data signals distributed on the printhead indicate that a particular nozzle is turned on the actuator is energized which moves the shutter so that it is not blocking the ink chamber. The peak of the ink pressure variation causes the ink to be squirted out of the nozzle . As the ink pressure goes negative ink is drawn back into the nozzle causing drop break off. The shutter is kept open until the nozzle is refilled on the next positive pressure cycle. It is then shut to prevent the ink from being withdrawn from the nozzle on the next negative pressure cycle.

Each drop ejection takes two ink pressure cycles. Preferably half of the nozzles should eject drops in one phase and the other half of the nozzles should eject drops in the other phase. This minimises the pressure variations which occur due to a large number of nozzles being actuated.

Referring to the operation of the printhead is described in greater detail. The printhead comprises an array of nozzle arrangements or nozzles two of which are shown as . and . in . Each nozzle arrangement has a chamber in which its associated shutter is arranged.

Each chamber is in communication with an ink reservoir via an ink supply channel . An ultrasonic transducer in the form of a piezoelectric transducer is arranged n the ink reservoir .

As described above each ink drop ejection takes two ink pressure cycles. The two ink pressure cycles are referred to as a phase. Half of the nozzles should eject ink drops in one phase with the other half of the nozzles ejecting ink drops in the other phase.

Consequently as shown in of the drawings the shutter . of the nozzle . is in an open position while the shutter . of the nozzle . is in its closed position. It will be appreciated that the nozzle . represents all the open nozzles of the array of the printhead while the nozzle . represents all the closed nozzles of the array of the printhead.

In a first pressure cycle the transducer is displaced in the direction of arrows imparting positive pressure to the ink in the reservoir and via the channels the chambers of the nozzles . Due to the fact that the shutter . of the nozzle . is open ink in the ink ejection port . bulges outwardly as shown by the meniscus . After a predetermined interval the transducer reverses direction to move in the direction of arrows as shown in of the drawings. This causes necking as shown at resulting in separation of the ink drop due to a first negative going pressure cycle imparted to the ink .

In the second positive pressure cycle as shown in of the drawings with the transducer moving again in the direction of arrow the positive pressure applied to the ink results in a refilling of the chamber . of the nozzle .. It is to be noted that the shutter . is still in an open position with the shutter . still being in a closed position. In this cycle no ink is ejected from either nozzle . or ..

Before the second negative pressure cycle as shown in of the drawings the shutter . moves to its closed position. Then as the transducer again moves in the direction of arrows to impart negative pressure to the ink a slight concave meniscus is formed at both ink ejection ports . and . However due to the fact that both shutters . and . are closed withdrawal of ink from the chambers . and . of the nozzles . and . respectively is inhibited.

The amplitude of the ultrasonic transducer can be altered in response to the viscosity of the ink which is typically affected by temperature and the number of drops which are to be ejected in the current cycle. This amplitude adjustment can be used to maintain consistent drop size in varying environmental conditions.

The drop firing rate can be around 50 KHz. The ink jet head is suitable for fabrication as a monolithic page wide printhead. shows a single nozzle of a 1600 dpi printhead in up shooter configuration.

Returning again to one method of construction of the ink jet print nozzles will now be described. Starting with the bottom wafer layer the wafer is processed so as to add CMOS layers with an aperture being inserted. The nitride layer is laid down on top of the CMOS layers so as to protect them from subsequent etchings.

A thin sacrificial glass layer is then laid down on top of nitride layers followed by a first PTFE layer the copper layer and a second PTFE layer . Then a sacrificial glass layer is formed on top of the PTFE layer and etched to a depth of a few microns to form the nitride border regions . Next the top layer is laid down over the sacrificial layer using the mask for forming the various holes including the processing step of forming the rim on nozzle . The sacrificial glass is then dissolved away and the channel formed through the wafer by means of utilisation of high density low pressure plasma etching such as that available from Surface Technology Systems.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed using the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer complete drive transistors data distribution and timing circuits using a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . The wafer is passivated with 0.1 microns of silicon nitride . This step is shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced inkjet configurations.

19. Etch the sacrificial material. The nozzle chambers are cleared the actuators freed and the chips are separated by this etch. This step is shown in .

20. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer. The package also includes a piezoelectric actuator attached to the rear of the ink channels. The piezoelectric actuator provides the oscillating ink pressure required for the ink jet operation.

21. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

It would be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that numerous variations and or modifications may be made to the present invention as shown in the preferred embodiment without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as broadly described. The present embodiment is therefore to be considered in all respects to be illustrative and not restrictive.

The presently disclosed ink jet printing technology is potentially suited to a wide range of printing systems including colour and monochrome office printers short run digital printers high speed digital printers offset press supplemental printers low cost scanning printers high speed pagewidth printers notebook computers with inbuilt pagewidth printers portable colour and monochrome printers colour and monochrome copiers colour and monochrome facsimile machines combined printer facsimile and copying machines label printers large format plotters photograph copiers printers for digital photographic minilabs video printers PhotoCD printers portable printers for PDAs wallpaper printers indoor sign printers billboard printers fabric printers camera printers and fault tolerant commercial printer arrays.

The embodiments of the invention use an ink jet printer type device. Of course many different devices could be used. However presently popular ink jet printing technologies are unlikely to be suitable.

The most significant problem with thermal inkjet is power consumption. This is approximately 100 times that required for high speed and stems from the energy inefficient means of drop ejection. This involves the rapid boiling of water to produce a vapor bubble which expels the ink. Water has a very high heat capacity and must be superheated in thermal inkjet applications. This leads to an efficiency of around 0.02 from electricity input to drop momentum and increased surface area out.

The most significant problem with piezoelectric ink jet is size and cost. Piezoelectric crystals have a very small deflection at reasonable drive voltages and therefore require a large area for each nozzle. Also each piezoelectric actuator must be connected to its drive circuit on a separate substrate. This is not a significant problem at the current limit of around 300 nozzles per printhead but is a major impediment to the fabrication of pagewidth printheads with 19 200 nozzles.

Ideally the ink jet technologies used meet the stringent requirements of in camera digital color printing and other high quality high speed low cost printing applications. To meet the requirements of digital photography new ink jet technologies have been created. The target features include 

All of these features can be met or exceeded by the ink jet systems described below with differing levels of difficulty. Forty five different inkjet technologies have been developed by the Assignee to give a wide range of choices for high volume manufacture. These technologies form part of separate applications assigned to the present Assignee as set out in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.

The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems from battery powered one time use digital cameras through to desktop and network printers and through to commercial printing systems.

For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment the printhead is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For color photographic applications the printhead is 100 mm long with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest printhead designed is IJ38 which is 0.35 mm wide giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The printheads each contain 19 200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.

Ink is supplied to the back of the printhead by injection molded plastic ink channels. The molding requires 50 micron features which can be created using a lithographically micromachined insert in a standard injection molding tool. Ink flows through holes etched through the wafer to the nozzle chambers fabricated on the front surface of the wafer. The printhead is connected to the camera circuitry by tape automated bonding.

Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.

The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45 above which matches the docket numbers in the table under the heading Cross References to Related Applications.

Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these forty five examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet printheads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.

Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases a print technology may be listed more than once in a table where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.

Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include Home printers Office network printers Short run digital printers Commercial print systems Fabric printers Pocket printers Internet WWW printers Video printers Medical imaging Wide format printers Notebook PC printers Fax machines Industrial printing systems Photocopiers Photographic minilabs etc.

The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.
