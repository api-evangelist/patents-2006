Advances in technology have resulted in smaller and more powerful personal computing devices. For example there currently exist a variety of portable personal computing devices including wireless computing devices such as portable wireless telephones personal digital assistants PDAs and paging devices that are each small lightweight and can be easily carried by users. More specifically the portable wireless telephones for example further include cellular telephones that communicate voice and data packets over wireless networks. Further many such cellular telephones are being manufactured with relatively large increases in computing capabilities and as such are becoming tantamount to small personal computers and hand held PDAs. However these smaller and more powerful personal computing devices are typically severely resource constrained. For example the screen size amount of available memory and file system space amount of input and output capabilities and processing capability may each be limited by the small size of the device. Because of such severe resource constraints it is often typically desirable for example to maintain a limited size and quantity of software applications and other information residing on such remote personal computing devices e.g. client devices.

Wireless devices e.g. wireless telephones and other portable wireless handheld electronic devices are able to download and execute varying types of executable content e.g. application software etc. In some instances users of the wireless devices wish to transfer content to from a processing device e.g. a personal computer or other processor or logic based device.

Some of the personal computing devices utilize application programming interfaces APIs sometimes referred to as runtime environments and software platforms that are installed onto their local computer platform and which are used for example to simplify operations of such devices such as by providing generalized calls for device specific resources. Further some such APIs are also known to provide software developers the ability to create software applications that are fully executable on such devices. In addition some of such APIs are known to be operationally located between the computing device system software and the software applications such that the computing device computing functionality is made available to the software applications without requiring the software developer to have the specific computing device system source code. Further some APIs are known to provide mechanisms for secure communications between such personal devices i.e. clients and remote devices i.e. servers using secure cryptographic information.

Examples of such APIs some of which are discussed in more detail below include versions of the Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW developed by Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego Calif. BREW is sometimes described as a thin veneer existing over a computing device s typically a wireless cellular phone operating system which among other features provides interfaces to hardware features particularly found on personal computing devices. BREW is further characterized by at least the one advantage of being able to be provided on such personal computing devices at a relatively low cost with respect to demands on such device resources and with respect to the price paid by consumers for devices containing the BREW API. Other features known to be associated with BREW include its end to end software distribution platform that provides a variety of benefits for wireless service operators software developers and computing device consumers. At least one such currently available end to end software distribution platform includes logic distributed over a server client architecture where the server performs for example billing security and application distribution functionality and the client performs for example application execution security and user interface functionality.

One or more aspects are used in conjunction with a runtime environment or application programming interface API executing on the computing device. One such runtime environment or API is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW software previously discussed. However one or more of the described aspects can be used with other types of runtime environments APIs that for example operate to control the execution of applications on wireless client computing devices.

The application download server is shown here on a network with other computer elements in communication with the wireless network . There can be a stand alone server and each server can provide separate services and processes to the client devices across the wireless network . System may also include at least one stored application database e.g. data store that holds the software applications e.g. a D L server application and a D L client application that are downloadable by the server the D L server application is indicated as being downloadable to the server by a dashed line and the D L client application is indicated as being downloadable to the client device by a dashed line . However those skilled in the art will appreciate that the configuration illustrated in is merely exemplary. Accordingly other aspects can include one of more servers that can each perform all the described functions and contain all necessary hardware and software or can contain only selected functionality.

In a block diagram is shown that more fully illustrates system including the components of the wireless network and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary aspects. System is exemplary and can include any system whereby remote client devices such as wireless client computing devices communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components connected via a wireless network including without limitation wireless network carriers and or servers. The application download server and the stored application database communicate with a carrier network through a data link such as the Internet a secure LAN WAN or other network. Stored application database includes a D L client application according to the above described aspects for download to each of the wireless client computer devices . Wireless client computer devices download a copy of D L client application dashed line from stored applications database . In the aspect shown a server can include the application download server distribution server and the stored application database . However these servers can also be independent devices.

Still referring to the aspect of carrier network controls messages generally being data packets sent to a messaging service controller MSC . Carrier network communicates with the MSC through another communications link such as another network the Internet and or POTS plain ordinary telephone system . Typically the network or Internet connection between carrier network and MSC transfers data and the POTS transfers voice information. MSC may be connected to multiple base stations BTS such as by at least one communications link including both a data network and or the Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. BTS ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless communications devices such as cellular telephones in an over the air protocol such as short messaging service SMS etc.

In the aspect of each wireless device such as cellular telephones may include a computer platform that can receive and execute software applications and display data transmitted from computer system or other network servers . Computer platform may include an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other chipset processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. ASIC may be installed at the time of manufacture of cellular telephone . ASIC or other processor may execute an application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs e.g. D L client application in a memory of the wireless device. API is a runtime environment executing on the computing device or cellular telephone in this case. One such runtime environment is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW software although other runtime environments may be utilized that for example operate to control the execution of applications on wireless computing devices. Memory for example can be comprised of at least one of read only and random access memory RAM and ROM EPROM EEPROM flash cards and any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform may also include a local database that can hold the software applications e.g. D L client application files or data not actively used in memory . Local database may include at least one of flash memory cells magnetic media EPROM EEPROM optical media tape a soft disk a hard disk and any other type of secondary or tertiary memory. Thus in the aspect of each cellular telephone may be loaded with applications such as D L client application and or data from computer system in accordance with system .
