The present invention relates generally to gaming machines and methods for playing wagering games and more particularly to a gaming machine having a push button with an integrated or an adjacent movable outcome indicator.

Gaming machines such as slot machines video poker machines and the like have been a cornerstone of the gaming industry for several years. Generally the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the likelihood or perceived likelihood of winning money at the machine and the intrinsic entertainment value of the machine relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing machines and the expectation of winning at each machine is roughly the same or believed to be the same players are likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting machines. Shrewd operators consequently strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting machines features and enhancements available because such machines attract frequent play and hence increase profitability to the operator. Therefore there is a continuing need for gaming machine manufacturers to continuously develop new games and improved gaming enhancements that will attract frequent play through enhanced entertainment value to the player.

Players of gaming machines have been presented with a variety of interface methods for entering commands into the gaming machine. Typical interface components are buttons touch screen panels and the traditional lever. Modern gaming machines are moving away from the lever and focusing more on touch screen and button technologies. The convenience of these offerings helps speed up the play of the games and causes much less exertion to the player.

Buttons on gaming machines have evolved over the years most notably changing in shape and lighting. While many varieties lighting types and purposes exist today the focus of the buttons has always been primarily to initiate commands. While the advent of the button panel has increased the rate of play and made it easier for the player to conduct the game the buttons themselves have generally only provided input to the gaming machine from the player and have had very little to do with information feedback.

To increase the entertainment value of a game and create additional development and theme possibilities variations on the button panel and to the buttons themselves would offer the gaming machine manufacturer additional latitude to help support unique themes and provide a variety of feedback to the player via unique interactive features.

According to one aspect of the present invention a push button assembly for a gaming terminal implementing a wagering game is provided. The push button assembly has a push button actuated by a touch from a player of the wagering game. An outcome indicator indicates a randomly selected outcome in response to the push button being actuated.

According to another aspect of the present invention a push button assembly for a gaming terminal implementing a wagering game is provided. The push button assembly has a push button actuated by a touch from a player of the wagering game. The push button assembly also has a 3 dimensional object related to the wagering game.

According to another aspect of the invention a method of utilizing a push button assembly for a gaming terminal implementing a wagering game is provided. A player input is received via a push button of the push button assembly. An outcome associated with the player input is indicated on an outcome indicator adjacent to or within the push button.

According to an additional aspect of the invention a gaming machine is provided for playing a wagering game. A push button assembly has a push button and an outcome indicator. A controller is coupled to the push button assembly and is programmed to randomly select an outcome from a plurality of outcomes in response to the push button being actuated by a player of the wagering game.

Additional aspects of the invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the detailed description of various embodiments which is made with reference to the drawings a brief description of which is provided below.

While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to the embodiments illustrated.

Referring to a gaming machine is used in gaming establishments such as casinos. With regard to the present invention the gaming machine may be any type of gaming machine and may have varying structures and methods of operation. For example the gaming machine may be an electromechanical gaming machine configured to play mechanical slots or it may be an electronic gaming machine configured to play a video casino game such as blackjack slots keno poker roulette etc.

The gaming machine comprises a housing and includes input devices including a value input device and a player input device . For output the gaming machine includes a primary display for displaying information about the basic wagering game. The primary display can also display information about a bonus wagering game and a progressive wagering game. The gaming machine may also include a secondary display for displaying game events game outcomes and or signage information. While these typical components found in the gaming machine are described below it should be understood that numerous other elements may exist and may be used in any number of combinations to create various forms of a gaming machine .

The value input device may be provided in many forms individually or in combination and is preferably located on the front of the housing . The value input device receives currency and or credits that are inserted by a player. The value input device may include a coin acceptor for receiving coin currency see . Alternatively or in addition the value input device may include a bill acceptor for receiving paper currency. Furthermore the value input device may include a ticket reader or barcode scanner for reading information stored on a credit ticket a card or other tangible portable credit storage device. The credit ticket or card may also authorize access to a central account which can transfer money to the gaming machine .

The player input device comprises a plurality of push buttons on a button panel for operating the gaming machine . In addition or alternatively the player input device may comprise a touch screen mounted by adhesive tape or the like over the primary display and or secondary display . The touch screen contains soft touch keys denoted by graphics on the underlying primary display and used to operate the gaming machine . The touch screen provides players with an alternative method of input. A player enables a desired function either by touching the touch screen at an appropriate touch key or by pressing an appropriate push button on the button panel. The touch keys may be used to implement the same functions as push buttons . Alternatively the push buttons may provide inputs for one aspect of the operating the game while the touch keys may allow for input needed for another aspect of the game.

The various components of the gaming machine may be connected directly to or contained within the housing as seen in or may be located outboard of the housing and connected to the housing via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods. Thus the gaming machine comprises these components whether housed in the housing or outboard of the housing and connected remotely.

The operation of the basic wagering game is displayed to the player on the primary display . The primary display can also display the bonus game associated with the basic wagering game. The primary display may take the form of a cathode ray tube CRT a high resolution LCD a plasma display an LED or any other type of display suitable for use in the gaming machine . As shown the primary display includes the touch screen overlaying the entire monitor or a portion thereof to allow players to make game related selections. Alternatively the primary display of the gaming machine may include a number of mechanical reels to display the outcome in visual associated to at least one payline . In the illustrated embodiment the gaming machine is an upright version in which the primary display is oriented vertically relative to the player. Alternatively the gaming machine may be a slant top version in which the primary display is slanted at about a thirty degree angle toward the player of the gaming machine .

A player begins play of the basic wagering game by making a wager via the value input device of the gaming machine . A player can select play by using the player input device via the buttons or the touch screen keys . The basic game consists of a plurality of symbols arranged in an array and includes at least one payline that indicates one or more outcomes of the basic game. Such outcomes are randomly selected in response to the wagering input by the player. At least one of the plurality of randomly selected outcomes may be a start bonus outcome which can include any variations of symbols or symbol combinations triggering a bonus game.

In some embodiments the gaming machine may also include a player information reader that allows for identification of a player by reading a card with information indicating his or her true identity. The player information reader is shown in as a card reader but may take on many forms including a ticket reader bar code scanner RFID transceiver or computer readable storage medium interface. Currently identification is generally used by casinos for rewarding certain players with complimentary services or special offers. For example a player may be enrolled in the gaming establishment s loyalty club and may be awarded certain complimentary services as that player collects points in his or her player tracking account. The player inserts his or her card into the player information reader which allows the casino s computers to register that player s wagering at the gaming machine . The gaming machine may use the secondary display or other dedicated player tracking display for providing the player with information about his or her account or other player specific information. Also in some embodiments the information reader may be used to restore game assets that the player achieved and saved during a previous game session.

Turning now to the various components of the gaming machine are controlled by a central processing unit CPU also referred to herein as a controller or processor such as a microcontroller or microprocessor . To provide gaming functions the controller executes one or more game programs stored in a computer readable storage medium in the form of memory . The controller performs the random selection using a random number generator RNG of an outcome from the plurality of possible outcomes of the wagering game. Alternatively the random event may be determined at a remote controller. The remote controller may use either an RNG or pooling scheme for its central determination of a game outcome. It should be appreciated that the controller may include one or more microprocessors including but not limited to a master processor a slave processor and a secondary or parallel processor.

The controller is also coupled to the system memory and a money credit detector . The system memory may comprise a volatile memory e.g. a random access memory RAM and a non volatile memory e.g. an EEPROM . The system memory may include multiple RAM and multiple program memories. The money credit detector signals the processor that money and or credits have been input via the value input device . Preferably these components are located within the housing of the gaming machine . However as explained above these components may be located outboard of the housing and connected to the remainder of the components of the gaming machine via a variety of different wired or wireless connection methods.

As seen in the controller is also connected to and controls the primary display the player input device and a payoff mechanism . The payoff mechanism is operable in response to instructions from the controller to award a payoff to the player in response to certain winning outcomes that might occur in the basic game or the bonus game s . The payoff may be provided in the form of points bills tickets coupons cards etc. For example in the payoff mechanism includes both a ticket printer and a coin outlet . However any of a variety of payoff mechanisms well known in the art may be implemented including cards coins tickets smartcards cash etc. The payoff amounts distributed by the payoff mechanism are determined by one or more pay tables stored in the system memory .

Communications between the controller and both the peripheral components of the gaming machine and external systems occur through input output I O circuits . More specifically the controller controls and receives inputs from the peripheral components of the gaming machine through the input output circuits . Further the controller communicates with the external systems via the I O circuits and a communication path e.g. serial parallel IR RC 10bT etc. . The external systems may include a gaming network other gaming machines a gaming server communications hardware or a variety of other interfaced systems or components. Although the I O circuits may be shown as a single block it should be appreciated that each of the I O circuits may include a number of different types of I O circuits.

Controller as used herein comprises any combination of hardware software and or firmware that may be disposed or resident inside and or outside of the gaming machine that may communicate with and or control the transfer of data between the gaming machine and a bus another computer processor or device and or a service and or a network. The controller may comprise one or more controllers or processors. In the controller in the gaming machine is depicted as comprising a CPU but the controller may alternatively comprise a CPU in combination with other components such as the I O circuits and the system memory .

Embodiments of the invention provide a push button assembly having a push button and an integrated or adjacent outcome indicator. The push button assembly is housed within a gaming terminal that implements a wagering game. The outcome indicator indicates an outcome such as e.g. a bonus a payout or a symbol which when applied to other outcomes of the wagering game can sometimes result in a bonus or a payout. The push button assembly may be located on the button panel or adjacent to the primary display . The outcome indicator may be a 3 dimensional object such as a mechanical reel on which various symbols are located.

The outcome indicator is activated by the player depressing the push button of the push button assembly. After the player has activated the outcome indicator an outcome is randomly selected and is indicated by the outcome indicator. In an embodiment in which the basic wagering game is a slot game the outcome indicator is activated separate from the main reels in the wagering game. For example the player presses a Spin Reels button or pulls a lever to begin the spinning of the reels in the wagering game. The outcome indicator may be activated after the reels in the wagering game have begun spinning or after at least one of the reels has stopped spinning in some embodiments. In other embodiments the outcome indicator is activated before the reels in the wagering game have begun spinning. The controller selects an outcome to be displayed on the outcome indicator.

There are several ways in which the outcome indicator is implemented as indicated by . In each of these ways the player typically must physically touch the push button of the push button assembly to activate the outcome indicator. By requiring the player to physically touch the push button the player perceives that he she has some control over the outcome.

The miniature reel may include lighting elements such as multi colored LEDs to illuminate the interior of the push button assembly . Although the push button assembly is described as having a miniature reel any suitable type of interchangeable 3 dimensional object may be contained within the push button assembly to indicate the symbol outcome that has been selected. Alternatively a video image of a 3 dimensional object may be displayed under the push button cap of the push button assembly e.g. on an LCD display.

As discussed above the player may initially make a wager spin the main reels on the main displayed as shown in and then depress the push button cap to activate the spinning of the miniature reel . In other embodiments the player is given the opportunity to utilize the push button assembly when a bonus has been achieved in the basic game.

In the event that the miniature reel shows only the standard symbols normally shown on the main reels e.g. cherry or 1 bar symbols etc. the miniature reel provides the player with an opportunity to achieve an enhanced outcome e.g. a combination of four cherry symbols even when only three main reels are utilized.

The miniature reel may also be linked to a skill stop function such that the player perceives that he she is stopping the miniature reel by a second depressing of the push button cap when as discussed above the miniature reel is actually stopped randomly. Thus after the initial depressing of the push button cap the player presses the push button cap a second time in an attempt to stop the reel .

In a further alternative a miniature video display may be placed alongside the miniature reel or if the video display is transmissive using a transmissive LCD or a flexible LED display the video display could be placed on the transparent button cap over the miniature reel such that an image could be superimposed over the miniature reel .

In additional embodiments the outcome indicator does not utilize a mechanical reel or a video reel. Instead it may utilize other 3 dimensional objects or a video rendering of 3 dimensional objects such as those described below with respect to . The various embodiments of the push button assembly are utilized to present different themes for the push button assembly for wagering games such as blackjack slots keno poker roulette etc.

In some embodiments the assembly includes a touch sensitive surface located on the cap or if the assembly incorporates a video display for rendering 3 dimensional objects on the video display. The player may touch the touch sensitive surface to provide the feeling as though the outcome is being controlled by the player.

As illustrated the touch sensitive surface shown in includes several intersecting sensors wires that sense a touch from the player. As shown the sensors wires may form a grid across the touch sensitive surface . The player may select one of the keno numbers by touching an area of the touch sensitive surface corresponding to the number positioned below the cap . Other touch sensitive surfaces can be used as well. Although visible in the sensors wires are typically transparent so as to not interfere with game play.

A touch sensitive surface may also be utilized in an alternative embodiment where the outcome indicator is a miniature reel as shown in . The miniature reel may be actuated by the player swiping the touch sensitive surface of the cap with a finger to provide the feeling on controlling the speed of miniature reel. That is the speed at which the player swipes the finger appears to alter the speed of the miniature reel even though the outcome of a spin of the miniature reel is a random event. In some embodiments an additional wager is required before the player has the opportunity to activate the miniature reel.

Instead of displaying dice below tie button cap other embodiments may utilize physical dice that are in a fixed position and are encased or suspended in a clear acrylic or other clear material. The dice may also be embedded or connected to a base and covered by the clear button cap comprised of acrylic or other clear material. The dice may be embedded in the base with a surface around the dice being opaque. The dice may be transparent and of a variety of colors depending on the theme and other requirements of the game. Light emitting diodes LEDs could be positioned around the outer edge of the button under the surface. The LEDs illuminate the area beneath the surface and light passes through the translucent dice as initiated by the game. This provides a glow to the dice when the LEDs are lit. LEDs are positioned to represent the spots on a regular six sided die and can produce all of the possible outcomes of a typical dice combination and depending on the requirements of the game non standard combinations. Upon depressing the button cap a random combination of recognizable numeric values are displayed on the dice. The push button assembly can be used to realize a value for an award or may be used to initiate movement such as on a gaming board on the primary display or secondary display . When the button cap is depressed it activates a switch or actuator that initiates a random number generator on the controller of the gaming machine that randomly determines a number between one and twelve or other values depending on the type of dice and the possible numeric values . The result is transmitted back to the push button assembly and is displayed by illuminating the appropriate LEDs on the dice. While this example is with respect to a typical dice pair it should be recognized by those with ordinary skill in the art that any numeric value displayed on any type of dice that can support a numeric value is also viable. Further information concerning a push button assembly incorporating dice may be obtained from U.S. application Ser. No. 11 052 590 entitled Gaming Machine With Button Panel Features filed Feb. 7 2005 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Although only is described as having a touch sensitive surface on its button cap could also utilize touch sensitive surfaces in implementing the outcome indicator.

In addition to e.g. a mechanical reel the push button assemblies described above may also house another 3 dimensional object such as a diorama. A diorama may be a 3 dimensional miniature scene having objects arranged in a naturalistic setting against a painted background. As an example one can consider the roulette wheel described above with respect to to be a diorama.

Other embodiments of the invention display an outcome indicator having or displaying e.g. a pointer or a pendulum for indicating the outcome. The pointer may be a physical object such as an arrow that points to an outcome selected for the player. Alternatively the pointer may be a video representation of an object such as the arrow that points to the selected outcome. The pendulum may be a physical pendulum that moves back and forth across a set of possible outcomes and stops on the selected outcome. Alternatively the pendulum may be a video representation of a pendulum.

A further alternative embodiment includes a transmissive LCD display. The transmissive LCD display may be utilized when a 3 dimensional object such as a mechanical reel is utilized and is housed below the button cap. In such embodiments the transmissive LCD display may display images symbols that interact with the 3 dimensional object to provide enhanced images. For example the transmissive LCD display can create an illusion of different colors such that e.g. a 3 dimensional object below the button cap appears to change colors. Further information concerning the use of a transmissive LCD over a mechanical object may be obtained from U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004 0198485 entitled Gaming Machine With Superimposed Display Image filed Nov. 7 2003 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments the outcome indicator e.g. or of respectively displays game enhancement parameters. For example if the outcome indicator is a mechanical reel after the mechanical reel or has begun spinning and then stops spinning a game enhancement parameter displayed in the center of the visible portion of the miniature reel or is implemented if applicable. A game enhancement parameter provides a player with additional excitement during play. Different types of game enhancement parameters provide the player with the opportunity to achieve a higher payout or make it easier for the player to achieve a payout or other award.

The various game enhancement parameters may include for example 2 5 10 MAGIC MAYHEM MAGIC NUDGE PRESTO PAY 5 PAY 10 PAY 25 UPGRADE DIFFERENT PAY TABLE EXTRA WILD SCATTER RIGHT TO LEFT RE SPIN MORPH INCREASED WAGER HOLD SYMBOL and SYMBOL MOVEMENT as described below. In some embodiments the game enhancement parameter can only award an enhanced payout if the player has achieved a winning combination in the main game. In all of the alternatives discussed below it is assumed that the game enhancement parameter is indicated via the outcome indicator of the push button assembly.

2 5 and 10 The 2 5 and 10 game enhancement parameters are multiplier game enhancement parameters that multiply a payout or other outcome awarded to the player based on the outcome on the main reels of a slot wagering game. In the event that e.g. the 2 symbol is indicated by the outcome indicator a payout awarded for a winning combination on the three main reels will be multiplied by a factor of 2. However if the player does not achieve a winning combination on the three main reels the player will not be awarded a double payout because there is no payout to double.

Similarly if the 5 or 10 game enhancement parameters are indicated by the outcome indicator a payout earned based on a winning combination on the three main reels would be multiplied by factors of 5 and 10 respectively. Although only 2 5 and 10 multiplier game enhancement parameters are discussed above it should be appreciated that any suitable multiplier game enhancement parameter could be utilized such as e.g. 15 or 25 .

MAGIC MAYHEM When the MAGIC MAYHEM game enhancement parameter is indicated by the outcome indicator and the player has achieved a winning combination on the main reels the main reels are re spun to the same winning combination a predetermined number of times resulting in enhanced payouts. For example in the even that a winning combination of three cherry symbols on an active payline of the main reels is achieved when the MAGIC MAYHEM game enhancement parameter is indicated the main reels are re spun to the three cherry symbols combination at least once. Accordingly if the MAGIC MAYHEM re spins the main reels 3 times the player will be awarded an enhanced payout that is 4 times the size of the payout normally awarded for the symbol combination on the main reels i.e. the value of the payout for the winning combination based on the initial spin and the value of the 3 payouts achieved on the 3 re spins .

MAGIC NUDGE The MAGIC NUDGE game enhancement parameter is advantageous in situations where a better payout can be achieved by moving symbols on one or multiple reels either up or down across a payline. This game enhancement parameter automatically nudges the reels to the better symbol combination to achieve a higher payout. For example in the event that three main reels display a combination of 3 bars 3 bars and 1 bar symbols on an active payline and a 3 bars symbol is located directly above the 1 bar symbol on the third reel the symbols on the third reel would be nudged downward so that three 3 bars symbols are displayed on the payline resulting in a higher payout.

PRESTO When a winning combination appears on the three main reels the PRESTO game enhancement parameter re spins the three main reels to a better winning combination. In some embodiments the reels are re spun to the next best winning combination according to a pre determined pay table e.g. from a winning combination that pays out 1 credit to a winning combination that pays out 2 credits . In other embodiments the reels are re spun to any better winning combination e.g. from a winning combination that pays out 1 credit to a winning combination that pays out 8 credits . In some embodiments the player forfeits a payout based on the initial winning combination and instead receives only the higher payout.

PAY 5 PAY 10 and PAY 20 When a winning combination appears on the three main reels and the outcome indicator indicates the PAY 5 PAY 10 or the PAY 20 game enhancement parameter 5 10 or 20 extra credits are added to the player s payout. In other embodiments a winning combination is not required to receive the extra payout.

UPGRADE The UPGRADE game enhancement parameter causes a winning symbol combination to move up at least one or two winning symbol combinations on the pay table for the gaming machine . For example a lower paying combination of three cherry symbols may pay out as if the player had achieved three 3 bars symbols a better combination.

DIFFERENT PAY TABLE The DIFFERENT PAY TABLE game enhancement parameter implements a different and higher paying pay table awarding larger payouts for various symbol combinations. For example if a combination of three cherry symbols normally pays out 2 credits for each credit wagered the DIFFERENT PAY TABLE game enhancement parameter may result in a payout of 3 credits for each credit wagered for the combination. Thus if the outcome indicator indicates the DIFFERENT PAY TABLE symbol a new pay table can be illustrated to the player.

EXTRA WILD The EXTRA WILD game enhancement parameter causes a symbol that is normally a regular symbol such as a cherry symbol or a 1 bar symbol to become a wild symbol. For example in the event that a the player achieves a combination of consecutive 3 bars 3 bars and 1 bar symbols and b and the EXTRA WILD game enhancement parameter causes all 1 bar symbols to become wild symbols then c the wild 1 bar symbol would represent a 3 bars symbol and the player would be awarded a payout for achieving a combination of three 3 bars symbols. This combination would provide a larger payout than the initial combination.

SCATTER The SCATTER game enhancement parameter converts a single line pay into a scatter payout such that a winning combination of symbols need not be located all on a single active payline. As such the best possible symbol combination on the display results in the award to the player.

RIGHT TO LEFT Many slot games require that winning combinations be comprised of symbols on consecutive reels and must start with the left most reel i.e. these slot games require a left to right combination of symbols . The RIGHT TO LEFT game enhancement parameter allows right to left combinations i.e. combinations starting on the right most reel and extending left across the reels to win in addition to the standard winning left to right combinations. This game enhancement parameter is particularly applicable to a slot game having five or more reels. For example if the five symbols on the payline from the left most reel are cherry 1 bar 1 bar 1 bar and 1 bar the player would not have achieved a winning combination of a machine paying left to right only. However if the RIGHT TO LEFT game enhancement parameter were implemented then the player would have a winning combination of symbols i.e. the four 1 bar symbols from the right side .

MORPH The MORPH game enhancement parameter allows one or more symbols on the reels to morph into other symbols that are more beneficial. For example if the player gets a combination of two cherry symbols and a 1 bar symbol and a the two cherry symbols combination provides a certain winning payout and b a combination of three cherry symbols would result in a higher winning payout then the 1 bar symbol morphs into a cherry symbol resulting in the higher paying winning combination.

INCREASED WAGER A winning combination typically results in a payout that is generally proportionate to the amount wagered. For example when five credits are wagered and the player achieves a winning combination the payout is at least five times as large as it would have been if only one credit had been wagered. The INCREASED WAGER game enhancement parameter treats a winning combination as though the player had bet the maximum amount thereby effectively increasing the wagered amount resulting in a higher payout. For example of the player had only wagered 1 of 5 possible credits the INCREASED WAGER game enhancement parameter would treat the player s wager as though 5 credits had been wagered.

HOLD SYMBOL The HOLD SYMBOL game enhancement parameter holds a symbol in a certain location on one of the reels so that a final symbol combination across the reels must take into account the held symbol. For example in the event that a 1 bar symbol is one of the more valuable symbols available a reel displaying this symbol may be held i.e. not spun while the remainder of the reels spin. The symbol on the reel that is held may be selected by the player from a list of different hidden symbols or may be randomly assigned to the player. Accordingly when the other reels are spun the player has a greater chance of receiving a high payout e.g. by a winning combination including the valuable held symbol .

SYMBOL MOVEMENT The SYMBOL MOVEMENT game enhancement parameter allows symbols to move to other locations along a payline if it would result in a better outcome e.g. a higher payout . For example symbols can move up or down on the same reel or they can move across reels if such movement results in a better combination for the player.

The game enhancement parameters discussed above are merely examples and it should be appreciated that this list is not exhaustive. In practice additional types of game enhancement parameters may be indicated to the player. Although the game enhancement parameters are described above primarily with respect to slot wagering games some of these game enhancement parameters are also applicable to other wagering games such as keno blackjack poker roulette etc. Not all game enhancement parameters provide winning outcomes in the event that the player fails to achieve a winning outcome in the basic game.

Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention which is set forth in the following claims.
