title: Automated validation of results of human performance of tasks
abstract: Techniques are described for facilitating automated validation of results of performance of tasks. In some situations, task requesters may specify various automated validation criteria for tasks that they submit, and those specified validation criteria may automatically be used to determine whether results of performance of those tasks by task performers are validated. To facilitate such automated validation, predefined types of validation criteria may be provided that a user may select and/or configure. The outcome of automated validation of results may be used in various ways, such as to indicate when results have been validated and/or have not been validated, to determine whether to provide results to a task requester (e.g., if results are not provided unless they have been validated, or if results that fail validation are corrected or replaced with results that pass validation) and/or to compensate task performers for providing the results.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 990 949 filed on Nov. 16 2004 and entitled Providing an Electronic Marketplace to Facilitate Human Performance of Programmatically Submitted Tasks now U.S. Pat. No. 7 945 469 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The following disclosure relates generally to facilitating automated validation of results of task performance such as to enable task requesters who submit tasks to be performed by other human task performer users to specify how automatic validation of the results of the performance will occur.

The Internet comprises a vast number of computers and computer networks that are interconnected through communication links with information being exchanged using various services such as electronic mail and the World Wide Web also referred to as the Web . In addition to providing access to information the Web has increasingly become a medium that is used to search for shop for and order items such as products services and or information that are for purchase rent lease license trade evaluation sampling subscription to etc. In many circumstances a user can visit the Web site of a Web merchant or a Web store or otherwise interact with an online retailer or electronic marketplace that provides one or more items such as to view information about the items give an instruction to place an order for one or more items and provide information needed to complete the purchase e.g. payment and shipping information . The Web merchant then fulfills the order by providing the ordered items to the indicated recipient such as by providing product items that have been ordered through physical distribution channels e.g. shipment via a governmental postal service or private common carrier or electronically e.g. via download over the Internet such as for digital music or videos as appropriate. Ordered service items may similarly be provided electronically e.g. providing email service or physically e.g. performing cleaning services at the purchaser s house .

In addition to such Web based interactions between computers e.g. interactions initiated by users using Web browser applications to interactively request Web pages from Web servers various distributed computing systems are known in which multiple computer systems interact in other manners in order to achieve a goal. For example it is often desirable for an application program on a computer system to interact with remote systems and applications in order to obtain various types of information and functionality that are not part of the application program. By performing such interactions an application program may be able to leverage information and functionality from vast numbers of other computer systems over the Internet or other networks. In order to enable such interactions between remote computer systems and application programs various programmatic interaction mechanisms have been developed. For example remote procedure call RPC protocols have long existed that allow a program on one computer to cause a program on another computer to be executed and various object oriented and other architectures such as CORBA Common Object Request Broker Architecture Java RMI Remote Method Invocation JavaSpaces Jini JXTA UPnP Universal Plug and Play and DCOM Distributed Component Object Model provide similar capabilities. In addition a variety of middleware programs have been implemented to connect separate applications often of distinct types and from unrelated sources to allow communication. For example various EDI Electronic Data Interchange networks exist that provide standard mechanisms to allow a computer system of one user of the network to send data to a computer system of another user of the network.

The widespread popularity of the Web has also provided additional opportunities for computers to inter communicate in various programmatic manners. For example there is growing use of the Web to provide so called Web services which typically involve the programmatic interaction of remote applications to exchange information via defined APIs application program interfaces or the like. Web services may allow heterogeneous applications and computers to interact and can be defined and implemented using a variety of underlying protocols and techniques. For example some Web service implementations return data in XML eXtensible Markup Language format using HTTP HyperText Transport Protocol in response to a Web service invocation request specified as a URI Uniform Resource Identifier such as a URL Uniform Resource Locator that includes a specified operation and one or more query parameters. In other implementations additional underlying protocols are used for various purposes such as SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol for standard message exchange WSDL Web Services Description Language for description of service invocations and UDDI Universal Description Discovery and Integration service for discovery of available services.

Unfortunately while Web services and other programmatic interaction mechanisms allow various application programs and computers to interact such interactions are typically limited in various ways. For example the types of information and functionality that are available to be requested using such programmatic interactions are typically restricted to very limited types of requests that the remote computer systems and applications can automatically fulfill e.g. to provide a specified predefined group of information such as a Web page or file or to perform a specified database query on a specified database . Moreover there is a very large class of tasks which computers and application programs cannot easily automatically perform but which humans can typically easily perform referred to herein as human performance tasks. This is due at least in part to various cognitive and other mental capabilities of humans that are not easily encoded in automated programs such as the ability to use human judgment to form opinions to perform abstract or common sense reasoning to perform various discernment and perception tasks e.g. visual and aural pattern recognition such as based on experience to use cultural awareness and emotional intelligence and to perform various other everyday yet highly complex kinds of perception cognition reasoning and thinking.

However existing settings that allow parties to make tasks available for performance by human users also have various problems. One example of a problem that arises in the context of human performance of tasks is that of efficiently and effectively determining the quality and other acceptability of the results from the performance of the tasks. In some cases to ensure that results of task performance by others are acceptable the parties that provide the tasks may perform some or all of the provided tasks themselves in order to evaluate the others results which may assist in ensuring quality of results but also typically causes significant amounts of time and energy to be used by the task providing parties. In other cases parties who provide tasks may merely use the results from others without any verification that the results are actually acceptable such as based solely on the task performers qualifications and or prior activities which may cause inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate results to be used.

A software facility is described that facilitates interactions between task requesters who have tasks that are available to be performed and task performers who are available to perform tasks. In at least some embodiments the tasks to be performed are cognitive human performance tasks that use cognitive and other mental skills of human task performers such as to employ judgment perception and or reasoning skills of the human task performers. In addition in at least some embodiments an intermediary electronic marketplace is provided that allows task requester users and task performer users to programmatically and or interactively engage in task related transactions and to perform various other activities related to performance of tasks.

In particular in some embodiments one or more computing systems providing the electronic marketplace act as an intermediary to allow task requesters to programmatically request e.g. via programmatic invocations of one or more APIs of the electronic marketplace by application programs of the task requesters that tasks be performed by human task performers and to receive corresponding results after the tasks are performed e.g. as responses to the programmatic invocations thus providing a form of artificial intelligence to task requesters application programs. Similarly human task performers can access the electronic marketplace e.g. in a programmatic or interactive manner to obtain information about available tasks that they can perform and to provide the results of task performance after the completion of tasks that they are assigned. By enabling large numbers of unaffiliated or otherwise unrelated task requesters and task performers to interact via the intermediary electronic marketplace in this manner free market mechanisms mediated by the Internet or other public computer networks can be used to programmatically harness the collective intelligence of an ensemble of unrelated human task performers.

The electronic marketplace in at least some embodiments further performs a variety of additional activities to facilitate the performance of tasks. For example the electronic marketplace may track the progression of the tasks through various states e.g. an open state for tasks that are available to be performed an assigned state for each assignment of a task to one or more task performers a completed state for an assignment after the task performer provides the results of performance of the task etc. and may further take various actions corresponding to the tasks. In addition in some embodiments task performer users may specify various actions related to tasks such as to request that information about available tasks and or about other users be provided in various ways e.g. to be notified when specified types of tasks become available and if so the electronic marketplace may initiate those actions as appropriate.

In some embodiments a task requester user may impose various criteria regarding performance of a task e.g. required and or preferred qualifications for task performers time limits for task completion etc. and or may specify various actions associated with task performance e.g. payment of a specified fee under specified conditions and if so the electronic marketplace may enforce those criteria and initiate those actions as appropriate for the task. For example in some embodiments task requesters may specify various automated validation criteria for tasks that they submit and those specified validation criteria may then automatically be used to determine whether results of performance of those tasks by task performers are validated. The electronic marketplace may provide support for such automated validation in various ways including by assisting task requesters in specifying appropriate validation criteria e.g. by providing predefined types of validation criteria that a task requester may select and or configure and or by automatically enforcing specified validation criteria for task performance results. When automated validation of results is performed the outcome from the validation may be used in various ways such as to indicate to a task requester who submitted a task when results of performance of the task have been validated and or have not been validated. Furthermore the outcome of validation may be used to determine whether to provide the results of performance of a task to the task requester who submitted the task e.g. if results are not provided unless they have been validated or if results that fail validation are automatically corrected or replaced with results that pass validation and or to compensate task performers for providing the results. Thus the use of such validation criteria to perform automated validation of task performance results provides a mechanism to ensure that the task performance results satisfy a specified quality standard or other appropriateness standard e.g. by being sufficiently accurate acceptable relevant timely and or non offensive such as by exceeding a specified minimum threshold .

Validation criteria may have a variety of forms and be used in a variety of ways in various embodiments. For example in some embodiments validation criteria may include various types of validation tests or other types of validation actions to be performed as part of evaluating task performance results in order to generate a determination of whether the results are valid e.g. by passing the tests or otherwise having the validation actions succeed . As one example validation criteria may include having multiple task performer users independently provide the same results or results that are otherwise sufficiently in agreement such as to validate results if they are obtained from a specified exact or minimum number of task performers or if they are part of a majority or plurality or other specified percentage of a group of multiple results from a specified exact or minimum number of task performers. As another example validation criteria may include having one or more task performers evaluate and confirm initial task results received from one or more other task performers such as if the evaluating task performers are more highly qualified in one or more indicated manners than the task performers who provide the initial results. Furthermore in some embodiments if task results are not validated such as if one or more evaluation task performers do not confirm initial task results received from one or more other initial task performers the electronic marketplace may further take automatic action to correct or replace the initial task results in various ways. For example the initial task performers may be provided an opportunity to correct the initial task results e.g. so that they may receive the fee initially associated with successful performance of the task or instead a reduced fee to reflect the additional costs to the electronic marketplace of providing the correction opportunity and or to provide incentives to initially provide correct results and or to reflect a diminished value placed on results from task performer users known to provide incorrect results . Alternatively one or more other task performers may be provided an opportunity to correct the initial task results such as for some or all of the fee initially associated with successful performance of the task. Such other task performer users may include evaluation task performer users if any that had identified the initial task results as being correct other task performer users that are preferred to the initial task performer users e.g. task performer users with a higher level of qualifications than the initial task performer users etc. . Furthermore other task performer users may include any other task performer users qualified to perform the task such as if the task is again made available via the electronic marketplace to any qualified task performer users or any users other than the initial task performer users whether with the initial incorrect results being provided or not.

Validation criteria may further in some embodiments be used to validate whether results satisfy specified value checks and or type checks such as based on whether results are within a range or other enumerated group of allowable values or based on a data type and or format of the results being correct. For example a data type and or format check may include determining whether the results are in the form of a string e.g. with a number of characters that satisfy predefined criteria or in the form of an integer or other number e.g. with a certain number of digits with a value within an allowed range etc. . In addition a data type and or format check may include verifying that a value matches a predefined pattern such as a phone number e.g. by having a certain number of digits optionally with dashes in predefined locations or parentheses around an area code portion and optionally with some of the digits being limited to certain values an IP address e.g. with a certain number of groups of numbers separated by periods a zip code a social security number etc. Validation criteria may further in at least some embodiments include that results be compared to results of other tasks in one or more ways and for one or more purposes such as to compare current results to previously performed tasks that are of a same type or category or that otherwise have specified task attributes or match other specified criteria and or to compare results of a task that is supplied as part of a group of tasks to the results of other tasks of that group. The results comparison may be performed in various ways including by determining that the results are sufficiently similar using one or more similarity measures e.g. to compare results data type format values etc. and or to not validate results that are automatically identified as being outliers with respect to the other results with respect to one or more similarity or other grouping measures. In some embodiments task requesters may further be able to supply executable code e.g. a script program applet etc. to be used as a validation criterion by executing the code for results and or may be able to specify executable logic or other relationships between other specified validation criteria. Furthermore in some embodiments validation criteria may be specified in manners other than by the task requesters who supply tests such as automatically by the electronic marketplace and or based on instructions or feedback provided by the task performer users. In addition in at least some embodiments validation criteria may have associated conditions under which the validation criteria are to applied such as if the validation criteria are only used to evaluate a subset of task performance results for a type of task or other group of tasks e.g. for the purposes of sampling results . For example a particular group of one or more validation criteria may be specified to be used for the results of only a certain percentage of tasks e.g. 10 such as by tracking prior use of that validation criteria group and only applying it at appropriate times or by considering use of that validation criteria for the results of each task but only using the validation criteria if an appropriate likelihood is satisfied during the consideration e.g. by generating a random number and determining whether the appropriate likelihood is satisfied by the random number such as to achieve a 10 chance by having a 1 in 10 chance likelihood for each time that use of the validation criteria is considered . Additional details regarding such validation criteria are discussed in greater detail below.

In some embodiments the electronic marketplace further provides a variety of types of functionality related to obtaining and using information about qualifications and other attributes of task performer users and or task requester users such as to allow users to identify and or specify types of users with whom to conduct transactions. For example the electronic marketplace may track various information about activities by task performer users and or task requester users in some embodiments such as to automatically generate quantitative measurements of actions taken by the users that may be used as qualifications e.g. activities related to prior task performance . More generally in some embodiments the electronic marketplace may support user qualifications of various types e.g. qualifications for a user that are asserted by that user that are specified by one or more other users and or that are automatically generated by the electronic marketplace . Furthermore in some embodiments the electronic marketplace provides functionality to authenticate or otherwise corroborate information about users e.g. users qualifications identities non qualification attributes etc. such as based on obtained evidence that supports that information and may then use such corroborated information in various ways. In addition in some embodiments information about qualifications and or other attributes of task performer users may further be used to select which validation criteria should be used for evaluating results of performance of a task such as to apply validation criteria for a task only to task performance results from task performers whose qualifications and other attributes fail to reach a minimum threshold or to apply more exacting validation criteria to such task performers than to other task performers whose qualifications and other attributes do reach the minimum threshold. Functionality provided by the electronic marketplace related to qualifications and corroboration of user information is discussed in greater detail below.

Interactions between the electronic marketplace and users of the marketplace can occur in a variety of ways. As previously noted in some embodiments task requesters interact with the electronic marketplace in a programmatic manner such as by invoking defined APIs of the marketplace e.g. APIs based on Web services provided by the electronic marketplace to send messages that request or supply information. The defined APIs may allow the task requesters to not only submit tasks that are available to be performed but also to perform various other actions with respect to previously submitted tasks e.g. check on the status of pending tasks modify information about pending tasks submit instructions regarding handling of pending tasks and interactively obtain results for completed tasks . In addition the defined APIs may allow task requesters to further perform various other types of interactions with the electronic marketplace such as searching for and or browsing for information of interest e.g. to identify available task performers having specified qualifications or attributes or to identify information about tasks submitted by other task requesters supplying qualification information for themselves and or for task performers etc. In addition while in some embodiments all communications between task requesters and task performers occur via the electronic marketplace in other embodiments at least some communications may occur directly between a task requester and a task performer e.g. to allow a task performer to obtain information from a task requester regarding a task to be performed to allow a task performer to provide task results information to a task requester for a task that has been performed etc. or more generally between any two or more users such as after the electronic marketplace facilitates that direct communication e.g. by providing appropriate contact or other communication related information to at least one of the parties to the communication .

In situations in which a final response is not immediately available to a programmatically supplied message e.g. a final response that includes results from performing a task that is submitted with the message the electronic marketplace may in some embodiments provide an immediate response that acknowledges receipt of the message e.g. by providing a unique task identifier for a task being submitted and may later provide one or more additional related electronic communications e.g. to provide the results from performing a task to the task requester who submitted the task . Such additional electronic communications may be performed in a variety of ways such as by initiating a new electronic message e.g. email instant messaging etc. by using a callback mechanism supplied along with the original message etc.

In at least some embodiments the electronic marketplace may also provide an interactive console that allows task requesters to interactively perform some or all of the various types of actions previously noted whether instead of or in addition to a programmatic interface that is provided for those actions. For example in some embodiments the interactive console functionality may be accessed by a task requester user via a Web browser that interacts with a Web server for the electronic marketplace e.g. by supplying appropriate information in a form on a Web page from the electronic marketplace .

In a similar manner task performer users may interact with the electronic marketplace in a variety of ways in order to identify available tasks of interest and to perform such tasks whether in a programmatic and or interactive manner. More generally task performer users may similarly perform a variety of types of actions with respect to the electronic marketplace including searching for and or browsing for available tasks for which they are qualified searching for and or browsing for tasks from task requesters who have specified attributes supplying qualification information requesting assignments for available tasks of interest supplying results from performance of tasks to which they have been assigned requesting notifications of later submitted tasks for which they are qualified providing various types of preference information etc. Additional details regarding specific types of interactions with the electronic marketplace by task requester and task performer users are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

In particular in this example a variety of human task requester users are each interacting with one or more application programs to request that tasks be performed by registering or otherwise submitting the tasks to the TFF system as well as to perform various other interactions with the TFF system. To submit the tasks or perform other interactions the application programs each programmatically invoke one or more Web services WSes that are part of TFF system s API in this example embodiment. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere each of the task requests may include a variety of information about the task to be performed including one or more qualifications needed by any human task performer who performs the tasks one or more other criteria related to task performance e.g. deadlines for completion associated validation criteria for use in validating results of performance of the task and requirements for the format of results from the task performance and one or more associated fees to be provided to the human task performers who successfully perform the task.

Similarly in the illustrated embodiment other task requester users submit available tasks and perform other interactions with the TFF system in an interactive manner via Web browser programs that communicate information supplied by the users to an interactive console with the console then interacting with the API of the TFF system in a manner similar to that of the interactions by the application programs. In the illustrated embodiment the console is provided as part of the TFF system whether on the same or different computing systems used for other parts of the TFF system such as based on one or more Web pages provided by a Web server of the TFF system. In other embodiments however one or more such consoles or other mechanisms to interact with the TFF system may instead by provided externally to the TFF system such as by third parties whether instead of or in addition to any console s provided by the TFF system . After receiving the information for the available tasks being submitted via the API the TFF system stores information about the available tasks for use by task performers. While not illustrated here some task requester users may be part of both group and group by interacting with the TFF system in both programmatic and interactive manners such as at different times and or for different purposes.

Based on the interactions with the human task performers the TFF system tracks information about the current status of tasks such as by updating information about available tasks and stores results from the performance of tasks that are received via interface . After a task is performed and corresponding results are received the TFF system can notify the task requester that supplied that task of the results in a variety of ways. For example in some embodiments the results are provided to task requesters via the interactive console when the task requesters next interact with the console. Alternatively task performance results may instead be electronically sent to the task requesters via the API as a response to a prior invocation or may instead be sent to task requesters in any other way that provides the information to the task requesters in a timely manner e.g. via email telephone fax postal mail etc. . In other embodiments a task requester may be notified of the results after validation criteria associated with a corresponding task have been used to attempt to validate the results such as to notify the task requester of the results only if they are validated and or to provide a notification of the outcome of applying the validation criteria to the results.

In addition the TFF system in the illustrated embodiment facilitates the exchange of payments between parties to transactions involving tasks such as between task requesters and task performers e.g. to provide payments to the task performers from the task requesters for satisfactory performance of submitted tasks . In the illustrated embodiment the TFF system may include internal payment handling capabilities such as via a payment handling system although in other embodiments the TFF system may instead interact with an external payment handling system whether from the same organization that provides the TFF system or instead from a third party to provide the payments. In some situations task performance payments may be made automatically after a task is performed e.g. after automated verification is performed by the TFF system on received task results to ensure that any criteria for the task have been met while in other situations the payments may instead be made only after the task requester has reviewed and accepted the results or failed to reject the results after a specified period of time . In addition as described in greater detail elsewhere a variety of other types of payments may be made in other situations such as payments from task performers payments to or from the TFF system e.g. for services provided by the system and or payments to or from one or more third parties.

Moreover a variety of types of non monetary compensation e.g. for performance of tasks and other non monetary rewards may also be used in other embodiments whether provided by task requesters e.g. for performance of submitted tasks task performers e.g. for the opportunity to perform tasks the TFF system e.g. for specified types of user activities and or third parties to transactions related to task performance. In particular in some embodiments compensation to one or more task performers for performance of one or more tasks may include credit and or discounts for use at one or more online retailers e.g. a Web merchant affiliated with the TFF system such as to allow those task performers to purchase and or rent goods and services for themselves and or for others as gifts. In addition in some embodiments such compensation and or information about such compensation e.g. a promise to provide such compensation at a future time when specified conditions are satisfied may also be provided immediately or substantially immediately to a task performer or other recipient of the compensation such as to allow the recipient to immediately use the compensation for a retail transaction. In other situations a reward for performance of a task may include recognition of the task performer e.g. by display information about specified activities of the task performer and or a ranking of the task performer relative to other task performers such as a task performed for a task requester that is a charity or that otherwise benefits a charitable cause or other beneficial entity or activity.

The module may also provide a variety of types of functionality other than exchanging task and task result information with users. For example the module may receive various types of information about users via the API e.g. evidence of a user s identity qualification information for users payment source and or repository information for a user demographic information user preferences etc. such as when users initially register with the TFF system to act as task performers and or task requesters. In the illustrated embodiment the module then stores the user qualification information in database and the other user information in database although in other embodiments the information may be stored in other ways and may then provide such information to users when appropriate via the API such as in response to search and or browse requests. A variety of other types of information may also be available e.g. information about users accounts with the TFF system aggregate information about groups of related users or all users information about historical activities of specific users and or groups of users summary and overview information about tasks that have been performed etc. and if so the module may similarly provide such information to users when appropriate via the API.

In the illustrated embodiment the TFF system further includes various additional modules that provide additional types of functionality such as to assist the module although in other embodiments some or all of the additional modules and or additional types of functionality may not be included or may be combined together in different manners. As one example the illustrated embodiment of the TFF system includes an Access Control Manager module to assist in controlling access to various functionality and stored information such as based on specific access policies specified by users for specific pieces of information and or based on default policies of the TFF system. In particular after a user s identity and or other relevant information is determined whether by the Access Control Manager module module or other entity such as an external system affiliated with the TFF system or provided by a third party the Access Control Manager module may assist in determining whether the user is allowed to access TFF system information based on that determined user information with the module providing information to users only when they are authorized to receive it. Access control information can be specified for various types of information in various ways such as for information about users e.g. as specified by those users tasks e.g. as specified by the task requesters that submitted the tasks results of task performance e.g. as specified by the task requesters that submitted the tasks and or task performers that performed the tasks etc.

The illustrated embodiment of the TFF system also includes a User Interaction Manager module to assist in managing at least some types of interactions with users. For example in some embodiments task requesters and or task performers may be allowed to specify preferences and or requirements for how certain types of task related interactions are to occur such as to allow a task requester to specify how a submitted task is to be presented to a task performer and or how results from the task performer are to be obtained. In embodiments in which the TFF system includes one or more consoles not illustrated here with which users interact during the task performance process the User Interaction Manager module may further be included with or otherwise affiliated with one or more of the consoles to facilitate those user interactions with the consoles. In addition while in the illustrated embodiment the User Interaction Manager module operates in conjunction with the module to control particular types of interactions in a user configurable manner in other embodiments the module may instead directly include some or all of the types of functionality provided by the User Interaction Manager module.

To facilitate the control of user interactions the User Interaction Manager module in the illustrated embodiment provides various predefined Task Interaction Control TIC types not shown that each include a combination of multiple types of processing related to task performance and allows task requesters to specify a TIC type for use with each task that is submitted. When a task is later to be performed by a human task performer the User Interaction Manager module then controls the interactions with the human task performer by performing the types of processing specified by the TIC type associated with the task. The types of user interaction processing may include for example manipulating information associated with a task in a specified manner before it is provided to a task performer e.g. to format the information in a specified manner providing the manipulated information to the task performer in a specified manner e.g. by invoking an applet or other functionality on a computing system of the task performer that controls the display or other presentation of the manipulated task information to the task performer obtaining results of task performance from the task performer in a specified manner e.g. as input to a CGI Common Gateway Interface program and manipulating obtained task results before they are provided to the task requester e.g. to format the information in a specified manner . Multiple predefined alternatives may be provided for each of the types of user interaction processing and users may further be allowed to define new TIC types based on specified combinations of predefined alternatives and or by using new processing information supplied by the users. Other information regarding management of task related interactions with users is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

The illustrated embodiment of the TFF system further includes a User Qualification Manager module to assist in specifying qualifications of users such as qualifications of task performer users related to performing tasks and or qualifications of task requester users related to submitting available tasks and to handling results from performance of tasks. In particular in the illustrated embodiment the User Qualification Manager module allows users to specify new qualification types as well as to issue or assert specific qualifications of users of those qualification types or of predefined qualification types in embodiments in which the TFF system provides them . Information about user specified qualification types and specified user qualifications is then stored in the illustrated embodiment in database and may be used by task requesters and or task performers who have access to that information e.g. to search for users having specified qualifications to identify preferred or required qualifications for task performers who perform tasks to identify preferred or required qualifications for task requesters who have submitted tasks to determine whether and or which validation criteria should be applied to results of a performed task based at least in part on the qualifications of task performers who provided the results to identify task performers who are qualified to evaluate results of task performance by other task performers etc. . As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in some embodiments the TFF system may further assist in specifying user qualifications based on numerical assessments of prior task related activities by tracking information about the occurrences of such activities. Other information regarding qualification types and qualifications is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

The illustrated embodiment of the TFF system also includes a User Information Corroboration Manager module to assist in authenticating or otherwise corroborating information about users such as identities of users specified qualifications of users and other types of attributes of users. In particular in the illustrated embodiment the User Corroboration Manager module obtains various information that may serve as evidence for one or more pieces of information about users such as from users that supply the evidence via the API to corroborate particular pieces of user information and may then use that information for corroboration purposes in various ways. For example in some embodiments corroborative information may be provided to users along with the information that it corroborates such as to allow a recipient to evaluate the corroborative value of that information. Alternatively in some embodiments and for some types of corroborative information the Information Corroboration Manager module may automatically make an assessment of a degree and or type of corroboration provided by the information. After a piece of user information has been sufficiently corroborated it can be used in various ways such as to provide indications to others about the degree or type of corroboration for the information to limit some types of functionality to users who have sufficiently corroborated information e.g. to require that task performers for a task have a sufficiently corroborated qualification or to limit some types of access to information to users whose identities have been sufficiently corroborated etc. Other information regarding corroboration of user information is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

A Task and User Matching Manager module is also illustrated in the example embodiment of the TFF system to assist in matching available tasks to be performed and available task performers who can perform the tasks. The matching of tasks and task performers can be performed at various times and in various ways. For example in some embodiments the matching may be performed in response to requests from task performer users for tasks that meet specified criteria with the matching tasks provided to the task performer users as candidates that they can select to perform. Alternatively in some embodiments the matching may be automatically performed for at least some types of tasks when the tasks are submitted such as to assist in quickly identifying one or more task performers to perform the tasks. In addition in some embodiments the matching may be performed by matching information about the tasks and the task performers such as by identifying task performers having qualifications that meet or exceed any required qualifications specified for a task. In other embodiments the Matching Manager module may use additional information e.g. information about task requesters that submit tasks preferences of task performers and or task requesters preferred but not required criteria specified for tasks etc. when performing matching and or perform various additional activities related to matching. Other information regarding matching of tasks and task performers is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

The illustrated embodiment of the TFF system also includes an Automated Results Validation Manager module to assist in automatically validating the results of task performance by task performers such as by applying validation criteria associated with a specified task to the results of performance of that task. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere the applying of validation criteria to task performance results may include performing one or more validation tests and or actions e.g. in an indicated sequence or other manner such as with the task performance results being supplied as input to the tests or otherwise evaluated by the tests or actions. The applying of validation criteria to task performance results may produce an outcome in which the validation criteria are satisfied and the results are thus verified as being correct or otherwise validated or may instead produce an outcome in which the results fail to satisfy the validation criteria and thus are not verified or otherwise validated. The outcome of validating results may then be used in some embodiments to determine whether one or more other actions should be performed e.g. whether to pay a task performer whether to notify a task requester whether to make a task available or unavailable for performance etc. .

A Validation Criteria Definer Manager module is also included in the illustrated embodiment of the TFF system to assist users e.g. task requester users in specifying validation criteria to be associated with tasks so that the specified validation criteria may be used for automatically validating the results of performance of the tasks. In some embodiments a user may specify one or more validation criteria by providing indications of one or more predefined validation criteria types such as with one or more configurations of each predefined type if allowed e.g. to specify one or more parameters and or to indicate how the predefined type is to be used . A user may also specify one or more validation criteria in some embodiments by providing custom validation criteria such as by supplying executable code to be used for the validation. In some embodiments the module and or the TFF system may provide an interactive user interface to enable users to select and configure validation criteria for tasks and in some embodiments the TFF system may further or instead provide an API to enable users to specify validation criteria for tasks.

The illustrated embodiment of the TFF system further includes several other modules that provide additional types of functionality to assist operation of the system. For example the illustrated embodiment includes an Activity Tracking Manager module that tracks a variety of types of activities e.g. each activity taken by a user with respect to a submitted task and stores the tracked information in an activity log database . The Activity Tracking Manager module or other part of the system can then analyze the logged information to determine various types of aggregate or summary information e.g. for specific users groups of users all users types of tasks groups of related tasks etc. and make that aggregate or summary information available to users as appropriate. The illustrated embodiment also includes a Notification Manager module that provides notifications to users as appropriate such as to notify task performers when new tasks that meet specified criteria become available to notify task requesters when results of performance of their previously submitted tasks are available etc. The notifications can be performed in various ways in various embodiments such as via a console or programmatic interface of the TFF system or via other electronic communication mechanisms e.g. cellphone email instant messaging etc. . The illustrated embodiment also includes a Reward Manager module that tracks information about compensation and other rewards for users based on their activities such as to maintain a financial repository for each user for use in providing or receiving monetary compensation. In addition the illustrated embodiment includes an Accounting Manager module to perform various administrative functions for the system such as to obtain financial payments or other reward information from users.

An embodiment of the TFF system is executing in memory and it interacts with the other computing systems over the network using the network connection e.g. via the Internet and or the World Wide Web . In particular users of task requester computing systems may interact with the TFF system in order to provide information about available tasks to be performed such as by using application program executing in memory to send stored task information e.g. information about the task any associated criteria any reward for successful performance etc. and related information e.g. information to be analyzed by human task performers as part of the tasks on storage . Human task performer users similarly use task performer computing systems to interact with the TFF system such as via a program e.g. a Web browser in memory to programmatically or interactively obtain information about available tasks and provide results information for performed tasks. When information is received at the computing system about available tasks the information is stored in this example embodiment with current task information in storage e.g. temporarily until performance of the task is completed .

The TFF system and its modules not shown may also access and use various task related and user related information on storage or elsewhere such as information stored in one or more databases . In addition in some embodiments the TFF system may also interact with other optional systems executing in memory and or other optional computing systems to perform additional related functionality such as to perform payment processing in order to provide payments to human task performers on behalf of task requesters and or to obtain qualification information from third party qualification issuing authorities.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that computing systems and are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The TFF system may instead be executed by multiple interacting computing systems or devices and computing system may be connected to other devices that are not illustrated including through one or more networks such as the Internet or via the World Wide Web Web . More generally a client or server computing system or device may comprise any combination of hardware or software that can interact including without limitation desktop or other computers network devices PDAs cellphones wireless phones pagers electronic organizers Internet appliances television based systems e.g. using set top boxes and or personal digital video recorders and various other consumer products that include appropriate inter communication capabilities. In addition the functionality provided by the discussed TFF system modules may in some embodiments be combined in fewer modules or distributed in additional modules. Similarly in some embodiments the functionality of some of the modules may not be provided as part of the TFF system and or other additional functionality may be available.

Those skilled in the art will also appreciate that while various items are discussed or illustrated as being stored in memory or on storage while being used these items or portions of them can be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity. Alternatively in other embodiments some or all of the software modules and or components may execute in memory on another device and communicate with the illustrated computing system via inter computer communication. Some or all of the system modules and or data structures may also be stored e.g. as software instructions or structured data on a computer readable medium such as a hard disk a memory a network or a portable media article to be read by an appropriate drive or via an appropriate connection. The system modules and data structures can also be transmitted via generated data signals e.g. as part of a carrier wave or other analog or digital propagated signal on a variety of computer readable transmission mediums including wireless based and wired cable based mediums and can take a variety of forms e.g. as part of a single or multiplexed analog signal or as multiple discrete digital packets or frames . Such computer program products may also take other forms in other embodiments. Accordingly the present invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations.

As previously noted in at least some embodiments human task requesters submit tasks to the electronic marketplace that are available to be performed by human task performers. The types of tasks that can be submitted and performed may vary in various embodiments. In particular in some embodiments the tasks are each cognitive human performance tasks that use cognitive and or other mental skills of human task performers such as to use human judgment capabilities to form an opinion related to one or more subjective bases to use human discernment and or perception skills to select information e.g. by analyzing audio and or video information such as to perform pattern recognition to use human reasoning skills e.g. based on common sense reasoning etc. More generally in at least some embodiments the tasks to be performed are human performance tasks that are selected based on their susceptibility to performance by humans whether because automated systems are not currently capable of performing the tasks or because human task performers can perform the tasks more cheaply rapidly and or accurately. For example while automated text translation tools may translate text between languages at a limited level of proficiency human translators with appropriate qualifications may be able to perform the translations with a significantly higher proficiency level. In addition in some embodiments some or all of the tasks include questions to be answered by the task performers such as to select from an enumerated set of potential answers or to more generally generate an appropriate answer. The results of task performance can also take various forms in various embodiments including answers to questions a selection by a task performer of one or more options provided as part of the task a manipulated form of information provided to the task performer a categorization or other analysis of information provided to the task performer etc. Additional information regarding tasks and task results is discussed elsewhere.

For illustrative purposes some embodiments are described below in which a specific form of electronic marketplace provides various specific types of capabilities and functionalities with respect to various specific types of tasks and interacts with task requesters and task performers in specific types of ways. However those skilled in the art will appreciate that the techniques of the invention can be used in a wide variety of other situations including with other types of tasks with types of programmatic interfaces and or access mechanisms that do not use Web services and in situations other than with an electronic marketplace and that the invention is not limited to the exemplary details provided.

In particular illustrates an example of a task submission message that a task requester can programmatically provide to the electronic marketplace in order to describe a task that is available to be performed. In this example the task is of a type identified by the task requester as being ImageChoice as shown in line such as based on a previous specification by the task requester of that task type or instead based on a predefined type of task provided by the electronic marketplace. The task in this example involves answering the question of which one of 4 specified photographs best shows a specified subject which in this example is a business in Seattle by the name of Wildboar Tavern as indicated in lines with the answer being the selected photograph. The task may be for example one of thousands or millions of related tasks for a task requester who is creating a directory of businesses with associated photographs. As discussed in greater detail later illustrates an alternative example of encoding task information for a similar type of task.

In this example the message identifies the task requester in line of the message as having an ID of BarnabyPhoto specifies details regarding the task in lines and specifies information in lines regarding criteria and other associated information for the task. A verbal description of the task is provided in lines an indication of payment compensation for successful performance of the task is provided in lines which in this example is 6 cents to be provided to the task performer after approval of the results of task performance by the task requester and an estimate of the time needed to complete the task is indicated in line to be 30 seconds. The message also indicates various criteria in lines regarding task performers who are allowed to perform the task which in this example does not include any specific qualification criteria as shown in line or any specific task performers who are identified as being allowed to perform the task as shown in line but does specify one task performer in lines who is excluded from performing the task. Timeout information in lines indicates that the task will remain open for performance for 172 800 seconds or 48 hours but that an assignment of the task to a task performer will be kept open for only 60 seconds before the task becomes available to others. While not illustrated here in at least some embodiments the message may further contain details that specify or indicate previously specified automated validation criteria for the task. The message further indicates in lines the supplied photographs to be analyzed and in lines indicates an application that will provide functionality for comparing the images e.g. by displaying all four photographs along with a control for indicating which photograph was selected . In response to submitting this message the task requester receives a message not shown indicating that the task information was received and including a unique task ID of 109234875 that was generated for referencing the task.

In response the electronic marketplace may provide an example message as illustrated in which indicates two types of available tasks. In this example lines of the message indicate that there are 400 available tasks related to selecting photographs or other images e.g. to match them to business locations and lines of the message indicate that there 80 available tasks related to translating text between French and English. In some embodiments all available tasks may be indicated to the task performer regardless of the qualifications of the performer while in other embodiments only available tasks for which the performer is qualified and or which the performer is authorized to access may be indicated e.g. if the performer in this example has a previously established associated qualification of having French to English translation abilities .

The routine begins in step where an indication is received of information or a request and in step determines whether the sender of the information or request is authorized to perform requests of that type or provide information of that type such as based on previously defined access controls for specific users or types of users. If the routine identifies the sender as authorized in step the routine continues to step to determine whether the received indication was a request to submit a task. If so the routine continues to step to store task information received in step including any specified validation criteria or other task criteria related to task performance information about any associated rewards for performance of the task and any associated information to be analyzed or manipulated as part of the task.

The routine then continues to step to determine whether to perform automated matching to identify task performers who are appropriate to perform the task such as based on the type of task submitted and or an explicit request by the submitter of the task although in other embodiments such automated matching functionality may not be provided. In the illustrated embodiment if automated matching is to be performed the routine continues to step to execute an Automated Matcher routine and in step then receives identifications from the Automated Matcher routine of any identified task performers. The routine then notifies those identified task performers of the task in an appropriate manner e.g. based on previously specified user preferences for those task performers . After step or if it was instead determined in step that automated matching was not to be performed the routine continues to step .

If it was instead determined in step that the received indication was not to submit a task the routine continues instead to step to determine whether a request was received to perform an update for an existing task and if so continues to step to perform the update as appropriate. Such updates may take a variety of forms such as to modify information about or delete a pending task that has not been performed to perform an indicated activity related to a task e.g. to cause a reward to be provided to a task performer after the task requester has reviewed and accepted the task results to add modify or remove validation criteria associated with an existing task etc. If it was instead determined in step that the received indication was not to update an existing task the routine continues to step to determine whether the received indication was a request for information about one or more tasks and or one or more users such as for a search or browse request a request for detailed information about a particular task or user a request for summary or aggregate information about some or all types of tasks and or users etc. If so the routine continues to step to identify and obtain the requested information and then continues to step to determine whether the indicated recipient of the information is authorized to receive all of the obtained information such as based on access controls associated with any aspects or elements of the obtained information although in other embodiments the access determination may be made before or as part of the obtaining of the information . In step the routine then removes any information for which the recipient is not authorized and in step sends any remaining information to the recipient. In some embodiments indications may be provided to the recipient of any removed information for which they were not authorized while in other embodiments such indications may not be provided. After steps or the routine continues to step .

If it was instead determined in step that the received indication was not a request for information about tasks or users the routine continues instead to step to determine whether the received indication was a request from a task performer to perform an indicated task. If so the routine continues to step to retrieve and provide information about the task to the task performer in an appropriate manner e.g. in a manner specified for the task and in step obtains results of performance of the task by the task performer. In step the routine then determines whether to validate the task results such as based on whether any validation criteria are associated with the task whether any associated validation criteria are to be applied under the current circumstances etc. If so the routine continues to step to execute an Automated Results Validation Manager routine as discussed in greater detail with respect to . After step or if it was instead determined in step not to validate the task results the routine continues to step . In step the routine then determines whether to immediately send the task results to the task requester such as based on information associated with the task the outcome from execution of the Automated Results Validation Manager routine and or user preferences for the task requester. If so the routine continues to step to send the results. After step or if it was instead determined in step not to send the results to the task requester at this time the routine continues to step to optionally provide any reward associated with the task to the task performer in accordance with the task information such as if such rewards are to be provided automatically upon receipt of the task results or instead if the task results satisfy any automatically verifiable criteria specified for the task that trigger the providing of the reward e.g. automated validation criteria . After step the routine continues to step .

While the illustrated embodiment indicates a synchronous flow in which the routine waits for and obtains task results in step after sending the task information in step in other embodiments the routine could be structured in other manners such as to continue with other processing while waiting for task results if any to be sent. In addition in some situations task performers may not provide task results for a task after they accept an assignment to perform the task which may be indicated to the routine in an explicit message from the task performer that the task performer is abandoning or withdrawing from task performance or instead by not receiving task results within a specified period of time and if so the routine would continue to handle other task related requests and information. In addition while not illustrated here in other embodiments various types of notifications may be sent to task requesters related to their submitted tasks such as when a task is assigned to a task performer for performance and or when an assigned task is withdrawn from a task performer who has not completed the performance.

If it was instead determined in step that the received indication was not to perform a task the routine continues instead to step to determine whether the received indication is to request or specify information related to user qualifications and if so continues to step to execute a Qualification Manager routine to handle the qualification related activities. If it was instead determined in that the received indication was not to request or specify qualification related information the routine continues instead to step to determine whether information or a request was received related to corroboration of user qualifications or other user information and if so continues to step to execute an Information Corroboration Manager routine to handle the corroboration related activities. If it was instead determined in step that the received indication was not related to corroboration the routine continues instead to step to perform another indicated operation as appropriate such as from a task performer indicating a withdrawal from or abandonment of an assignment to perform a task to specify various types of user information e.g. information related to a user s identity or attributes information related to an account of a user with the TFF system information related to specifying access controls for information and or functionality administrative requests related to system operations requests for information related to monitoring performance of tasks or other operations of the system etc. .

After steps or the routine continues to step to execute an Activity Tracking Manager routine to log information about activities that have occurred and to generate various types of review and summary aggregate information for the system related to tasks and users. After step the routine continues to step to perform any additional housekeeping operations such as to take appropriate actions when events do not occur within specified periods of time e.g. to withdraw assigned tasks from task performers who do not timely perform the tasks to provide rewards to task performers for tasks that they have performed when task requesters do not timely reject the task results provided by the task performers etc. . After step the routine continues to step to determine whether to continue. If so or if it was determined in step that the sender was not authorized the routine returns to step and if not continues to step and ends. While the illustrated embodiment may include tasks being specified one at a time in other embodiments tasks may instead be specified in other manners such as to allow multiple tasks to be submitted together e.g. to allow for batch processing whether or not those tasks are related to each other.

The routine begins in step where an indication is received of information or a request related to user qualifications. In step the routine then determines whether the received indication was a request from a user to define a new type of qualification for use with the system such as for use by that user and or other indicated users or all users . If so the routine continues to step to obtain various information about the new qualification type and to store it for later use. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere such qualification types may include a unique name indications of one or more entities authorized to issue qualifications of that type indications of a rating scale for how qualifications of that type may be rated an indication of a particular system at which the qualification type is defined e.g. the TFF system etc.

If it was instead determined in step that the received indication was not a request to define a new type of qualification the routine continues instead to step to determine whether the received indication was a request to specify a particular qualification for a particular user such as from an issuing entity for qualifications of that type. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere in some embodiments any user is allowed to author any qualification for any user including themselves with other corroborative and or reputational information able to be used to determine how much weight to give to a particular qualification. If it is determined in step that the received indication was related to specifying a qualification the routine continues to step to obtain the received qualification information and to store it for the indicated user. As discussed in greater detail elsewhere such qualifications may include an indication of a qualification type for the qualification of a rating or value for the qualification the issuer of the qualification an indication of a particular system that stores the qualification e.g. the TFF system etc. After step a determination is made in step whether to attempt to corroborate the qualification information at this time such as based on other information that may serve as evidence of the accuracy or validity of the qualification. If so the routine continues in step to execute Information Corroboration Manager routine and if not continues to step . In other embodiments such corroboration functionality may not be provided or may be performed at other times.

If it was instead determined in step that the received indication was not a request to specify a qualification for a user the routine continues instead to step to perform another indicated operation as appropriate such as to update information about or remove existing qualifications or to provide information about user qualifications to a user or other system. In addition in some embodiments the routine may issue qualifications to at least some users such as based on past activities of the user with regard to the TFF system that had been tracked such as automatically e.g. on a periodic basis and or in response to a received request from a user to issue one or more qualifications of a specified type for one or more specified user based on specified types of tracked activity and if so could perform such qualification issuance in step . After steps or the routine continues to step and ends. While the illustrated embodiment may include qualifications and qualification type definitions being specified one at a time in other embodiments qualifications and or qualification type definitions may instead be specified in other manners such as to allow multiple qualifications and or qualification type definitions to be submitted together e.g. to allow for batch processing .

The routine begins at step where an indication is received of a corroboration request or of corroborative information for a specified type of user information. In step the routine determines whether corroborative information was received such as for a particular user qualification or other piece of user information. If so the routine continues to step to associate the corroborative information with the user qualification or other user information that it corroborates such as for later presentation to others along with that user information to allow the recipient to assess its credibility.

The routine then continues to step to determine whether to automatically assess a degree of corroboration provided by the corroborative information if possible although in some embodiments such automatic assessment functionality may not be provided. In the illustrated embodiment if the corroboration is to be automatically assessed the routine continues in step to analyze information about the corroborative information in order to assess a degree of corroboration that the information provides for the user qualification or other information to which the corroborative information applies. For example the analysis may be based at least in part on the type of corroborative information and indicators about the reliability of that information such as the source of the information and other associated information about the source such as a reputation of the source . After step the routine continues to step to optionally combine the assessed degree of corroboration for the newly received corroborative information with any other corroborative information for each user qualification or other user information to which it applies in order to assess an overall degree of corroboration for those user qualifications or other user information such as by using any of various information combination techniques e.g. averaging weighted averaging etc. .

If it was instead determined in step that the received indication was not corroborative information the routine continues instead to step to determine whether a request was received to attempt to perform corroboration for indicated user information at this time although in other embodiments such requests may not be handled. In the illustrated embodiment if a corroboration related request was received the routine continues to step to attempt to obtain appropriate corroborative information and if it is determined in step that it was obtained the routine returns to step to process the corroborative information. Attempts to obtain corroborative information may be performed in a variety of ways such as based on the type of information to be corroborated e.g. attempting to corroborate a user s identity based on querying the user to provide evidence of the identity in various forms attempting to corroborate a qualification of the user by testing the user with respect to that qualification attempting to obtain information from a third party that may have additional related information etc. .

If it was instead determined in step that a corroboration related request was not received the routine continues instead to step to perform another indicated operation related to corroboration as appropriate such as to provide corroborative information or an assessed degree of corroboration to users or other systems. After steps or or if it was instead determined in step not to assess the degree of corroboration or in step that corroborated information was not obtained the routine continues to step and ends. While not illustrated here in other embodiments additional types of functionality could be provided such as to provide a response to the sender that provided the corroborative information or corroboration related request in step such as to indicate the results of the analysis of provided corroborative information and or the results of attempting to satisfy a received corroboration related request. While the illustrated embodiment may include corroborative information being specified one piece at a time in other embodiments corroborative information may instead be specified in other manners such as to allow multiple pieces of corroborative information to be submitted together e.g. to allow for batch processing .

In the illustrated embodiment the routine begins at step where an indication is received of a new task. In step the routine identifies one or more task performers whose qualifications satisfy any qualification criteria for the new task. In some embodiment the matching of qualifications may be performed without the routine understanding the meaning or context of the qualifications e.g. based on identifying qualifications from task criteria and for task performers that are of the same qualification type and that have compatible values or ratings such as in embodiments in which the qualifications are of types defined by users. The routine then continues in step to retrieve preference information for the identified task performers to determine whether and how to notify them of the new task. In step the routine notifies the identified task performers of the new tasks in accordance with the preference information. While not illustrated here in other embodiments the automated matcher subroutine could further automatically assign new tasks to one or more human task performers as appropriate such as based on prior requests by the task performers. In addition in some embodiments the automated matcher routine may perform one or more of the indicated activities for a fee such as from the task requester who supplied the new task and or the task performers who are notified of the task. After step the routine continues to step and ends. While the illustrated embodiment may include tasks and tasks performers being matched one at a time in other embodiments tasks may be instead matched to task performers and or task performers may instead be matched to tasks in various other manners such as to allow multiple tasks and task performers to be matched together e.g. to allow for batch processing .

As previously noted validation criteria may be specified and used in various ways in various embodiments. illustrates an example of a user interface for a potential task requester user or other user to specify validation criteria for one or more tasks such as for a task being submitted or for a task type such that the specified validation criteria apply to all tasks of that type. In the example embodiment a display contains various information and user selectable controls related to validation criteria types available for selection and configuration as well as information and user selectable controls related to validation criteria that have already been selected and configured for the current task or task type. In particular the display includes a section that indicates various example predefined validation criteria types as well as user selectable controls for selecting and configuring those predefined types for a current task or task type. Although this example illustrates various specific types of validation tests that may be available some embodiments may have more less and or other available types than those illustrated and some embodiments may instead not provide any pre defined types of validation criteria such as if users are instead allowed to define one or more custom validation tests . In addition in at least some embodiments a determination may be made based on current conditions as to whether particular predefined validation criteria types are to be made available and or whether aspects of those predefined types are to be made available or configurable such as based on the current user and or on the current task or task type as one example a MAJORITY GOVERNS test as discussed in greater detail below may not be appropriate for a subjective task in which a task performer user is asked to provide their opinion or preferences and thus may not be displayed or made available for corresponding tasks or task types.

In this example radio buttons are provided in section for selecting an available validation test type to be configured and added to a current validation criteria group that is being specified although in other embodiments available validation test types may be selectable via other mechanisms e.g. drop down selection lists checkboxes buttons switches hyperlinks etc. . Radio button corresponding to a VALUE CHECK predefined type has been currently selected by a user in this example and a particular value check validation test has been specified by the user such that task performance results from a task performer will be validated by this configured test if the results are a value that is less than or equal to the number one hundred. The configured validation test is specified in this example by filling in a free form text input field with an appropriate value test e.g. an expression specified in mathematical programmatic or Boolean form and with a HELP button available for a user to obtain contextual help information and or automated assistance in creating expressions for the VALUE CHECK test although in other embodiments the configuration may be performed in other manners. In this example the validation criteria group being specified already includes an indication of a previously configured MAJORITY GOVERNS test which will validate task performance results from a task performer if they are in agreement with a majority of task performance results from a total of 5 task performers e.g. if the task performance results from the task performer match task performance results from two other of the task performers giving a majority of 3 of the 5 independent task performance results . The configured VALUE CHECK test may be added to the current validation criteria group by selection of the ADD TEST button in this example which will cause an indication of that test not shown to similarly appear in section with the MAJORITY GOVERNS test for example the newly added test may appear in the position indicated in section by 2 . An additional one or more validation tests may similarly be added to the current validation criteria group by a user selecting and configuring one or more validation test types.

In the illustrated embodiment each of the predefined validation test types has one or more user configurable aspects although some predefined validation test types in other embodiments may not be user configurable or modifiable. As one example the MAJORITY GOVERNS test includes an indication of the test name and has two user configurable parameters that may be specified via text entry box to allow the user to specify a TOTAL NUM RESULTS that indicates a total number of independent results from task performer users that are to be obtained and via a PLURALITY OK checkbox to allow the user to indicate whether a plurality of results is sufficient to satisfy this instance of the majority governs test rather than a strict majority . In addition section further illustrates various other user selectable mechanisms for a user to specify various configurable aspects such as a drop down selection list for configuring a TYPE CHECK test of the data type of task performance results a text entry box for entering a value check expression for a VALUE CHECK test to evaluate one or more values of task performance results and SPECIFY buttons and for a user to invoke interactive interfaces via which the user can supply additional information. For example selecting button may cause a dialog box to appear via which a user may specify the qualifications of task performers that are to act as part of a multi stage validation test and evaluate and confirm task performance results from other task performers while selecting button may cause a dialog box to appear via which a user may upload or otherwise specify a user created executable program.

The user interface display further illustrates an EDIT GROUP button available to a user to modify validation tests in the current validation criteria group e.g. to display an interactive interface via which one or more tests may be removed or to change the order of current tests or to select a previously specified validation criteria group as a current group. An INTER TEST RELATIONSHIPS button is also available to allow a user to define and or modify relationships between validation tests in the current validation criteria group such as to allow the user to specify logic or other indications of how the various validation tests are to be applied e.g. in a particular order such as in series or parallel a number of times such as if looping or other constructs for repeated use are allowed in a particular relative manner such as if conditional logic is used to determine whether and when to apply a particular test etc. . Additional group related attributes may also be specified in some embodiments such as if the group is to be applied only to results from certain task performers or in other specified circumstances or to indicate criteria to determine when the validation tests of the group are satisfied e.g. if any validation test of the group succeeds if all validation tests of the group succeed etc. . Relationships between this group and one or more other related validation criteria groups e.g. other validation criteria groups for the same task or task type may also be defined such as an order to apply the groups whether task performance results for the task or task type are validated if any validation criteria group succeeds or if all validation criteria groups succeed etc. Additionally a DEFINE NEW GROUP button is available for a user to indicate that a new validation criteria group is to be initiated whether for the same task or task type or instead for a new task or task type. A DONE button is also available for a user to indicate completion of interacting with the validation criteria specification and configuration user interface such as to cause any specified validation criteria to be saved in association with the current task or task type. While the user interface has been provided as an illustrative example it will be appreciated that validation criteria may be specified in a variety of other manners in other embodiments.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine begins at step where an indication is received of a task or task type. In step the illustrated embodiment of the routine determines one or more types of validation criteria that are available for the task or task type such as by selecting predefined types of validation tests that are appropriate for the types of results that will be obtained for the task or task type although in other embodiments such determination may not be performed. The routine then continues to step to provide indications of the determined validation tests or all available validation tests if the determination in step is not performed to the user so that the user may select and configure validation tests into a validation criteria group. In this illustrated embodiment each validation criteria group associated with a task or task type indicates one or more validation tests to be used together in an indicated manner while multiple validation criteria groups for a task or task type serve as alternatives for validating results for the task or task type. In other embodiments validation tests and other validation criteria may instead be specified in manners other than validation criteria groups.

After step the routine continues to step to determine if a validation criteria group is to be defined such as based on input from the user. If so the routine continues to step to obtain information about one or more validation tests that are selected and configured by the user for the validation criteria group being defined. The routine then continues to step to optionally receive indications of relationships between the selected validation tests within the validation criteria group. In some embodiments if no indications of relationships between the validation tests are received the validation tests may be applied in any order e.g. simultaneously in a serial manner based on order of selection etc. while in other embodiments relationships between validation tests may be automatically inferred e.g. based on any dependencies between validation tests using an order of precedence for different validation test types etc. . After step the routine proceeds to step to determine whether to define another validation criteria group for the task or task type indicated in step . If so the routine returns to step and if not proceeds to step to store the one or more defined validation criteria groups in a manner so that they are associated with the task or task type indicated in step such that the validation criteria of the defined validation criteria groups are available for automatically validating results of performance of associated tasks . After step or if it was instead determined in step that no validation criteria group is to be defined the routine continues to step and ends.

The routine begins at step where an indication is received to validate results of performance of a task by a task performer. In step the routine then obtains one or more validation criteria groups that are associated with the task such as by receiving them in step retrieving stored information e.g. from the Available Tasks database of based on the particular task and or a type of the task etc. The routine then continues in steps to apply validation criteria to the task performance results to determine whether the results are validated. In the illustrated embodiment if multiple validation criteria groups are available the routine selects the groups to apply in a particular order and considers the results to be validated if any of the validation criteria groups succeed although in other embodiments the validation activities may be performed in other manners e.g. by applying multiple of the validation criteria groups simultaneously by considering results to be validated only if multiple or all of the validation criteria groups succeed etc. . In particular in step the routine determines a next validation criteria group to currently use selecting a first validation criteria group during a first time at step . After step the routine continues to step to optionally retrieve results from related previous task performances such as if the previous task performance results are to be used as part of one or more of the automated validation criteria e.g. if validation depends on agreement with task performance results from other task performers .

The routine then proceeds to step to perform one or more validation actions associated with the current validation criteria group such as to perform one or more validation tests included in the group. In some embodiments the validation criteria group may include one or more indications of relationships between multiple validation tests within the validation group and the validation tests and other actions to be performed may be determined in accordance with the indicated relationships. In some embodiments performance of one or more validation actions may involve one or more additional performances related to the same or similar tasks such as by obtaining one or more evaluations of a task performance result by one or more other users as part of a multi stage validation test. After step the routine continues to step to determine whether the outcome of performing the validation actions was successful e.g. if the results satisfy the corresponding validation criteria and the results are determined to be validated. If not the routine proceeds to step to determine if any additional validation criteria groups are available and if so returns to step to determine a next current validation criteria group. If instead there are no additional validation criteria groups or if it was determined in step that the results are validated the routine continues to step to optionally perform other processing as appropriate e.g. saving information related to performance of validation actions for later use taking additional actions to correct or replace task performance results that are not validated etc. . The routine then continues to step to provide an indication of whether the results were determined to be validated and then proceeds to step and returns.

While not illustrated in this example embodiment of the routine this or a related routine may further take a variety of other types of actions in other embodiments. For example if the validation of the results of performance of a task fails various actions may be taken to correct or replace those results as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. Moreover in some embodiments additional actions may be taken after automated validation of results of task performance indicates that those results failed validation. In some circumstances the electronic marketplace may automatically take one or more actions to review the validation failure to verify that it was correct e.g. periodically such as to ensure continuing correct operation of the electronic marketplace if other information reflects that the validation failure may be incorrect such as if the task performer users have a long history of providing correct results at a very high rate etc. . Such actions may include manual review of the results and or validation process e.g. by other evaluation task performer users such as those with higher qualifications than those of the initial task performer users who provided the results or by representatives of the electronic marketplace and or use of other automated validation criteria if available . Furthermore in some embodiments the review of a validation failure to verify that it was correct may be initiated in other manners such as if the initial task performer users who provided the results initiate an appeal of the validation failure. In some embodiments such an appeal initiated by an initial task performer user may be available only under certain circumstances e.g. only a limited number of times per period of time only for tasks with fees above a minimum threshold only for task performer users who have successfully performed a minimum number and or percentage of prior tasks etc. . Moreover in some embodiments an appeal initiated by an initial task performer user may be performed by the electronic marketplace for a fee from the task performer user e.g. a fee only if the validation failure is verified as correct a fee only if the validation failure is determined to be incorrect and the initial results are determined to be validated such as a portion of the fee that the task performer user will receive for the successful performance of the task a fee regardless of initial validation failure correctness etc. .

As previously noted a variety of validation tests and other types of validation criteria may be used in various embodiments and such validation tests and other validation criteria may each have one or more associated actions to be performed as part of applying the validation criteria. As one example a type check validation test may perform one or more actions to determine whether results conform to an indicated type or format e.g. integers floating point numbers alpha numeric text Boolean URL string etc. . As another example a value check validation test may perform one or more actions to determine whether one or more values from results satisfy various expressions or other indications of allowable values including mathematical expressions e.g. number value equality inclusion in a range or enumerated group mathematical operations etc. programmatic expressions e.g. regular expressions string manipulation and comparison etc. Boolean expressions e.g. using relational operators Boolean operators etc. etc. Such format based expressions may include for example various patterns corresponding to desired types of information such as phone number IP addresses etc. Additionally some validation tests may perform actions to analyze multiple results for the same task to determine if an indicated amount of the multiple results agree with the amount able to be indicated in various ways e.g. a specified number or percentage of received results a determined plurality majority supermajority etc. of received and or requested results etc. . As another example a multi stage validation test may perform actions to determine if results of a task performance are confirmed by one or more other task performers or other users such as by evaluating the initial results independently producing the same results etc. for example in such situations the actions may include automatically submitting one or more new tasks to the electronic marketplace with qualifications so that higher qualified task performers perform the new tasks. When a validation test uses results from multiple performances of the same or related tasks the TFF system may automatically submit additional tasks or request additional task performance as appropriate until sufficient results are received or some other related event e.g. a timeout occurs.

In addition in some embodiments user specified custom validation tests may be used for performing validation of task performance results. For example in some embodiments users may write validation test software that is executable by the TFF system e.g. executable binary code uncompiled software code scripts etc. and upload that software such that it may be executed by the TFF system to perform validation of task performance results. Some embodiments may additionally or instead provide an interactive user interface to assist a user in creating such custom validation test software e.g. by interactively selecting and configuring software commands and functions provided by the system by providing building block functions objects or other program sub components etc. .

As previously indicated in some embodiments one or more validation tests may be selected and configured to be included as part of the validation criteria associated with a task or task type. In cases where multiple validation tests are included in the validation criteria associated with a task or task type the validation criteria may be divided into one or more validation criteria groups. In some embodiments the validation criteria groups may exist as alternative validation criteria for validating results i.e. if results satisfy any one of the multiple validation criteria groups then the results are validated as validation criteria having defined relationships e.g. relationships defined by precedence logical operators relational operators and or other controls and or as validation criteria that share one or more common attributes e.g. one validation group may apply only to results performed by task performers with certain qualifications while another validation group may apply to results from performers with certain other qualifications etc. .

As previously noted in some embodiments relationships within a validation criteria group may be defined in a variety of ways including by one or more of precedence e.g. order of operation logical operations e.g. AND OR NOT XOR etc relational operations e.g. greater than less than equality etc and or other control operations e.g. if then else statements looping controls etc. . Such relationships within a validation criteria group may provide additional control over when one or more validation actions may be performed and what combinations of validation actions will successfully validate task performance results. As an illustrative example validation criteria specified for a task may include one validation group that has two validation tests a type check validation test and a majority governs validation test. If the relationship between the two validation tests in this example was configured to be a logical OR then task performance results that satisfy either validation test would be successfully validated and if the first performed validation test is determined to be satisfied then performance of the second is optional however if the first test failed to be satisfied then the second test would be performed. As a further example if a logical AND relationship was configured to exist between the validation tests in the example validation group then the task performance results must satisfy both validation tests for successful validation. In some embodiments validation tests within a validation group may have precedence associated with them such that more efficient validation tests have higher precedence and are performed prior to performing less efficient and or more expensive tests. For example a type check validation test may be faster and or cheaper to perform than a multi stage validation test accordingly the type check validation test may have a higher precedence than the multi stage validation test. In such situations if a validation criteria group were configured such that successful validation of task performance results includes passing both a type check validation test and a multi stage validation test the type check validation test may be performed and satisfied prior to performing the multi stage validation test.

In some embodiments validation tests and or validation criteria groups may be configured to operate under various conditions. For example validation tests and or validation criteria groups may be configured to operate for task performance results from task performers having certain specified qualifications e.g. having qualifications of a certain type and or level including degrees certifications experience etc. . In such situations task requesters may maximize their opportunities to receive high quality results from an electronic marketplace by submitting a task to a large group of available task performers with various qualifications and specifying and configuring validation criteria associated with the task in such a manner that results from task performers with higher qualifications will have less automated validation than results from task performers with lower qualifications.

In at least some embodiments an electronic marketplace may also provide a programmatic interface to a task requester or other user for specifying validation criteria to be used in automated results validation whether in addition to or instead of interactive approaches similar to those noted above. Such a programmatic interface may be provided via one or more APIs of the electronic marketplace e.g. APIs based on Web services etc. . In addition in some embodiments an electronic marketplace may be configured to automatically enforce validation criteria similar to those previously noted without being instructed to so by a task requester for a particular task e.g. if automatic type checking is performed on certain results . Furthermore other embodiments may use automated learning techniques to improve the performance of the automated results validation.

As previously noted a variety of types of tasks can be submitted and performed in various embodiments and may include tasks that involve a variety of types of activities by human task performers such as analysis of one or more supplied pieces of information e.g. to translate a supplied word or paragraph to select which of several supplied photographs best represents a specified subject matter or to identify whether a supplied human signature is authentic such as by comparison to a known sample and or on another basis or retrieval or identification of desired information. In some embodiments the tasks may each require little time of the human task performer e.g. at most a few seconds while in other embodiments tasks may be sufficiently complex to take significant amounts of time e.g. hours or days . In addition while in some embodiments each of the tasks may be a cognitive human performance task that uses cognitive and or other mental capabilities of human task performers in other embodiments some or all of the tasks may include physical activities by one or more human task performers e.g. to take and supply a specified type of picture whether instead of or in addition to one or more cognitive or other mental activities of one or more human task performers.

In addition in some embodiments each task may be a stand alone activity that is unrelated to other tasks while in other embodiments some tasks may each be a small part of a larger collective such as to allow a large number of unrelated human task performers to perform a time consuming collective task in parallel in a very short time e.g. without the individual task performers even being aware that the individual tasks are part of a larger collective task such as in a manner analogous to grid computing. When individuals tasks are part of a larger collective task a single task requester may in some situations collect and aggregate or analyze the individual results while in other situations some or all of the aggregation or analysis activities may instead be one or more other tasks made available through the electronic marketplace. Other information related to users performing tasks is included in pending commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 976 717 filed Oct. 12 2001 and entitled A Hybrid Machine Human Computing Arrangement. 

A non exclusive list of examples of types of human performance tasks that may be performed via the electronic marketplace include the following translation or conversion of information of various forms e.g. text speech and other audio images and other video etc. between languages and or information form e.g. transcription of audio material selection of one or more groups of visual information e.g. photographs or other images and or audio information e.g. songs voice messages etc. that satisfy a specified criteria e.g. to identify groups that are similar that have specified characteristics etc. supplying answers to specified questions e.g. to obtain information for use in research for marketing purposes for use as feedback for use with computer human interface and other types of user studies for use as pre release and or post release reviews of or reactions to products and or content etc. and or supplying other types of specified information e.g. a missing description for a specified item available from a Web store outsourced tasks of various types e.g. engineering marketing sales customer support etc. and analysis of content of various forms of information to identify specified types of content e.g. spam pornography and other obscene or offensive material etc. and or to otherwise categorize the information e.g. according to a predefined taxonomy based on a determined source or other aspect of the information etc. . When information is to be analyzed as part of a task that information can be provided to a task performer in a variety of ways such as from the TFF system along with other task related information by providing a link or other indicator to the task performer to allow the task performer to retrieve the information e.g. from the TFF system from the task requester for the task from a location or source external to the TFF system etc. .

As one specific example a task requester may submit tasks on behalf of a store e.g. a Web store that each request at least two human task performers to submit a specified type of data that is missing for one or more items offered by the store e.g. performance specifications for a stereo . The first two human task performers that submit the same or sufficiently similar data for a task will each receive payment e.g. 0.25 thus providing information with some degree of reliability in a manner that minimizes overhead for the task performers and the task requester. As another examples tasks may include analyzing results of task performance from other task performers such as to corroborate or verify the accuracy or other aspect of interest of the results e.g. to have a human task performer with a higher level or qualification and or additional qualifications review the results from less qualified task performers to compare results from multiple task performers for the same or related tasks e.g. to compare performance of human task performers to automated task performers such as for research purposes or to compare performance of different groups of human task performers to analyze results in an attempt to determine whether the task performer is human or not e.g. for research purposes or to verify or corroborate the identity and or qualifications of a task performer etc.

As previously noted in some embodiments a variety of types of user qualifications can be specified and used and may further in some embodiments each be associated with a specified qualification type. Such qualification types may include a variety of associated information in various embodiments including a name e.g. for later reference purposes a rating scale to indicate allowed values e.g. any floating point number true false an enumerated ranked set of values etc. indications of one or more entities or entity types who may issue specific qualifications of the qualification type to users expiration conditions e.g. an expiration date time or other indications of how and when qualifications of the type are effective an indication of the user e.g. a unique user identifier who specified the qualification type e.g. to limit who can modify delete and or view information about the qualification type etc. In some embodiments each qualification may be stored in or as part of a qualification data structure that may contain some or all of the indicated types of associated information whether using a qualification data structure specific to a specified qualification type or independent of any specific qualification type. In addition for embodiments in which multiple instances or versions of the TFF system are operating or in which other types of systems with overlapping types of functionality may interact the specified qualification types may further have an associated indication of the system at which the qualification type is specified. Moreover in some embodiments users may be allowed to define new qualification types for use within the system.

As previously noted task performer qualifications can also take various forms in various embodiments including self assertions by a user of qualifications that they possess human generated ratings of human task performers by other humans based on prior task performances by the task performers e.g. feedback from task requesters who supplied the tasks and or ratings by other reviewers of the past performances and credentials supplied by third party authorities e.g. educational degrees or other accomplishments from specified educational institutions awards and other recognitions from specified organizations or contests recognitions of levels of training or knowledge etc. . One form of credential that may be used in some embodiments is a reputation or other rating of a user that is supplied by a third party as a service such as for a fee. A discussion of techniques related to generating and providing user rating information that could be used in some embodiments for user qualifications is included in pending commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 646 341 filed Aug. 22 2003 and entitled Managing Content Based On Reputation which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Task performer qualifications may also include various quantitative measurements by the electronic marketplace of tracked activities of human task performers including measurements related to a specific task average and or cumulative measurements over a specified group of multiple tasks and or a specified period of time and information about a rate of change for one or more measurements over one or more specified periods of time. A non exclusive list of types of measurements that may be used in various embodiments include the number of tasks assigned to a task performer the number or percentage of tasks assigned to a task performer that are completed the number or percentage of tasks completed by a task performer that are approved or rejected e.g. by the task requester the number or percentage of assigned tasks that are explicitly abandoned or dropped by a task performer before completion the number or percentage of assigned tasks that are withdrawn from a human task performer before completion e.g. by the electronic marketplace for failure to complete the task within a specified time limit the number or percentage of tasks that are offered to a task performer that are refused if an embodiment includes offering tasks to task performers an amount of time taken before performing assigned tasks e.g. an average or distribution over time etc. In some embodiments task requesters may also be given qualifications based on quantitative measurements by the electronic marketplace of tracked activities such as the number of submitted available tasks from a task requester the number or percentage of submitted tasks that are removed before assignment by a task requester the number or percentage of completed tasks that are approved or rejected by a task requester the number or percentage of submitted tasks that are modified by a task requester the timeliness of a task requester in providing payment when due etc. In addition in some embodiments task performers may be able to provide qualifications for task requesters by rating them such as for task performers that have been involved in performance of tasks submitted by those task requesters. Such ratings may be based on for example the reasonableness of the task requester in categorizing their submitted tasks in providing appropriate compensation for the level of task difficulty in providing payment after satisfactory task results are provided etc.

In some embodiments the electronic marketplace may also provide rankings of task performers relative to other task performers on the basis of one or more of the various types of qualifications and a task performer s ranking level could further be used as a qualification e.g. a performer in the top 10 for a specified quantitative measurement . More generally a performer qualification can in some embodiments include any information about a performer that can be measured or identified.

Thus as previously noted a variety of types of information may serve as qualifications in some embodiments. More generally in some embodiments any user may specify any qualification for any user including themselves with the qualification measuring any dimension or aspect using any rating scale and may further include objective and or subjective qualifications. The meaning or context of a qualification may in some embodiments be maintained externally to the TFF system e.g. by the issuers of the qualifications and or task requesters that use them as criteria for tasks being submitted such that the TFF system performs tracking of and matching of qualifications as arbitrary data values without knowledge or use of the meaning of the qualifications. Thus in such embodiments any user can act as their own issuing authority to issue qualifications and to later use the qualifications by searching for users that have them and or tasks that include them in their task criteria. In addition in some embodiments qualifications may be issued to and used for entities that are not directly associated with users of the TFF system such as qualifications for various types of third party entities e.g. issuers of qualifications .

In addition in some embodiments the activities of users with other systems may be used as qualifications or in other manners such as based on importing data from such other systems. For example in some embodiments the TFF system may be affiliated with or otherwise receive information related to shopping related activities of users such as with a Web retailer or other online merchant. Types of information that may be obtained and used from a retailer s system include the user s browsing history search history click stream history click through history purchase or rental history payment and or credit history returns history history of service related activities e.g. frequency and number of calls to customer service use of discounts and purchase incentives contributions of content and or information including various details about such contributions such as length subject matter frequency of submission quality as judged by other users etc. provided by the user e.g. reviews of items lists or groups of items of interest etc. participation in various community based features reputation within the system e.g. based on voting or other rating by other users browser and browsing device used etc. Similarly qualification and other information from the TFF system may in some embodiments be able to be exported to other systems for use by those other systems. In addition when such types of information are available they can also be used in other ways. For example if recommendation information is available for a user based on a relationship of the user to other users such recommendation information may be used as qualification information for the user e.g. this user is likely to want to do tasks of a certain type and or to recommend tasks to a task performer e.g. other task performers similar to you perform tasks of this type .

Information about qualification related activities can also be tracked and stored in various ways. For example performance related qualification scores could be tracked for all tasks regardless of task type and or required qualifications. Alternatively activities could be tracked for particular types of tasks or groups of related tasks e.g. to determine that a task performer completes tasks with qualification A 95 of the time but completes tasks with qualification B only 80 of the time . Similarly activities could be tracked for categories of tasks such as to determine that a task performer completes pornography identification tasks correctly 100 of the time but only completes czech english translation tasks satisfactorily 80 of the time.

When searching for information related to qualifications and or tasks the TFF system in some embodiments allows a variety of types of searches to be performed. A non exclusive list of example searches that a user could execute includes the following 

All tasks that I created accepted and status progress of same e.g. by a task requester and or task performer 

All tasks currently available for acceptance including the necessary qualifications for each task and the payment reward for each e.g. by a task performer 

All users to whom new qualifications have been issued in the last week e.g. by any user with sufficient permissions 

All users having a nickname attribute with a value of Jill e.g. by anyone with sufficient permissions to see user nicknames 

How many task requesters of available tasks have qualification B e.g. by a task performer such as a task performer who will only do tasks from certain task requesters 

How many users have qualifications X and Y or Z but not W Of these which ones have qualification X with a value above 90 e.g. by anyone 

Which task performers completed tasks requiring qualification X this week What percent of their total completed tasks were approved by the requesters e.g. by anyone 

Of all qualification types containing C in the name field what percent were created in the twelve month period ending Jun. 30 2004 e.g. by anyone 

How many qualifications containing the string St. Louis in their name were issued last month by or on behalf of Issuer ABC e.g. by anyone 

In some embodiments the system further provides functionality to assist in authenticating or otherwise corroborating information about users such as identities of users specified qualifications of users and other kinds of attributes of users. In particular various information may be obtained and used to serve as evidence to corroborate one or more pieces of information about users such as by obtaining information about a user s past activities e.g. feedback and or rating information related to the activities testimonials or other assertions from others as to the accuracy of information about a user information about a user s reputation information about a user s status within a community or group e.g. a social networking group and more generally any observable indicia that can serve to corroborate user information. The corroborative information may be obtained in various ways including from third party sources and or from a user whose information is being corroborated and the obtaining of the corroborative information may be initiated in various ways including as initiated by a user who is supplying corroborative information and or initiated in an automated manner e.g. based on a need for the corroborative information . In addition in some embodiments corroboration is further enhanced by using additional techniques such as by monitoring activities of a user and or by occasionally challenging a user e.g. by giving the user a short test to verify information about the user e.g. to obtain information to confirm or contradict a user s qualifications and or identity .

As one example of corroborating users identities based on evidence or other information from third parties the third party may be an issuer of credit cards and or debit cards with such a card providing evidence that the cardholder name on the card is the actual name of the cardholder. A variety of other types of evidence or information associated with third parties may similarly be used to provide information about a user s identity including information about a bank account or other financial account of a user government issued information for a user e.g. a driver s license passport social security number voting identity card etc. other government records e.g. property records etc. In such situations a user may obtain such evidence from the third party and later provide the evidence to the system or alternatively the system may in some embodiments directly interact with a third party to obtain such evidence for a user. For example the system may interact with a third party card issuer or government agency or instead with a third party that provides a service involving verifying users actual identities based on appropriate evidence and then providing assurances of the verified actual identity information to others upon request.

As previously noted various types of evidence or other corroborative information related to users identities can be obtained in various ways in various embodiments and can be used in various ways to identify and or corroborate a user s identity. For example in some embodiments information about a user s identity may be obtained by using information stored by a telephone service provider. In some such embodiments a user may be provided with a toll free number of a system performing identity corroboration activities and when the user calls that toll free number the entity can gather user identity information provided by the telephone service provider with that call e.g. a number from which the user is calling and a name associated with that number such as for use in corroborating an actual name that the user previously provided. Information may be gathered about users in similar manners from other third parties that have similar information such as by using Caller ID technology with non toll free numbers doing a reverse number lookup on a phone number provided by a user in order to identify the name of the user associated with that phone number gathering information about a user based on an electronic communication sent by the user e.g. based on an email address used by the user a domain name of the user an instant messaging or other message sender identity etc. and or gathering information stored by other providers of services to the user e.g. an Internet Service Provider utility companies educational institutions medical facilities etc. . More generally in some embodiments the system may provide a predefined API and or one or more Web services via which others can provide corroborative and other information about users.

In some embodiments information about users identities may further be obtained and or corroborated based on groups to which the users belong and or other affiliations of the users. For example a user may be able to demonstrate membership or other affiliation with a group or organization that provides publicly available information about its members or other affiliated users thus providing some corroboration that the user s asserted identity is accurate based on the asserted identity being in the publicly available membership or affiliation information. Alternatively a user may be part of a social networking group or other group of users such that one or more other users of the group will attest to an identity of the user. In such embodiments a user may provide contact and other information about one or more of such other users e.g. email addresses and a system performing identity corroboration activities may then use the provided information to assist in corroborating the user s identity such as by using the contact information to query those other users to provide corroborative statements or other information about the user s identity. In addition when information from other users is used to corroborate information about a user e.g. based on a social networking group an additional factor that may be considered is whether a group of users is merely acting as a self corroborating body such that users of the group are corroborated only by each other or whether other external evidence is available to provide additional corroboration.

After corroborative information is obtained it may be used in various ways. In some embodiments one or more pieces of corroborative information for a piece of user information e.g. a user qualification may be presented or otherwise provided with the user information such as to allow the recipient of the user information to evaluate its accuracy credibility and reliability based on the associated corroborative information. In other embodiments the system may attempt to automatically assess the corroborative information in order to determine a confidence level or value or other assessment of the user information being corroborated such as based on a type of the corroborative information a degree of correspondence between the corroborative information and the information being corroborated and or on the source of the corroborative information e.g. to affect the weight given the corroborative information such as based on a reputation of the source . In addition in some embodiments some of the types of corroboration related activities may be performed for a fee such as from the user whose information is being corroborated.

A particular type of performer qualification that is available in some embodiments relates to performance of a human task performer on one or more qualifying examinations. For example a task requester who plans to submit multiple tasks of a similar type may first create a task with a known or desired performance result. That task may then be made available via the electronic marketplace as a qualifying examination task for performance by human task performers that are interested in performing other later tasks for the task requester. After a human task performer provides results for the qualifying examination task those results can be graded relative to the known or desired results in order to determine whether and or at what level the human task performer can successfully perform the task. A specified level of performance for the qualifying examination task e.g. having a minimum specified score or scoring at a minimum percentile relative to other human task performers can then be used as a performer qualification criteria for later tasks by that task requester. Such qualifying examination tasks can be performed in various ways in various embodiments including with or without a fee paid to successful performers of the task with a fee paid by task performers for a task performance attempt and or completion as a task available to any task performers or to only task performers that meet other specified criteria e.g. a first specified number of human task performers to successfully pass the test to human task performers who have other specified qualifications etc. and as a task that is explicitly identified to task performers as a qualifying examination or that is not identified as such.

In addition to performer qualification criteria task requesters can also specify a variety of other types of criteria for tasks. For example in some embodiments task requesters may specify criteria related to when a task is to be performed such as an expiration time period for initial assignment to a human task performer and or an expiration time limit for a human task performer to provide results of task performance after a task has been assigned to them. A task requester may also in some embodiments specify information about a format in which results are to be supplied including by supplying information to the task performer related to the results format e.g. a response form to be completed by the human task performer or an executable results program that the human task performer is to use to provide results and or to perform the task . The performer qualification criteria and other types of criteria can also be specified in various forms including as an exact match and as a minimum or maximum threshold and for various activities related to a task e.g. to allow task assignment to verify performance results as being satisfactory to determine whether a value of a task performer s qualification is sufficient such as based on a generated confidence level or value for appropriateness of the qualification value to determine whether a task performer s qualification is sufficiently corroborated such as based on a generated confidence level or value based on a degree or amount of corroboration etc. . Such thresholds may also be specified by other users e.g. task performers and or automatically by the TFF system in other situations and embodiments.

In addition in some embodiments task requesters may supply additional task related information to assist task performers in identifying appropriate or interesting tasks such as one or more categories for the task e.g. based on a type of the task and or one or more keywords corresponding to the task. Such category and or keyword information can then later be used by task performers when searching for and or browsing for tasks of interest. In other embodiments such category and or keyword information may instead be automatically generated by the electronic marketplace based on analysis of information related to the task e.g. by using a textual description of the task provided by the task requester by using historical information about tasks supplied by task requesters by using information that is supplied with the task to be analyzed by using information about criteria specified for the task etc. .

As previously noted in at least some embodiments the task requests may also each specify one or more fees to be paid by the task requester to one or more task performers for successful performance of a task. In such embodiments the fee can be specified to be paid under any of a variety of circumstances including in a manner related to a specified state of a task e.g. to the first task performer whose performance results are explicitly accepted by the task requester to the first task performer whose performance results are automatically accepted by the electronic marketplace to the first task performer who supplies performance results to the electronic marketplace to the first task performer to whom a requested task is assigned etc. . In other situations multiple task performers may receive payment for performance of a task such as the first X task performers that provide results where X is a specified number by the task requester multiple task performers whose results are in agreement and form a specified level e.g. a majority of performance results from X task performers etc.

In other embodiments payment for task requests can be determined in other ways such as based on bidding by task performers e.g. as part of a standard or Dutch auction as a variable rate that is dependent on a degree or amount of success in providing satisfactory performance results etc. In addition in some embodiments the task requester may allow the electronic marketplace to specify the associated payment for a task e.g. for a fee such as based on a category of the task on dynamic pricing based on current conditions at the time of task request as part of a premium service for which the electronic marketplace guarantees some aspects of the results e.g. a maximum time to receive performance results a minimum level of performance results etc. . Moreover in some embodiments the system provides information to task requesters to assist them in manually pricing tasks such as by providing historical pricing information for tasks of the same type or for other related tasks by providing summary information about current pricing and current pricing trends etc.

After payment is determined to be provided to one or more task performers for a task the payment can be made in a variety of ways. In some embodiments the electronic marketplace or an associated system may provide accounts to task requester and or task performer users and if so payments may be made from those accounts of task requesters and or to those accounts of task performers. In other embodiments the electronic marketplace may also interact with third party systems in order to effect payment such as credit card companies banks etc. In addition in some embodiments a variety of other types of payments could be made whether in addition to or instead of payments from task requesters to task performers such as payments to the electronic marketplace from task requesters and or task performers for any of the functionality provided by the electronic marketplace and or such as payments to task requesters from task performers for performing tasks of the task requesters. More generally in some embodiments payments and other rewards can be specified to flow from any one or more parties to any one or more other parties whether task performers task requesters the TFF system external parties etc. A discussion of payment related techniques that could be used to make payments in some embodiments is included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 894 347 filed Jul. 19 2004 and entitled Automatic Authorization Of Programmatic Transactions which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

After a task request has been submitted to the electronic marketplace task performers can obtain information about available tasks in a variety of ways. In some embodiments task performers will make requests to the electronic marketplace to identify tasks that are currently available that meet specified indicia such as all currently available tasks or tasks whose specified qualification criteria are satisfied by the current qualifications of the task performer. While some such task information requests may be made interactively in some embodiments in other embodiments at least some such requests may instead be made in a programmatic manner such as by using a specialized program or instructions e.g. a client side program macro plug in etc. that is designed to retrieve such information for a task performer e.g. that is obtained from the electronic marketplace or from a task requester for their tasks . In addition to searching for a task based on qualifications of the task performer the task performers can also specify a variety of other types of information about tasks to identify such as tasks available from specified task requesters tasks in specified categories or having specified keywords tasks having specified associated payments or other associated criteria e.g. expiration date tasks from task requesters who satisfy specified requester qualification criteria etc.

In addition to searching for tasks task performers can also request that tasks be assigned to them in various ways such as by identifying one or more specific tasks of interest and or by identifying tasks that meet specified conditions e.g. based on task criteria an associated reward for a task information about or an identity of a task requester who submitted the task etc. . After a task has been assigned to a task performer the task performer may then interact with the electronic marketplace whether interactively or programmatically to provide performance results information based on performance of the task. In addition in some embodiments a task performer may specify in various ways that they desire to receive a string of assignments of related tasks such as tasks of a specified task type. By creating such a pipeline of incoming tasks the task performer may be able to perform the tasks more efficiently e.g. if sufficient tasks are assigned to a task performer to allow them to constantly have a queue of available tasks to be performed and correspondingly may be charged a fee in some embodiments for receiving such functionality. The creation of such a string of task assignments may be performed in various ways such as by registering a notification and or assignment request with the TFF system for a specified type of task by repeatedly executing a search or assignment request with the TFF for a specified type of task by using an application program to automatically perform such repeated searches etc.

In some embodiments the determination of whether a task is to be assigned to a task performer is based at least in part on information specified for the task by the task requester. For example each task may allow a specified number e.g. one of simultaneous or sequential assignments of a task to task performers. Moreover in some embodiments an assignment of a task is made in such a manner as to lock that assignment e.g. for a specified period of time so that it is not available to other task performers while in other embodiments such locking may not be performed. Thus for example if a task requester desired results as soon as possible and was willing to pay only the first human task performer who provided satisfactory results the task requester could specify that the task be made available to any number of human task performers and that it not be locked upon assignment resulting in a race between task performers to be the first to supply successful results. Alternatively the task requester may instead desire satisfactory results from only a single task performer but may provide for the task to be locked after it is assigned to a human task performer to allow them a specified amount of time e.g. a minute or a day to provide satisfactory results before the task will be made available to other task performers.

As another example the task requester may desire responses from multiple task performers e.g. to enable comparison of multiple responses as an automated accuracy check and if so may allow a specified number of simultaneous assignments e.g. corresponding to the number of desired responses . When responses from multiple human task performers are obtained they can be used in various ways such as to generate an average of the various results to identify results that are agreed upon by all or by a majority or by a median number etc. In addition in such situations the multiple task performers can be paid in various ways such as to provide the same payment to all task performers who provided results to provide payment only to task performers whose results were determined to be accurate or otherwise used e.g. based on them being in a majority of the results to pay differing amounts to different task performers e.g. based on determined accuracy of the results or promptness of providing the results etc.

After a task performer has completed performance of a task and submitted the results of task performance to the electronic marketplace the results are handled in a manner specified by the task requester. For example in some embodiments such task results for a task may be immediately forwarded to the task requester for the task while in other embodiments the task results may be stored until the task requester retrieves them e.g. after receiving notification from the electronic marketplace of their availability . In addition in some embodiments the task requester may have specified one or more criteria related to evaluating whether the performance results are satisfactory and if so the electronic marketplace system may automatically perform such result verification based on those criteria before providing the results to the task requester. In some embodiments the task requester will further receive additional information related to performance of the task such as information about the identity of the task performer while in other embodiments such additional information may not be available to the task requester.

As previously noted in some embodiments payment to the human task performers will also be triggered by one or more activities related to the performance results such as the supplying of the task results by the task performer or the approval of the task results by the task requester and or automated task verification activities. In addition in some embodiments after task performance results are provided by task performers the task requesters for those tasks may further be queried to provide human generated ratings for the task performers e.g. for use in qualification determinations for those task performers such as related to adequacy and timeliness of the performance results while in other embodiments the electronic marketplace could instead receive any such feedback information from the task requesters even when not explicitly solicited. Similarly in some embodiments task performers may provide rating and other feedback information for task requesters that may be used for qualification determinations for those task requesters whether in response to queries or otherwise such as related to promptness and adequacy of payment sufficiency of the description of the task etc.

In embodiments in which quantitative measurements are made of task performers and or task requesters such as for use as qualifications for those users the electronic marketplace system further performs a variety of types of tracking activities in order to gather information for those quantitative measurements. In particular in some embodiments each activity of a task performer and or task requester relative to a task is recorded and can be used as a quantitative measurement. In addition at least some such tracking information can also be used for other purposes in at least some embodiments such as to determine availability of and load on the electronic marketplace e.g. to determine whether additional computing resources are needed or whether current computing resources are underutilized .

In addition to providing task information to task performers in response to requests the electronic marketplace may in some embodiments provide functionality to automatically match task performers and new tasks as they become available such as for a fee e.g. a fixed amount or a percentage of any payment provided to the task performer if they complete a task for which they are notified . For example if a human task performer has previously supplied qualification information and or preference information regarding tasks of interest e.g. tasks in specified categories having specified key words from specified task requesters from requesters having specified qualifications etc. such as during an initial registration process the electronic marketplace can perform automated matching for new tasks that are submitted in order to determine whether the human task performer satisfies any specified criteria for the task and would desire to be notified of the task. If so the electronic marketplace can notify the task performer in a variety of ways such as based on previously provided preference information regarding how and when they are to be notified. In addition in some embodiments the automated matching may further automatically assign new tasks to appropriate task performers e.g. in accordance with preference information specified by the performers including locking the task assignments if appropriate for the task. In other embodiments task performers may receive similar functionality using third party functionality such as an automated program that obtains information about new tasks from the electronic marketplace e.g. based on polling and performs the automated matching functionality for those new tasks on behalf of one or more of the task performers.

Matching of tasks and task performers may be provided in a variety of ways. For example in some embodiments matching will be performed in a bi directional manner such as when tasks have criteria for task performers and task performers have conditions for tasks e.g. attributes of the task and or of the task requester that submitted the task . In addition a variety of other types of information may similarly be considered when performing matching. For example in some embodiments a match may be time sensitive e.g. based on an urgency of a task and or price sensitive e.g. when the price for performing the task varies over time such as to increase the price over time until a task is performed or to instead decrease the price over time . Similarly in some embodiments a variety of other types of information may be considered such as legal constraints e.g. to enforce a minimum or maximum limit on the number of tasks assigned to a task performer such as for contractual or tax reasons or to restrict performance of tasks in some embodiments and situations to task performers in a certain geographical area due to tax or national security reasons . In addition some types of tasks may be restricted to certain types of task performers such as only new task performers e.g. to assist new task performers who may lack extensive qualifications and or only experienced task performers.

In addition in some embodiments and or for some types of tasks e.g. tasks for which a task requester has requested and or purchased an enhanced or concierge level of service the system may facilitate task performance by attempting to locate a task performer to perform the task in various ways. For example the system may in some embodiments assist task performers to enhance their qualifications such as by recommending to them to acquire new qualifications e.g. based on current and or projected demand for qualifications or based on comparisons to other similar task performers with whom they may be competing for tasks and may further assist the task performers in acquiring the new qualifications in some embodiments e.g. by offering a qualification test to acquire the qualification providing information on how to acquire a qualification from a third party qualification issuer or issuing entity etc. . When an exact match for a task performer is not available the system may also provide additional functionality to assist a task requester such as to identify task performers who are closest to being a match and providing a ranked list based on the closeness of those task performers. The system may similarly rank tasks for task performers e.g. in response to a search such as to identify the tasks that are the closest match and or that possess other attributes of interest e.g. having the highest reward first. In addition the system may in some embodiments attempt to identify external sources of qualification information and import additional qualification information such as to identify a match that was not initially known due to a lack of complete qualification information.

In addition while tasks may in some embodiments have associated categories and or keywords that are supplied by task requesters in other embodiments the electronic marketplace system automatically categorizes tasks and or generates keywords for tasks based on analysis of information about the tasks such as by analyzing similarities in attributes using data mining and other related analyses techniques. In a similar manner in some embodiments the electronic marketplace may organize related task performers and or related task requesters into groups based on similarities in qualifications and other attributes. Such organization and categorization of tasks task performers and or task requesters assists users of the electronic marketplace in identifying tasks and other parties of interest such as other parties with whom to work or with whom to avoid working.

As previously noted in some embodiments each task may be a simple stand alone activity for which a task performer receives a task description and optionally additional information to analyze and provides results of task performance. In other embodiments however some or all of the tasks may instead have multiple stages and or multiple related successive activities by the task performer including having multiple interactions e.g. with the task requester the TFF system and or one or more other executing applications during and or between the stages or successive activities. In such embodiments payment can be provided to a task performer in various ways such as based on completion of all stages activities or instead based on completion of each of one or more intermediate stages activities.

In addition while in some embodiments each of the task performers may be unrelated to and even unknown to other task performers in other embodiments multiple task performers may instead be affiliated or related to each other in various ways such as by being part of a single organization by working together e.g. as a group when performing some or all tasks e.g. to coordinate performance of related tasks and or to share task related knowledge etc. In at least some such embodiments tasks may be submitted by one or more task requesters for performance by a group of multiple task performers e.g. by a specified group by a group that has at least a minimum number of members and or that has at most a maximum number of members by a group that has one or more specified qualifications for the group etc. and or a group of multiple task performers may accept one or more tasks for performance by one or more members of the group even if the task requesters had not specified that those tasks were for performance by a group. In addition when multiple users work together as a group the group may in some embodiments by treated by the TFF system in a manner similar to a single user such as to allow the group to be issued qualifications and or to have various types of associated information as well as to in some embodiments automatically determined aggregate qualifications for a group based on the individual qualifications of group members.

Similarly while in some embodiments each of the task requesters may be unrelated to and even unknown to other task requesters in other embodiments multiple task requesters may instead be affiliated or related to each other in various ways such as by being part of a single organization by working together e.g. as a group for some or all tasks to be performed e.g. to coordinate performance requests for related tasks such as by identifying them as being related and or specifying criteria related to performance of a group of tasks etc. In a related manner in some embodiments groups of tasks may be identified as being related e.g. based on indications received from the task requesters for the tasks such as to coordinate performance of the tasks in the group in various ways e.g. by collecting or aggregating performance results for all of the tasks by assigning them to one or more task performers in a manner to facilitate the coordination of the performance etc. . In addition in some embodiments task requesters and or task performers may be recruited for participation in the system in a variety of ways including on the basis of existing group membership or other affinity information e.g. to identify people likely to have time to work as task performers such as based on their status as being potentially retired due to their membership in a seniors oriented group .

In some embodiments additional security mechanisms are further employed to restrict access to at least some information for at least some users. For example some information about tasks may not be made available to at least some task performers such as to hide information about the existence of tasks or about certain task details from task performers who are not qualified to perform the task to whom the task is not assigned or who otherwise meet criteria specified by a task requester. Furthermore some information about a task may be made available to a potential task performer only when certain conditions are satisfied such as completion of a non disclosure agreement or satisfaction of other specified criteria. Similarly at least some information about the task requesters and or task performers may be hidden from at least some other task performers and or task requesters such as to shield identities of users e.g. to provide partial or total anonymity between a task requester who submits a task and a task performer who performs the task or to limit information about a task performer or task requester to potential competitors or to limit access to information about quantitative measurements or other qualifications in order to minimize attempts by participants in the marketplace to artificial manipulate rankings and other qualification information. In particular in some embodiments at least some qualifications of task performers may be private to the task performers and or to task requesters who issued those qualifications to those task performers such as to allow the task requesters to limit performance of their tasks to task performers in a manner that is not visible to other task performers who do not have those qualifications.

In some embodiments the system further attempts to provide meta information about other information in the system e.g. results of task performance appropriateness of a user s qualification appropriateness of corroboration of a user s qualification etc. such as to provide a confidence value to a task requester regarding a likely appropriateness e.g. accuracy reliability reproducibility etc. of results of task performance to provide a confidence value to a user regarding a likely appropriateness e.g. accuracy reliability reproducibility etc. of a qualification of a user e.g. of a rating value for the user for the qualification to provide a confidence value to a user regarding a likely appropriateness e.g. accuracy reliability reproducibility etc. of corroboration of a qualification of a user etc. Such confidence values may be generated or otherwise determined in various ways for task results such as based on information obtained from other task performers than those who provided the results e.g. by having multiple task performers perform a task and comparing the results by having more qualified task performers review the initially obtained task results etc. on comparison of the results to other results received for similar or related tasks on automatically verifying whether the results satisfy criteria specified for the task etc. Such confidence values may be generated or otherwise determined in various ways for users qualifications and for corroboration of users qualifications including based on information provided by or otherwise associated with those users and or based on information provided by or otherwise associated with other users.

In some embodiments the system further assists task requesters to obtain useful results in various ways such as by providing insurance to recoup payments made for results that are not received or that turn out to be unsatisfactory by providing an escrow service in which payments are held until they can be verified as satisfactory by providing for appropriate contractual terms e.g. binding arbitration or other mechanisms to resolve disputes etc. Some or all of these functionalities may be provided for a fee in some embodiments such as a fee charged to the task requesters and or to the task performers involved in a transaction benefiting from the functionality provided. In addition in some embodiments the system attempts to improve its performance over time by learning preferences of task requesters and or task performers such as by monitoring their activities and or gathering feedback from them regarding prior activities.

The system and or the described techniques can also be used in other manners in some embodiments. As previously noted the system may export various information in some embodiments for use by other systems such as user qualification information and other types of user information. In addition use of qualification information may be used for purposes of dating or other social or business networking in some embodiments such as by submitting tasks having qualification criteria intended to match users whose qualifications satisfy the qualification criteria in this example the task may be performed by identifying the one or more task performers who satisfy the task s associated qualifications or other criteria. In a similar manner users matching specified criteria could similarly be found for other purposes in other embodiments such as to identify appropriate users for a research study polling opinion taking surveys etc.

As previously noted in some embodiments the TFF system assists in managing at least some types of interactions with users such as to allow task requesters and or task performers to specify how certain types of task related interactions are to occur. In particular in some embodiments task requesters are allowed to specify how interactions are to occur with task performers who are performing their tasks and in particular to specify one or more task interaction control TIC types for each of their submitted tasks. In at least some such embodiments each TIC type is associated with a distinct combination of multiple types of processing to be performed when presenting task related information to a task performer and or when obtaining results of the task performance from the task performer. When the TFF system interacts with a task performer to manage the performance of a task having a specified TIC type the TFF system implements the combination of processing types for the specified TIC type to control those interactions.

In some embodiments at least four types of user interaction processing may be specified for each TIC type including a specified manner of manipulating information associated with a task before it is provided to a task performer e.g. to prepare the information to be presented to the task performer a specified manner of providing the manipulated information to the task performer e.g. to control the presentation of the manipulated task information to the task performer a specified manner of receiving or otherwise obtaining results of task performance from the task performer e.g. to control how the task results are specified by and sent by the task performer and a specified manner of manipulating obtained task results before they are provided to the task requester e.g. to prepare the information to be presented or otherwise provided to the task requester . In this manner each of the types of user interaction processing may be specified independently of the others such as to transmit task information to a task performer using a first data format and or first transmission protocol and to receive task results from the task performer using a distinct second data format and or distinct second transmission protocol and or to have task information specified in a first format and to have task results specified in a different format.

In addition in at least some embodiments each specified manner of performing one of the types of user interaction processing may be implemented by a component containing executable information to implement that specified manner of processing. For example each specified manner of manipulating task information before it is provided to a task performer may be implemented by an appropriate task information manipulation component each specified manner of sending manipulated task information to a task performer may be implemented by an appropriate task information provider component each specified manner of receiving task results from a task performer may be implemented by an appropriate task results receiver component and each specified manner of manipulating received task results may be implemented by an appropriate task results manipulation component.

Some illustrative examples of the user interaction processing type of manipulating task information before it is provided to a task performer include the following using XSLT eXtensible Style Language Transformation to transform task data in XML format to HTML HyperText Markup Language format e.g. for display to the task performer as a Web page formatted in a specific manner or to another format e.g. a different XML format wrapping task data that is in a format presentable on the task performer s computing device e.g. in Flash format to be presented by a Macromedia player on the task performer s computing device or included as part of a Java applet executable on the task performer s computing device in another format e.g. HTML for transmission to the task performer encrypting the task information before it is sent to the task performer e.g. in a manner so that it can be decrypted by the computing device of the task performer modifying the form of the task information e.g. to convert XML based data to a chart graph table for presentation manipulating the content of the task information e.g. to transform text in one language to another whether in addition to or instead of manipulating the information format and acting as a pass through mechanism that does not modify the task information. The task information to be manipulated can also take a variety of forms including text numerical data one or more images video data audio information etc.

Some illustrative examples of the user interaction processing type of providing task information to the task performer include the following sending a Web page or other document type to the task performer for display or other presentation by a Web browser or other appropriate application program on a computing device of the task performer e.g. using HTTP WAP or Wireless Application Protocol SSL or Secure Sockets Layer Secure HTTP etc. and sending executable code e.g. a Java applet to the computing device of the task performer in a manner to invoke an appropriate environment to execute the code e.g. using JNLP or Java Network Launching Protocol to execute a Java applet . In some embodiments the user interaction processing type of providing task information to the task performer may include selecting a protocol to be used in sending the task information and or may include causing a particular type of application on the task performer s computing device to receive and handle the task information e.g. by causing that program to be invoked .

Some illustrative examples of the user interaction processing type of obtaining results of task performance from the task performer include the following receiving the task results via a provided Web service based interface that a program on the task performer s computing device invokes to send the task results receiving the task results as CGI data e.g. via HTTP GET and or POST commands such as from a form on a Web page displayed to the task performer and receiving task results sent from an executing program on the task performer s computing device e.g. a program invoked using a specified user interaction processing type of providing task information to the task performer such as using a variety of communication techniques e.g. CORBA RPC Java RMI or Remote Method Invocation by using ReST or REpresentational State Transfer to send XML data over HTTP etc. .

Some illustrative examples of the user interaction processing type of manipulating obtained task results before they are provided to the task requester may include processing similar to that of manipulating task information before it is provided to a task performer. In addition the manipulating of obtained task results before they are provided to the task requester may include the following using XSD XML Schema Definition or DTD Document Type Definition to convert task results data in CGI form to XML form decrypting task results that were encrypted at the computing device of the task performer modifying the form of or manipulating the content of the task results in various ways and acting as a pass through mechanism that does not modify the task results.

In some embodiments multiple alternatives are provided by the TFF system for each of the types of user interaction processing such as by implementing each alternative as a distinct component. Thus for example the alternatives for the manipulation of task information processing type may each be implemented by a corresponding task information manipulation component and may include one or more distinct components that each have XSLT instructions for transforming data in XML format in a specified manner a component including executable information to wrap task data in Flash format in an HTML wrapper and a pass through component that provides as output the same task information that it receives as input. Similar alternatives may be provided by the TFF system for each of the user interaction processing types.

In addition in some embodiments the TFF system provides one or more predefined TIC types that are each associated with a distinct combination of components that includes at least one component of each of the user interaction processing types. In this manner a task requester may specify a TIC type for a task being submitted by selecting one of the predefined TIC types. In addition in some embodiments a task requester may specify multiple TIC types for a task e.g. with the TIC types using differing types of processing for providing manipulated task information to a task performer such as to allow task performers with computing devices having a greater variability of capabilities to perform the task. In addition in some embodiments the TFF system may further facilitate the performance of a task by automatically selecting one of multiple specified TIC types for a task for use by a task performer such as based on known or identifiable capabilities of the computing device of the task performer.

In addition to selecting predefined TIC types the TFF system in some embodiments further allows users to define their own TIC types such as for their own use and or the user of other users. In some embodiments the TIC type definition may include the user selecting a predefined component for each of the user interaction processing types while in other embodiments a user may further be allowed to supply his her own components for each of one or more of the user interaction processing types e.g. components designed to handle data that is formatted in a manner specific to a task type created by the user . In addition in some embodiments the user supplied components may perform the user interaction processing in different manners than those of predefined alternatives e.g. a user supplied component that combines the processing of two or more of the user interaction processing types such as to both send task information to a task performer and receive task results information from the task performer and or may perform various additional types of processing. Moreover while in some embodiments the selected components for a TIC type interoperate in a predefined serial manner with the task information manipulation component receiving the raw task data and sending the manipulated task information to the task information providing component and with the task results obtaining component receiving the raw task results and sending them to the task results manipulation component in other embodiments a user may be allowed to specify additional logic or relationships to define how the components interoperate. In addition in some embodiments the selection of a component may depend on the components used before and or after the component being selected and thus the types of components made available to a user defining a new TIC type may vary based on selections already made and or information specific to the task.

For illustrative purposes some embodiments are described below in which specific types of user interactions are managed in specific ways including by using various specific types of task information processing information in specific ways. However those skilled in the art will appreciate that the techniques of the invention can be used in a wide variety of other situations including with other types of task information processing and to manage other types of user interactions and that the invention is not limited to the exemplary details provided.

After the HTML output file is sent to a computing device of the task performer e.g. by a manipulated task information provider processing component not shown that sends the data using the HTTP protocol such as based on the manipulated task information provider processing type being specified for the TIC type associated with the task illustrates the display of the HTML output file to the task presenter as a Web page such as on a Web browser on the computing device of the task performer. In this example the displayed Web page shows a question posed to the task performer with multiple user selectable image choices displayed as possible answers to the question. In particular in this example each of the choices includes a displayed image and a user selectable radio button control that the task performer can select. After the selection is made which in this example is of Image the task performer clicks on the Submit button at the bottom of the screen to cause the results of the task performance to be sent back to the TFF system.

After the task results information is received at the TFF system e.g. by a processing component not shown that obtains task results by receiving CGI data from the task performer such as based on the task results obtainer processing type being specified for the TIC type associated with the task illustrates an example of task results manipulation processing type information for use in preparing the task results to be provided to the task requester that submitted the task such as based on that task results manipulation processing type being specified for the TIC type associated with the task. In particular in this example the processing information is implemented as another XSLT file component that can be used to convert the task results from the task performer to XML format so that they can be programmatically provided to the task requester. For example line shows that the output of the XSLT file will be xml data line specifies that CGIData is to be matched in the results information and lines specify that the value of the value parameter for the selected image is to be written to the output XML file as the desired data. then illustrates the output XML file that results from the operation of the task results manipulation processing with line showing that the answer selected by the task performer was labeled Image4 .

In the illustrated embodiment the Task Submission Receiver module receives submissions of tasks from task requesters and associates one or more TIC types with each of the submitted tasks such as based on a specification of the TIC type for a task by the task requester submitting the task. In situations in which the task requester submits one or more tasks in an interactive manner the Task Submission Receiver module may assist the identification of an appropriate TIC type by providing options for the TIC type to the task requester such as based on the type of task s and or information associated with the task requester. The TIC type options may include predefined TIC types and or TIC types previously defined by the task requester and in some embodiments the Task Submission Receiver may further allow a task requester to define a new TIC type for use with a task being submitted such as based on interactions with the TIC Type Definer module. In other embodiments the association of one or more TIC types with a task may instead be performed at times other than task submission such as after the submission. After tasks are submitted and associated with one or more TIC types information about the associated TIC types is included with the other information about the task in the database . During performance of the task at least one of the associated TIC types will be used to control the task performance and the associated TIC types may further be used in some embodiments to assist in initially selecting appropriate task performers for the task e.g. based on those task performers having capabilities to receive task information and provide task results in a manner consistent with the processing types specified for the associated TIC types .

The Task Interaction Controller module in the illustrated embodiment controls the performance of tasks based on the TIC types associated with the tasks. In particular when a task is to be performed by a task performer the Task Interaction Controller module selects one of the TIC types associated with the task and uses the types of information processing specified for the TIC type to control the task performance. In the illustrated embodiment definitions of predefined system provided TIC types if any are included in the database and definitions of user defined TIC types if any are included in the database . Each of the TIC type definitions specify multiple processing types to be used with the TIC type and in some embodiments may specify logic or parameters to control how the multiple processing types interoperate. In some embodiments each of the processing types is associated with an associated component or other grouping of processing information with predefined system provided components if any stored in the illustrated embodiment in database and user defined components if any stored in the illustrated embodiment in database . Thus to control performance of a task based on an associated TIC type the Task Interaction Controller module retrieves the TIC type definition from databases or retrieves the components specified in the TIC type definition from databases and or and executes those components in an appropriate manner to control the task performance. An appropriate TIC type associated with a task can be selected by the Task Interaction Controller module can be selected for use in various ways such as based on the selected TIC type being the only TIC type associated with the task on the selected TIC type being specified by the task performer on the selected TIC type being preferred or needed for use with the computing device of the task performer based on the device s capabilities etc.

The TIC Type Definer module in the illustrated embodiment allows users e.g. task requesters to define new TIC types for use in controlling tasks to be submitted and may further in some embodiments allow users to supply or otherwise define new components for use with a TIC type being defined e.g. to process information specified in a format and or task type specific to a task requester or to provide additional capabilities such as to encrypt and decrypt information sent to and received from a task performer in a specified manner . In other embodiments users may not be allowed to define their own TIC types and thus the TIC Type Definer module may not be present in those embodiments. The TIC type definition may be performed in various ways such as by successively displaying or otherwise providing to a user each of the available alternatives for each of a series of types of information processing such as based on predefined system provided components. In embodiments and situations in which dependencies exist between different components or processing types the module may further limit the provided alternatives based on the prior selections. After a new TIC type is defined the module stores the definition in the database and further stores any user supplied components in the database .

In other embodiments some of the types of illustrated functionality and or information may not be provided and other types of information and or functionality may be available. In addition the illustrated functionality may be combined in more or fewer modules and the illustrated types of information may be stored in other manners.

The routine begins at step where an indication is received from a task requester to submit one or more new tasks. The routine determines in step whether to use one or more existing TIC types e.g. predefined system provided TIC types such as based on an indication received from the task requester and if so continues to step to determine available TIC types. Available TIC types may be determined in various ways such as based on all defined TIC types TIC types determined to be appropriate for the task and or the user submitting the task etc. The routine then continues to step to provide the determined TIC types to the task requester and in step obtains a selection from the task requester of one or more of the TIC types. If it was instead determined in step not to use an existing TIC type the routine continues instead to execute the TIC Type Definer routine in step to define one or more new TIC types and in step selects the newly defined TIC type s for use with the task being submitted.

After steps or the routine continues to step to associate the selected TIC type s with the task s being submitted and continues to step to make the tasks available for performance e.g. by storing information about the tasks in an available tasks database . The routine then continues to step to determine whether to continue. If so the routine returns to step and if not the routine continues to step and ends.

The routine begins at step where an indication is received from a user e.g. a task requester to define a new TIC type. The routine continues to step to identify the processing types to be used for the TIC type being defined such as based on a default set of processing types used for all TIC types or instead in another manner. The routine then continues to step to select the next information processing type to be specified for the new TIC type being defined beginning with the first. In step the routine then determines available alternatives for the selected information processing type such as all alternatives or instead in a manner based on other information from the new TIC type e.g. other alternatives already selected the user defining the new TIC type etc. . The routine then continues to step to present the available alternatives to the task requester along with an option to instead supply a new alternative implementation although in other embodiments such user supplied alternatives may not be used or may be specified by the task requester at other times or in other manners.

The routine then continues to step to receive a selection from the task requester and in step determines whether the task requester selected one of the previously available alternatives. If not the routine continues to step to obtain an alternative implementation from the task requester e.g. by receiving a component with executable information to implement the alternative and selects it for use with the new TIC type being defined and in step stores the obtained alternative for later user. After step or if it was instead determined in step that the task requester selected an existing alternative the routine continues to step to store an indication of the selected alternative as being specified for the new TIC type. The routine then determines in step whether there are more information processing types to specify for the new TIC type and if so returns to step to select the new information processing type to specify. If not the routine stores a definition of the new TIC type for later use and then continues to step to optionally specify any received additional information for the new TIC type e.g. information about the conditions under which the TIC type may be used and who may use it . While not illustrated here the routine may in some embodiments also return an indication to the task requester for the new defined TIC type such as a unique identifier for later use in referencing the new TIC type. The routine then determines in step whether to continue. If so the routine returns to step and if not continues to step and ends.

The routine begins at step where an indication is received of a task to be performed by a task performer such as based on a request by the task performer. The routine continues to step to retrieve task information for the task and in step determines a TIC type for use in controlling performance of the task such as based on an association of the TIC type with the task and or a selection of the TIC type by the task performer. The routine then continues to step to determine multiple task information processing types specified for the determined TIC type in the illustrated embodiment each TIC type specifies a component or other group of processing information for each of four task information processing types although in other embodiments other numbers or types of processing types may instead be used.

In steps the routine then performs each of the types of processing specified for the determined TIC type. In step the routine manipulates the retrieved task information in a specified manner based on a specified task information manipulation processing type for the TIC type and in step the routine provides the manipulated task information to the task performer in a specified manner based on a specified task information providing processing type for the TIC type. After the task performer performs the task the routine receives the results of the task performance in a specified manner in step based on a specified task results receiver processing type for the TIC type and in step manipulates the received task results in a specified manner based on a task results manipulation processing type for the TIC type. While the illustrated embodiment indicates a synchronous flow in which the routine waits for and obtains task results after sending the task information in other embodiments the routine could be structured in other manners such as to continue with other processing while waiting for task results if any to be sent. In addition in some situations task performers may not provide task results for a task after they accept an assignment to perform the task which may be indicated to the routine in an explicit message from the task performer to withdraw from task performance or instead by not receiving task results within a specified period of time and if so the routine would continue to handle other task related requests and information.

After step the routine continues to step to provide the manipulated task results to the task requester in a specified manner although in other embodiments the task results may instead be stored until the task requester proactively retrieves them. After step the routine continues to step to determine whether to continue. If so the routine returns to step and if not continues to step and ends.

While the use of TIC types and associated use of various types of information processing have been described in conjunction with the TFF system those skilled in the art will appreciate that these techniques may similarly be used in variety of other situations including in other types of systems in which questions are provided and answers are gathered or more generally in which information is provided and received.
