This invention was made with U.S. Government support from Office of Naval Research No. N000140210185 and STC program of the National Science Foundation under Agreement No. CHE 9876674. The U.S. Government has certain rights in the invention.

Generally the present invention relates to materials and methods for fabricating polymeric devices. More particularly the polymeric devices can be multi layered devices such as microfluidic devices.

Microfluidic devices developed in the early 1990s were fabricated from hard materials such as silicon and glass using photolithography and etching techniques. See Ouellette J. 2003 Aug. Sep. 14 17 Scherer A. et al. 2000 290 1536 1539. Photolithography and etching techniques however are costly and labor intensive require clean room conditions and pose several disadvantages from a materials standpoint. For these reasons soft materials have emerged as alternative materials for microfluidic device fabrication. The use of soft materials has made possible the manufacture and actuation of devices containing valves pumps and mixers. See e.g. Ouellette J. 2003 Aug. Sep. 14 17 Scherer A. et al. 2000 290 1536 1539 Unger M. A. et al. 2000 288 113 116 McDonald J. C. et al. 2002 35 491 499 and Thorsen T. et al. 2002 298 580 584. For example one such microfluidic device allows for control over flow direction without the use of mechanical valves. See Zhao B. et al. 2001 291 1023 1026.

The increasing complexity of microfluidic devices has created a demand to use such devices in a rapidly growing number of applications. To this end the use of soft materials has allowed microfluidics to develop into a useful technology that has found application in genome mapping rapid separations sensors nanoscale reactions ink jet printing drug delivery Lab on a Chip in vitro diagnostics injection nozzles biological studies and drug screening. See e.g. Ouellette J. 2003 Aug. Sep. 14 17 Scherer A. et al. 2000 290 1536 1539 Unger M. A. et al. 2000 288 113 116 McDonald J. C. et al. 2002 35 491 499 Thorsen T. et al. 2002 298 580 584 and Liu J. et al. 2003 75 4718 4723.

Poly dimethylsiloxane PDMS is the soft material of choice for many microfluidic device applications. See Scherer A. et al. 2000 290 1536 1539 Unger M. A. et al. 2000 288 113 116 McDonald J. C. et al. 2002 35 491 499 Thorsen T. et al. 2002 298 580 584 and Liu J. et al. 2003 75 4718 4723. A PDMS material offers numerous attractive properties in microfluidic applications. Upon cross linking PDMS becomes an elastomeric material with a low Young s modulus e.g. approximately 750 kPa. See Unger M. A. et al. 2000 288 113 116. This property allows PDMS to conform to surfaces and to form reversible seals. Further PDMS has a low surface energy e.g. approximately 20 erg cm which can facilitate its release from molds after patterning. See Scherer A. et al. 2000 290 1536 1539 McDonald J. C. et al. 2002 35 491 499.

Another important feature of PDMS is its outstanding gas permeability. This property allows gas bubbles within the channels of a microfluidic device to permeate out of the device. This property also is useful in sustaining cells and microorganisms inside the features of the microfluidic device. The nontoxic nature of silicones such as PDMS also is beneficial in this respect and allows for opportunities in the realm of medical implants. McDonald J. C. et al. 2002 35 491 499.

Many current PDMS microfluidic devices are based on SYLGARD 184 Dow Corning Midland Mich. United States of America . SYLGARD 184 is cured thermally through a platinum catalyzed hydrosilation reaction. Complete curing of SYLGARD 184 can take as long as five hours. The synthesis of a photocurable PDMS material however with mechanical properties similar to that of SYLGARD 184 for use in soft lithography recently has been reported. See Choi K. M. et al. 2003 125 4060 4061.

Despite the aforementioned advantages PDMS suffers from multiple drawbacks in microfluidic applications. First PDMS swells in most organic solvents. Thus PDMS based microfluidic devices have a limited compatibility with various organic solvents. See Lee J. N. et al. 2003 75 6544 6554. Among those organic solvents that swell PDMS are hexanes ethyl ether toluene dichloromethane acetone and acetonitrile. See Lee J. N. et al. 2003 75 6544 6554. The swelling of a PDMS microfluidic device by organic solvents can disrupt its micron scale features e.g. a channel or plurality of channels and can restrict or completely shut off the flow of organic solvents through the channels. Thus microfluidic applications with a PDMS based device are limited to the use of fluids such as water that do not swell PDMS. As a result those applications that require the use of organic solvents likely will need to use microfluidic systems fabricated from hard materials such as glass and silicon. See Lee J. N. et al. 2003 75 6544 6554. This approach however is limited by the disadvantages of fabricating microfluidic devices from hard materials.

Second PDMS based devices and materials are notorious for not being adequately inert to be used even in aqueous based chemistries. For example PDMS is susceptible to reaction with weak and strong acids and bases. PDMS based devices also are notorious for containing extractables such as extractable oligomers and cyclic siloxanes especially after exposure to acids and bases. Because PDMS is easily swollen by organics hydrophobic materials even those hydrophobic materials that are slightly soluble in water can partition during use into PDMS based materials used to construct PDMS based microfluidic devices.

Thus an elastomeric material that exhibits the attractive mechanical properties of PDMS combined with a resistance to swelling in common organic solvents would extend the use of microfluidic devices to a variety of new chemical applications that are inaccessible by current PDMS based devices. Accordingly the approach demonstrated by the presently disclosed subject matter uses an elastomeric material more particularly a functional perfluoropolyether PFPE material which is resistant to swelling in common organic solvents to fabricate a microfluidic device.

Functional PFPE materials are liquids at room temperature exhibit low surface energy low modulus high gas permeability and low toxicity with the added feature of being extremely chemically resistant. See Scheirs John Wiley Sons Ltd. New York 1997 pp 435 485. Further PFPE materials exhibit hydrophobic and lyophobic properties. For this reason PFPE materials are often used as lubricants on high performance machinery operating in harsh conditions. The synthesis and solubility of PFPE materials in supercritical carbon dioxide has been reported. See Bunyard W. et al. 1999 32 8224 8226. Beyond PFPEs fluoroelastomers also can include fluoroolefin based materials including but not limited to copolymers of tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene vinylidene fluoride and alkyl vinyl ethers often with additional cure site monomers added for crosslinking.

A PFPE microfluidic device has been previously reported by Rolland J. et al. 2004 126 2322 2323. The device was fabricated from a functionalized PFPE material e.g. a PFPE dimethacrylate MW 4 000 g mol having a viscosity of the functionalized material of approximately 800 cSt. This material was end functionalized with a free radically polymerizable methacrylate group and UV photocured free radically with a photoinitiator. In Rolland J. et al. supra multilayer PFPE devices were generated using a specific partial UV curing technique however the adhesion was weak and generally not strong enough for a wide range of microfluidic applications. Further the adhesion technique described by Rolland J. et al. did not provide for adhesion to other substrates such as glass.

The presently disclosed subject matter describes the use of fluoroelastomers especially a functional perfluoropolyether as a material for fabricating a solvent resistant micro and nano scale structures such as a microfluidic device. The use of fluoroelastomers and functional perfluoropolyethers in particular as materials for fabricating a microfluidic device addresses the problems associated with swelling in organic solvents exhibited by microfluidic devices made from other polymeric materials such as PDMS. Accordingly PFPE based microfluidic devices can be used in conjunction with chemical reactions that are not amenable to other polymeric microfluidic devices.

Further adequate adhesion between the layers of a multilayer microfluidic device can impact performance in most if not all applications. For example adhesion can impact performance in microfluidic devices such as those described by Unger et al. 288 113 6 2000 which contain multiple layers allowing for the formation of pneumatic valves. Thus there is a need in the art for improved methods for adhering the layers of a microfluidic device together or to other surfaces.

Furthermore many devices such as surgical instruments medical devices prosthetic implants contact lenses and the like are formed from polymeric materials. Polymeric materials commonly used in the medical device industry include but are not limited to polyurethanes polyolefins e.g. polyethylene and polypropylene poly meth acrylates polyesters e.g. polyethyleneterephthalate polyamides polyvinyl resins silicone resins e.g. silicone rubbers and polysiloxanes polycarbonates polyfluorocarbon resins synthetic resins polystyrene various bioerodible materials and the like. Although these and other materials commonly used as implant materials have proven to be useful there are many drawbacks with the materials. One drawback is that with any implant there is always the chance of bio fouling on the surface of the implant. Bio fouling can occur due to the tissue implant interface gap and the surface characteristics of the implant material. Accordingly a need exists for improving the polymeric materials and or functionalizing the materials or the surface of the medical device materials to generate a better tissue device interface and reduce bio fouling.

Then the photocured or thermal cured first device can be adhered to a second device of the same material or any material similar thereto that will thermally cure or photocure and bind to the material of the first device. By positioning the first device and second device adjacent one another and subjecting the first and second devices to a thermal curing or photocuring whichever component that was not activated on the first curing.

In some embodiments useful click chemistry reactions include cycloaddition reactions of unsaturated compounds including 1 3 dipolar additions and Diels Alder reactions nucleophilic substitution reactions especially those involving ring opening of small strained rings like epoxides and aziridines addition reactions to carbon carbon multiple bonds and reactions involving non aldol carbonyl chemistry such as the formation of ureas and amides.

In some embodiments the materials described herein are used in only a part of a fabricated microfluidic device. In such devices portions of the device are made from the materials disclosed herein and other portions of the device are made from other materials described herein such as glass or PDMS. Examples of such parts include but are not limited to valves channels walls discs layers backing plugs balls switches gears and pillars.

In some embodiments master template can be generated from a silicon substance a photoresist substance combinations thereof or the like. Next a liquid PFPE precursor is introduced to master template and or its pattern as shown in steps B C. In some embodiments liquid PFPE can be introduced onto master template by casting deposition spin coating pressing pouring combinations thereof or the like. Liquid PFPE is then cured while in contact with master template to form solidified liquid PFPE that can retain pattern of master template when removed from master template . In some embodiments liquid PFPE is cured as described herein such as for example by photo curing thermal curing evaporation curing combinations thereof and the like. Solidified liquid PFPE is then removed from master template as shown in step C. Solidified liquid PFPE can then be used as a template for patterning a PDMS layer as shown in steps D F. Liquid PDMS is brought into contact with solidified liquid PFPE and cured forming solidified liquid PDMS as shown in steps E F. Liquid PDMS can include curing agents as described herein and can be cured by methods and techniques described herein such as for example photo activation of photo curing agents thermal activation of thermal curing agents evaporation curing combinations thereof and the like. Solidified liquid PDMS is then removed from solidified liquid PFPE template as shown in step F. Finally solidified liquid PDMS can be used as a template to mold subsequent PFPE devices by introducing a second quantity of liquid PFPE to solidified liquid PDMS template and curing liquid PFPE as shown in steps G H. Liquid PFPE can include curing agents as described herein and can be cured by methods and techniques described herein to form PFPE device . PFPE device can then be removed from solidified liquid PDMS template . The use of liquid PDMS as a template for fabrication of PFPE device allows for easier release of PFPE device from the PDMS template than release from a silicon or photoresist template. Use of a PDMS template such as described herein if further advantageous over a silicon or photoresist template when the silicon or photoresist template contains latent functionalities which can react with the endgroups on the PFPE precursors thereby causing adhesion of the PFPE device to the silicon or photoresist template.

In some embodiments a layer of materials described herein can be treated with an acid and or base such that any latent functionalities associated with a surface of the material can be neutralized. Neutralizing such latent functionalities reduces interactions with substances that come into contact with the material during use. According to some embodiments the surface of the material treated is the surface of a channel formed within the material such as for example a channel of a microfluidic device. According to some embodiments F is a preferable surface treatment however other treatments can also be utilized and may be more appropriate for the compositions of the material to be treated.

Many reactions involving F as a nucleophile are quenched by trace amounts of metal catalysts specifically organo tin catalysts such as dibutyltin diacetate dibutyltin dilaurate and stannous octoate. Further it is generally known that metal catalysts or metal complexes will form strong complexes with F . For example metal complexes containing Ru Rh Pd Pt Cu Co Ni Fe Cr Sn Al and Si are known to form strong associations with F . An example of such a reaction is shown below for the synthesis of 2 deoxy 2 F fluoro D glucose FDG an imaging agent used in positron emission tomography PET .

In some embodiments the epoxy functional polymer has a Tg at or above room temperature and is spin coated onto a surface such as glass silicon a flat or cured layer of PFPE material combinations thereof or the like. Layers of a device can then be sealed to the polymer layer and irradiated with UV light. The UV light activates the PAG within the epoxy functional polymer causing it to crosslink as well as react with latent groups on the surface of the PFPE layer thus adhering the PFPE layer to the surface. In some embodiments the epoxy functional polymer consists of SU 8 photoresist polymers containing the following structure combinations thereof or the like

The different electrophoretic techniques can be used in series with or without a labeling step to help with quantitation and in conjunction with a variety of elution techniques such as hydrodynamic salt mobilization pH mobilization or electroosmotic flow to further separate proteins. A variety of other materials have been used to aid in separation processes in microfluidic devices. Such materials can be attached to channel walls in a device or be present as a separate matrix inside a channel see U.S. Pat. No. 6 581 441 to Paul U.S. Pat. No. 6 613 581 to Wada et al. . Parallel separation channels can exist to separate many samples at the same time. The solid separation media can be present as a discrete particle or as a porous monolithic solid. Possible materials include silica gel agarose based gels polyacrylamide gels a colloidal solution such as a gelatin starches non ionic macroreticular and macroporous resins such as AMBERCHROM Rohm and Haas Co Philadelphia Pa.

Microfluidic devices as sensors have garnered attention in the last few years. Such microfluidic sensors can include dye based detection systems affinity based detections systems microfabricated gravimetric analyzers CCD cameras optical detectors optical microscopy systems electrical systems thermocouples thermoresistors and pressure sensors. Such devices have been used to detect biomolecules see Published PCT International Application No. WO 2004 094 986 to Althaus et al. including polynucleotides proteins and viruses through their interaction with probe molecules capable of providing an electrochemical signal. For example intercalation of a nucleic acid sample with a probe molecule such as doxorubicin can reduce the amount of free doxorubicin in contact with an electrode and a change in electrical signal results. Devices have been described that contain sensors for detecting and controlling environmental factors inside device reaction chambers such as humidity pH dissolved Oand dissolved CO see Published PCT International Application No. WO 2004 069 983 to Rodgers et al. . Such devices have particular use in growing and maintaining cells. The carbon content of samples can be measured in a device see U.S. Pat. No. 6 444 474 to Thomas et al. wherein UV irradiation oxidizes organics to CO which is then quantitated by conductivity measurements or infrared methods. Capacitance sensors used in microfluidic devices see Published PCT International Application No. WO 2004 085 063 to Xie et al. can be used to measure pressure flow fluid levels and ion concentrations.

Another application for microfluidic systems includes the high throughput injection of cells see Published PCT International Application No. WO 00 20554 to Garman et al. In such a device cells are impelled to a needle where they can be injected with a wide variety of materials including molecules and macromolecules genes chromosomes or organelles.

No. 6 498 353 to Nagle et al. .

The presently disclosed materials and methods also can be applied to the design and manufacture of devices to be used in the manner of microtiter plates. Microtiter plates have a variety of uses in the fields of high throughput screening for proteomics genomics and drug discovery environmental chemistry assays parallel synthesis cell culture molecular biology and immunoassays. Common base materials used for microtiter plates include hydrophobic materials such as polystyrene and polypropylene and hydrophilic materials such as glass. Silicon metal polyester polyolefin and polytetrafluoroethylene surfaces also have been used for microtiter plates.

Surfaces can be selected for a particular application based on their solvent and temperature compatibilities and for their ability or lack of ability to interact with the molecules or biomolecules being assayed or otherwise manipulated. Chemical modification of the base material is often useful in tailoring the microtiter plate to its desired function either by modifying the surface characteristics or by providing a site for the covalent attachment of a molecule or biomolecule. The functionalizable nature of the presently disclosed materials is well suited for these purposes.

Some applications call for surfaces with low binding characteristics. Proteins and many other biomolecules such as eukaryotic and microbial cells can passively adsorb to polystyrene through hydrophobic or ionic interactions. Some surface modified base materials have been developed to address this problem. CORNING Ultra Low Attachment Corning Incorporated Life Sciences Acton Mass. United States of America is a hydrogel coated polystyrene. The hydrogel coating renders the surface neutral and hydrophilic preventing the attachment of almost all cells. Vessels made from the surface have uses in preventing serum protein absorption in preventing anchorage dependent cells MDCK VERO C6 and the like from dividing in selectively culturing tumor or virally transformed cells as unattached colonies in preventing stem cells from attachment mediated differentiation and in studying the activation and inactivation mechanisms of macrophages. NUNC MINISORP Nalgene Nunc International Naperville Ill. United States of America is polyethylene based product with low protein affinity and has uses for DNA probe and serum based assays where non specific binding is a problem.

For other applications base materials have been modified to enhance their ability to adhere to cells and other biomolecules. NUNCLON Nalgene Nunc International is a polystyrene surface treated by corona or plasma discharge to add surface carboxyl groups rendering the material hydrophilic and negatively charged. The material has been used in the cell culture of a variety of cells. Polyolefin and polyester materials also have been treated to enhance their hydrophilicity and thereby become good surfaces for the adhesion and growth of cells for example PERMANOX and THERMANOX also from Nalgene Nunc International . Base materials can be coated with poly D lysine collagen or fibronectin to create a positively charged surface which also can enhance cell attachment growth and differentiation.

Further other molecules can be absorbed to a microtiter like plate. Nunc MAXISORP Nalgene Nunc is a modified polystyrene base that has a high affinity for polar molecules and is recommended for surfaces where antibodies need to be absorbed to the surface as in the case of many ELISA assays. Surfaces also can be modified to interact with analytes in a more specific manner. Examples of such functional modifications include nickel chelate modified surfaces for the quantification and detection of histidine tagged fusion proteins and glutathione modified surfaces for the capture of GST tagged fusion proteins. Streptavidin coated surfaces can be used when working with biotinylated proteins.

Some modified surfaces provide sites for the covalent attachment of various molecules or biomolecules. COVALINK NH Secondary Amine surface Nalgene Nunc International is a polystyrene surface covered with secondary amines which can bind proteins and peptides through their carboxyl groups via carbodimide chemistry or bind DNA through the formation of a 5 phosphoramidiate bond again using carbodimide chemistry . Other molecules carbohydrates hormones small molecules and the like containing or modified to contain carboxylate groups also can be bound to the surface. Epoxide is another useful moiety for covalently linking groups to surfaces. Epoxide modified surfaces have been used to create DNA chips via the reaction of amino modified oligonucleotides with surfaces. Surfaces with immobilized oligonucleotides can be of use in high throughput DNA and RNA detection systems and in automated DNA amplification applications.

Other uses for microtiter plates are directed toward modifying the surface to make it more hydrophobic rendering it more compatible with organic solvents or to reduce the absorption of drugs usually small organic molecules. For example Total Drug Analysis assays generally rely on using acetonitrile to precipitate proteins and salts from a plasma or serum sample. The drug being assayed must remain in solution for subsequent quantification. Organic solvent compatible microtiter plates also have uses as high performance liquid chromatography HPLC or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry LC MS MS prep devices and as combinatorial chemistry or parallel synthesis reaction vessels either for solution based or solid phase chemistries . Examples of surfaces for these types of uses include MULTICHEM microplates Whatman Inc. Florham Park N.J. United States of America and MULTISCREEN Solvinert Millipore Billerica Mass. United States of America .

According to an embodiment material including one or more blended photo curing and or one or more thermal curing components can be used to fabricate medical devices device components portions of devices surgical devices tools implantable components and the like. The blended material refers to the mixing of photocurable and or thermally curable constituents within the polymer that is to form the device. The use of such a system allows for the formation of discrete objects by activating the first curing system and then in some embodiments adhering such discrete objects to other objects surfaces or materials by activating the second curing system. In some embodiments the dual cure materials can be used to make a medical device or implant outside the body through a first cure of the material then the second cure can be utilized to adhered the device to tissue after implantation into the body. In other embodiments the dual cure materials can be used to make medical devices or implants in stages and then the components can be cured together to form an implant. The medical devices or implants made with the dual cure materials of the present invention can be but are not limited to orthopedic devices cardiovascular devices intraluminal devices dermatological devices oral devices optical devices auditory devices tissue devices organ devices neurological devices vascular devices reproductive devices combinations thereof and the like. Other devices and components that can be coated with the materials and methods disclosed herein include tubes piping vials glassware storage containers transfer containers valves pipettes nozzles labware goggles glasses gloves sinks tanks such as fuel tanks cylinders ceramic devices metal devices polymer devices glass combinations thereof and the like. The materials can be used as coating or linings for such devices to prevent fouling prevent contamination prevent reactions between the container and a substance in the container ease of cleaning combinations thereof and the like. In some embodiments the materials of the present invention adhere to these devices and materials through hydroxy groups on the surface of the devices and form strong interactions which maintain the coating and linings in position.

According to some embodiments an object such as a component of a medical device or an implant or the entire device can be fabricated by forming a liquid precursor in a mold activating a curing mechanism such as photo curing or thermal curing to solidify or partially solidify the precursor and removing the solid object from the mold. The object can then be placed in contact with another component of a medical device or implant a surface a coating or the like and a second curing mechanism is activated such as thermal curing or photo curing to adhere the two objects together. For example the object can be but is not limited to an artificial joint component an artificial bone component an artificial tooth or tooth component an artificial articular surface an artificial lens and the like.

An example of this procedure is shown in steps A C for example. According to liquid fluoropolymer e.g. PFPE material can be introduced into a mold and upon activating a first curing mechanism e.g. thermal curing the PFPE material is solidified to form a tube . Tube can then be inserted into a second tube formed from the same or a different material such as for example a different polymer or a natural material or structure such as tissue or a blood vessel. Next a second curing mechanism e.g. photo curing is activated to adhere the PFPE tube to the second tube .

According to some embodiments directed to orthopedic applications the dual curable materials of the present invention facilitate rebuilding and or building new devices and structures for placement within a living body. Further embodiments include rebuilding and repairing existing biologic or artificial devices tissues and structures in situ. For example dual curable materials may be utilized in building new joints and in repairing existing joints in vitro or in situ.

According to some embodiments a damaged biologic component can be a damaged tissue such as skeletal tissue e.g. spinal components such as discs and vertebral bodies and other skeletal bones . In some embodiments the dual cure materials of the present invention can be used in situ to augment the damaged biologic components. According to such embodiments the method includes surgically inserting a mold structure into the damaged site or preparing the surgical site to act as a receiving mold for liquid dual cure material. The mold structure is configured to receive liquid dual curable material and is geometrically configured similar to the damaged biologic component to be replaced or configured to yield a desired result. Next liquid dual cure material is introduced into the mold and first cured. The first cure can be for example treatment with light or heat. In some embodiments the first cure can be an incomplete cure such that the replacement structure is left compliant. The compliant nature of the replacement structure can facilitate removal of the mold structure from the site of damage or positioning of the replacement component in the desired surgical implant site. After removal of the mold structure the first cured replacement structure can be treated with a second cure to further cure the replacement structure to satisfy desired mechanical properties for the particular application.

In other embodiments the replacement component can be built up either in vitro or in situ. According to these embodiments an opening to a surgical site may be made smaller than an implant required by the site because the implant can be built up a portion at a time e.g. replacing a hip joint through an arthroscopic type procedure . In such embodiments dual cure liquid material as described herein can be introduced into a mold or a surgical site and treated with a first cure. The first cure activates the liquid material to form a first portion of the replacement component such that the component can retain a desired shape. The first portion can be configured to harden upon the first curing or remain compliant. Next in some embodiments a second quantity of liquid material can be introduced to form a second portion of the replacement component. The material of the second portion is treated with a first cure treatment. The first cure treatment used to treat the second portion of the component can be the same technique used on the first portion such that each component retains a viable second cure component. Therefore because each portion of the device retains a viable second cure component after the first cured portions of the device are compiled to form the completed device the portions can be treated with a second curing. Upon second curing the second cure component of the layered portions of the device will be activated and the layered portion will bind together forming one integral device. Multiple portions of the replacement component can be formed as described herein as needed to make a replacement device. According to some embodiments each portion can have different functional and or mechanical properties to impart a desired mechanical and or chemical result on the completed replacement component.

According to other embodiments a portion such as an articular surface of a joint can be formed with the dual cure material of the present invention and attached to a natural joint in situ. According to such embodiments an artificial articular surface can be fabricated from a first cure e.g. thermal cure of the dual cure material of the present invention. The artificial articular surface can then be implanted onto a preexisting joint surface and treated with a second cure e.g. photo cure such that the artificial articular surface binds to the preexisting joint surface.

According to other embodiments dual cure materials of the present invention can be used to replace or augment natural biologic tissue or structures and can be adhered directly to the tissue.

According to some embodiments dual cure materials described herein may be incorporated into various types of repairs or patches as shown in . In one embodiment such a patch can be utilized in lung surgical procedures. Patches include for example but are not limited to sheets of dual cure material configured to be attached and secured directly to living tissue through activation of the second curing mechanism of the dual cure materials.

According to some embodiments a disrupted or damaged material device or surface can be repaired e.g. patched with material of the present invention. As shown in steps A C a patch can be made by molding dual cure material into a desired shape and activating a first cure e.g. thermal cure to form patch . Next patch is placed over a device or tissue that is affected with a disruption or damage e.g. a crack hole surgically altered tissue . After placement of patch over disruption a second curing mechanism is activated e.g. photo curing to adhere the patch to the surface of device . The strength of the patch is dependent upon multiple variables such as for example the size of binding area between patch and tissue the extent of curing administered to the patch tissue combination the chemicals quantities concentrations and the like used in the second curing process the composition of patch the composition of tissue or device combinations thereof and the like. According to alternative embodiments patch can undergo a second cure e.g. thermal or photo curing to attach patch to a compound material or substance that is known to bind to tissue. For example patch can be treated with or adhered to a fribrin sealant component or glue which is well known and used extensively in various clinical settings for adhering tissues together. In other embodiment the patch can be second cure attached to a biocompatible material and the biocompatible material is then stitched to the tissue thereby implanting the patch.

In yet other embodiments the materials of the present invention can be used to fabricate a mold and replicate another object. In some embodiments the object to be molded and replicated can be a medical device or a tissue such as a joint component organ organ scaffold joint skeletal component dental component ocular component vascular component and the like.

According to such embodiments as shown in steps A E a mold is fabricated by taking an object such as a bone and encapsulating the object in a curable matrix such as liquid PDMS precursors. Next the curable matrix is cured. The bone is then removed leaving a mold in a shape that corresponds to the molded object . In some embodiments the cured mold can be reversibly swelled to assist in removal of the object. Next mold can be filled with dual cure materials of the present invention such as for example dual cure liquid PFPE precursors . The dual cure material is then subjected to a first cure e.g. thermal curing to form a replicate object in the shape of bone . Next the replicate object can be implanted into the body as a replacement component. During implantation replicate object can be adhered to natural tissues such as articular cartilage portions of remaining natural bone ligaments tendons other artificial joint components and the like by positioning the tissues with respect to replicate object and subjecting the combination to a second cure e.g. photo curing .

According to other embodiments dual cure materials of the present invention can be used in various cardiovascular applications and in other intraluminal applications. In some of these embodiments the materials can be used to fabricate and or augment body lumens and to form artificial lumens e.g. artificial blood vessels . The dual cure materials of the present invention can be molded as shown in to form replacement blood vessels for replacing damaged and or occluded vessels within a body. Not only can the materials disclosed herein serve as conduits for blood flow but they also can allow for diffusion of oxygen and nutrients through the vessel wall into surrounding tissues thus functioning much like a normal healthy blood vessel.

According to embodiments of the present invention a method of replacing in situ a portion of a blood vessel includes injecting an oxygen permeable bacterial impermeable dual cure liquid PFPE material into a lumen of a portion of a blood vessel such that the dual cure liquid PFPE coats the luminal surface of the blood vessel. The dual cure liquid PFPE is then subjected to a first cure technique to form an artificial blood vessel within the natural blood vessel. The biologic blood vessel can then be removed from the first cured PFPE material and the material can be subjected to a second cure or can be treated with another layer of dual curable liquid PFPE and the combination can be subjected to a second cure. Also the second cure can be applied when the artificial blood vessel is positioned within the subject and activated to bind the material to the natural blood vessel. A working replacement for the blood vessel portion is thereby produced.

Embodiments of the present invention are particularly advantageous regarding repair and or replacement of blood vessels. Given their high oxygen carrying ability and permeability artificial vessels formed from PFPE materials have highly functional properties with synthetic vasavasorum characteristics. PFPE materials allow diffusion of oxygen through the walls and into surrounding dependent tissues allow diffusion of sustaining nutrients and diffusion of metabolites. PFPE materials substantially mimic vessels mechanically as they are flexible and compliant. Moreover embodiments of the present invention are particularly suitable for use in heart by pass surgery and as artificial arterio venous shunts. PFPE materials can also be used to repair natural or synthetic arterio venous shunts by coating the inside surface of the damaged or worn vessel and curing as described herein. According to other embodiments intraluminal prostheses can be employed in sites of a body such as but not limited to biliary tree esophagus bowel tracheo bronchial tree urinary tract and the like.

In another embodiment the dual cure materials of the present invention can be used to fabricate stents for repairing vascular tissue. In some embodiments the dual cure liquid material can be locally implanted and cured during a balloon angioplasty procedure or the like and subjected to a curing or a second curing after being locally positioned. In such embodiments the dual cure liquid material can be first cured to form a manipulable sheet or tube of material. The manipulability of the sheet facilitates implantation of the stent precursor material. The stent precursor material can then be positioned for example by an angioplasty procedure. Upon positioning the stent precursor the implantation device can subject the stent precursor material to a second curing thereby creating a mechanically viable stent.

The dual cure PFPE materials according to embodiments of the present invention may be used with all of the cardiovascular and intraluminal devices described herein. PFPE materials may be utilized in the material s of these devices and or may be provided as a coating on these devices.

According to other embodiments and as shown in a biologic structure having a lumen e.g. for example a blood vessel can be replaced with a medical device molded from the dual cure materials disclosed herein. shows a top view or end view of a biologic structure having a lumen . First in molding the replacement vessel lumen is filled with a temporary filler . Temporary filler can be PDMS foam or another suitable material that can be inserted into vessel . Filler can be administered into lumen such that a desired pressure is applied to the walls of vessel . The pressure applied to the walls of vessel can be a pressure to mimic a biologic condition a pressure below a normal biologic condition a pressure above a normal biologic condition a desired pressure or the like. Vessel is then encapsulated into curable outer matrix such as for example liquid PDMS. Next outer matrix is cured such that vessel is sandwiched between outer matrix and filler .

Referring now to vessel is removed from between outer matrix and filler creating a receiving space . Next replacement material e.g. liquid PFPE or the like having dual cure capabilities as described herein is delivered into receiving space . Replacement material can be injected poured sprayed or the like into receiving space . Next replacement material is subjected to a first cure e.g. photo or thermal curing such that it solidifies at least partially and forms replacement device . Following the first cure outer matrix and filler are removed thereby leaving replacement device . Replacement device has an outer surface an inner surface and includes the characteristics of the natural biologic structure from which it was molded. Furthermore replacement device includes a lumen that mimics the lumen of the biologic structure that replacement device was molded from.

Next replacement device is positioned into the subject in the position where the natural component was removed or any other suitable implant location. Replacement device is aligned with biologic structures that it is configured to adhere to and function with and replacement device is treated with a second cure e.g. thermal or photo curing . The second cure activates components of the replacement device described herein which in turn bind with the surrounding biologic tissue thereby implanting and affixing replacement device with the subject. In other embodiments replacement device can be bound to a bio active polymer that is known to adhere to tissue in the second curing step such that the replacement device can bind to the biologic tissue through the bioactive polymer.

According to another embodiment the dual cure material can be used to form a rigid structure that augments structural support to a skeletal portion of the subject. For example damage to be augmented can be a crack or other defect in a bone. In some embodiments the dual cure liquid material can be first molded or formed in vitro and first cured to form a structure of desired configuration. Next the first cured structure can be implanted and positioned with respect to the damaged biologic structure to be augmented. Once in position the first cured material can be treated with a second cure to further solidify and or bond to the biologic structure. The dual cure mechanism of the present invention facilitates implantation of the structure because upon first curing the structure can retain a specific shape but be very compliant. The compliant nature of the structure after the first cure can reduce trauma inflicted on a patient while implanting the structure. Upon the second curing the structure binds with the adjacent tissue or biologic component seals the crack and provides structural support to the damaged biological component. The composition and degree of curing of the implanted material can be altered to render a structure that resembles a desired functionality such as strength flexibility rigidity elasticity combinations thereof and the like. Accordingly the dual cured flexible material may replace portions of ligaments tendons cartilage muscles and the like as well as tissue e.g. flexible tissues within the body of a subject.

In still further embodiments the dual cure materials of the present invention can be utilized to form other medical devices medical implants biological replacement devices medical procedure tools surface treatments combinations thereof and the like. Other useful applications to which the dual cure material can be applied are disclosed in published U.S. patent application no. 2005 0142315 including the publications cited therein all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

In still further embodiments the dual cure materials disclosed and described herein can be used to form a patterned surface characteristic on the surface of medical devices. The patterned surface characteristic can provide useful properties to medical devices and as medical device coatings. The surface patterning of medical devices and medical implants can provide superhydrophobic coatings that can be extremely non wetting to fluids. The patterned surfaces can also be highly resistant to biological fouling. Dual cure materials can be patterned by pouring a liquid precursor of the dual cure material onto a patterned template e.g. silicon wafer or by photolithography and treating the precursor to a first curing whereby the material solidifies or partially solidifies and takes the shape of the pattern on the patterned wafer. In some embodiments the pattern can have structures that are between about 1 nm and about 500 nm. In other embodiments the pattern can have structures that are between about 1 m and 10 m. In one embodiment the pattern is a repeated diamond shape pattern.

Next the first cured material is released from the wafer to yield a patterned layer. Such a layer can then be used directly as a medical device or can be adhered through a second curing to other objects by the orthogonal curing methods previously described thereby coating the surface of medical devices and implants and resulting in decreased wettability and decreased likelihood of bio fouling of the medical device or implant.

In other embodiments the dual cure materials are useful in dermatological applications including for example bandages dressings wound healing applications burn care reconstructive surgery surgical glue sutures and the like. Because PFPE materials are oxygen permeable and bacterial impermeable tissue underlying a PFPE bandage can receive oxygen while being protected against the ingress of dirt microbial organisms pathogens and other forms of contamination and toxicity. In addition the oxygen permeability and carrying capacity of PFPE materials can also help with preventing necrosis of healthy tissue under bandages and dressings or under an area being treated.

According to an embodiment of the present invention a method of applying instant skin to the body of a subject includes applying an oxygen permeable bacterial impermeable liquid dual cure PFPE material onto a portion of the body of a subject. The dual cure PFPE material can be treated with a first cure to form layers of an approximate predetermined size and or shape. After the first cure the layered PFPE dual cure material is placed on the damaged zone of the patient. The dual cure PFPE is then subjected to a second cure such that the dual cure PFPE adheres to the patient and provides a oxygen permeable microbial impermeable waterproof flexible elastic biocompatible artificial skin layer.

According to further embodiments ocular implants and contact lenses can be formed from the dual cure materials of the present invention. These devices are advantageous over conventional ocular implants and contact lenses because the PFPE material is permeable to oxygen and resistant to bio fouling. In addition because of the lower surface energy there is more comfort to the wearer as a result of the low friction generated the PFPE. In addition the refractive index of PFPE materials can be adjusted for optimum performance for ocular implants and contact lenses. Further embodiments include cochlear implants utilizing the dual cure PFPE material. Using dual cure PFPE materials tissue in growth can be minimized thus making removal of the device safer and less traumatic.

According to other embodiments of the present invention materials of the present disclosure are formed with nano scale voids. The nano scale voids can provide a porous material and or increase the permeability of the material. According to such embodiments a fluorinated or non fluorinated fluid is introduced to the precursors described herein in low concentrations. The materials are then cured as described herein including but not limited to UV curing thermal curing evaporation combinations thereof and the like. Next the fluid is evaporated or removed from the cured material. Following removal of the fluid from the cured material nano scopic voids are left behind. These nano scale voids can give porosity to the material increase permeability of the material can be interconnected or independent combinations thereof and the like. According to one embodiment the concentration of the fluid is less than about 15 . According to another embodiment the concentration of the fluid is less than about 10 . In yet another embodiment the concentration of the fluid is less than about 5 . According to such embodiments the fluid acts as a porogen leaving nano scopic voids in the cured elastomer thereby increase the gas permeability of the material generating nano scale porosity in the material increasing liquid permeability combinations thereof and the like. Other methods for fabricating nanoscopic voids in the materials of the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 160 030 to Chaouk et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety including all references cited therein.

According to other embodiments of the present invention traditional applications for silicone can be improved with the materials and methods of the present invention and according to further embodiments the applications can be replaced with the materials and methods disclosed herein. Silicone applications to which the materials and methods of the present invention are applicable include mold release agents release layers respiratory masks anti graffiti paint systems aqueous coatings sealants mechanically assembled monolayers micro plates and covers tubing water repellant and organic solvent repellant.

Microextraction is a further application to which the materials and methods of the present invention can be applied. For example the materials and methods of the present invention can be applied to substitute for or enhance the current techniques and chemicals used in microextraction. An example of microextraction is detailed in an article in Analytical Chemistry 69 6 1197 1210 1997 in which the authors placed 80 microliter chips of OV 1 extraction medium poly dimethylsiloxane in 50 ml flasks with 49 ml of aqueous sample shook the flasks for 45 to 100 minutes removed the chips and placed them in the cell of a Shimadzu UV 260 spectrophotometer Shimadzu Corp. Kyoto Japan to obtain a UV spectrum. Further described is a preconcentration by SPME that enables UV absorption spectroscopy to identify benzene at detection limits of 97 ppb naphthalene at 0.40 ppb 1 methylnaphthalene at 0.41 ppb and 8 other aromatics at 5.5 12 ppb. In tests of samples spiked with unleaded gasoline JP4 jet fuel and no. 1 diesel fuel preconcentration permits direct quantitation of dilute levels of aromatic species in aqueous samples without interference from humic substances in solution.

According to other embodiments an application of the present invention can include substituting the materials and methods of the present invention for traditional chromatographic separation materials. According to yet another embodiment of the present invention the materials and methods of the present invention can be combined with typical chromatographic separation materials. Chromatographic separations useful with the present invention are described in the following studies incorporated herein by reference and which describe that natural enantiomeric distribution of terpene alcohols on various natural matrices determined that although distinctive for each matrix the distribution is widely differentiated. While there is data available on the free bound linalool content in muscat wines no data is available on the enantiomeric distribution of the same terpene alcohols in these wines. Researchers at DIFCA Sezione di Chimica Analitica Argoali mentare ed. Ambientale Universita degli Studi di Milano Via Celoria 2 20133 Milan Italy Tel 39 2 26607227 Fax 39 2 2663057 have characterized muscat wines using gas chromatography GC chiral analysis. To determine the aromatic fraction of muscat wines the enantiomeric excess of linalool and terpineol must be measured. F. Tateo and M. Bononi used two different fibers for the solid phase microextraction SPME one apolar 100 micron non bonded polydimethylsiloxane and one polar partially crosslinked 65 micron carbowax divinylbenzene . There was greater adsorption of the linalool using the polar fiber. The enantiomeric distribution of the linalool and of the terpineol were within fairly narrow limits and were considered characteristic indices. In order to assess the selectivity of SPME adsorption of the polar fiber with respect to a number of molecules comparison was made using data obtained by direct injection. Greater sensitivity for the molecules was obtained using this technique.

In other applications the materials and methods of the present invention can be substituted for PDMS materials used in outdoor capacities such as for example PDMS shed materials used to cover high voltage outdoor insulators. According to further embodiments the presently disclosed materials and methods can be combined with PDMS materials used in outdoor capacities such as for example the high voltage outdoor insulator sheds described above. It is important that the surface of the shed of the insulator remains hydrophobic throughout its services life. It is known however that electrical discharges lead to an oxidation of the traditional surface and a temporary loss of hydrophobicity. According to a study of traditional materials crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane PDMS containing Irganox 1076 Tinuvin 770 or Irganox 565 Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp. Tarrytown N.Y. United States of America prepared by swelling PDMS in a solution of one of these stabilizers in n hexane was exposed to a corona discharge and the corona exposure time t crit to form a brittle silica like layer was determined by optical microscopy. The critical corona exposure time showed a linear increase with increasing stabilizer concentration Tinuvin 770 showed the highest efficiency and Irganox 1076 the lowest. The increase in t crit on corona exposure of the stabilized samples with reference to the value for unstabilized PDMS was similar to that reported earlier for air plasma exposed samples. The efficiency of the stabilizers towards corona induced surface oxidation of PDMS also was confirmed by X ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art however traditional materials utilizing PDMS can be significantly improved by the addition or augmentation with the materials and methods of the present invention.

Microvalves actuated by paraffin such as for example microvalves containing silicone rubber seals actuated by heating and cooling of paraffin have been proposed for development as integral components of microfluidic systems. According to an embodiment of the present invention the materials and methods of the present invention can be substituted for or combined with the silicone rubber seals of such devices as the disclosed microvalve materials thereby increasing the physical and chemical properties of such microvalves.

Scratch free surfaces are yet a further application to which the materials and methods of the present invention can be applied. The materials and methods of the present invention can be substituted for or used to augment the traditional scratch free surface materials to improve their physical and chemical properties. As an example research from Dow Corning of Freeland Mich. has shown that adding masterbatches to thermoplastic olefins TPOs improves scratch resistance of TPO components. The company s MB50 series of masterbatches are in carrier resin formats containing 50 ultra high molecular weight polydimethylsiloxane a scratch resisting and lubricating additive. The additive lowers the coefficient of friction at the surface of the molded part. Surface modifying masterbatches are now utilized and developed for various applications such as in the automotive sector where it is being used in consoles airbags door skins and exterior components. Substituting the materials and methods of the present invention or combining the materials and methods of the present invention to such scratch free surface materials can improve the scratch resistance of the materials.

The materials and methods of the present invention also can be applied to materials and methods used in the fabrication of sensors. An example of applying the materials and methods of the present invention to the materials that are used to make sensors such as for example polymeric membrane paste compositions will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art from the following. Advantageous polymeric membrane paste compositions include a polyurethane hydroxylated poly vinyl chloride compound and a silicone based compound in appropriate solvent systems to provide screen printable pastes of the appropriate viscosity and thixotropy. For an ion sensor to be commercially acceptable it must have qualities beyond just electrochemical performance. For a sensor to be cost effective it must be reproducible using mass production systems. There must be common electrochemical response characteristics within the members of a batch fabricated group. If the sensors are not all substantially identical they will each be characterized by different lifetimes and response characteristics creating difficulties in the field not the least of which is the added cost associated with recalibration of equipment whenever the sensor is changed. Polymeric membranes are in common use as transducers in solid state chemical sensors particularly because such membranes have high selectivity to the ion of interest and can be made selective to a wide range of ions using one or many readily available ionophores. One known technique for forming the membranes is solvent casting a technique which originated with ion selective electrode technology. In addition to being a rather tedious operation particularly in view of the small size of the sensors this production method yields very high losses. The thickness and shape of the membrane cannot be controlled resulting in an unacceptable lack of sensor reproducibility. An objective of the research at the University of Michigan was to provide a simple and economical system for batch fabrication of solid state ion selective sensors. Their method consists of installing a mask on a semiconductor substrate the mask having at least one aperture having a predetermined configuration which corresponds with a desired membrane configuration. A polymeric membrane paste is applied to the mask and a squeegee is drawn across the mask to force the paste into the aperture and in communication with the semiconductor substrate. In one form the mask is of a metallic material which can be a stainless steel mesh coated with a photoreactive emulsion. In another form the mask is a metal foil stencil. The membrane which ultimately is produced has a thickness which corresponds to that of the mask between 25 and 250 microns. The membrane paste can be formed of a polyurethane with an effective portion of an hydroxylated poly vinyl chloride copolymer a polyimide based compound a silicone based compound such as silanol terminated polydimethylsiloxane with the resistance reducing additive ON derivatized silicone rubber or any other suitable polymeric material. Thus it will be appreciated that the materials and methods of the present invention can be applied to the materials and processes for forming sensors such as the polymeric membrane compositions polyimide based compounds polydimethylsiloxane and silicone rubber for example.

In another further embodiment the materials and methods of the present invention can be substituted for or can be used to augment the materials and methods used in sol gel capillary microextraction. Typically sol gel technology involves the encapsulation of active ingredients in micro and nano sized matrices often silica based matrices as well as nanospheres. Sol gel capillary microextraction sol gel CME for example is a viable solventless extraction technique for the preconcentration of trace analytes. Sol gel coated capillaries are often employed for the extraction and preconcentration of a wide variety of polar and nonpolar analytes. Two different types of sol gel coatings are used for extraction sol gel poly dimethylsiloxane PDMS and sol gel poly ethylene glycol PEG . A gravity fed sample dispensing unit can be used to perform the extraction. The analysis of the extracted analytes can be performed by gas chromatography GC . The extracted analytes are transferred to the GC column via thermal desorption. For this the capillary with the extracted analytes can be connected to the inlet end of the GC column using a two way press fit fused silica connector housed inside the GC injection port. Desorption of the analytes from the extraction capillary can be performed by rapid temperature programming at 100 degrees C. min of the GC injection port. The desorbed analytes are transported down the system by the helium flow and further focused at the inlet end of the GC column maintained at 30 degrees C. Sol gel PDMS capillaries are commonly used for the extraction of nonpolar and moderately polar compounds such as but not limited to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons aldehydes ketones while sol gel PEG capillaries are used for the extraction of polar compounds such as but not limited to alcohols phenols amines . For both polar and nonpolar analytes the run to run and capillary to capillary relative standard deviation RSD values for GC peak areas often remain under 6 and 4 respectively. Parts per quadrillion level detection limits are achieved by coupling sol gel CME with gas chromatography flame ionization detection GC FID . The use of thicker sol gel coatings and longer capillary segments of larger diameter or capillaries with sol gel monolithic beds often lead to further enhancement of the extraction sensitivity. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art replacing or combining the matrices and nanospheres commonly used in sol gel applications with the materials and methods of the present invention can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of sol gel processes.

In alternative embodiments the materials and methods of the present invention can be applied to processes such as process aid for plastics and membrane separating processes.

Specific photolithographic patterning of curable materials disclosed herein through controlled light exposure such as for example rastering a focused source flood exposure through a mask a highly organized precision light source combinations thereof or the like provides fabrication of polymeric micro devices. Furthermore according to embodiments of the present invention living radical photo polymerization of materials disclosed herein provides parallel fabrication of multilayer devices. Living radical photo polymerization uses specific initiator chemistries that continuously reactivate during exposure to UV light for synthesizing linear polymers. According to some embodiments the polymer chain ends are not permanently terminated or deactivated and in conjunction with cross linking monomers living radical photo polymerization enables initiation and covalent adhesion of new polymer chains or films to surfaces of previously photo polymerized structures.

According to some embodiments methods for photo patterned polymerization of polymers such as polymers discloses herein can be used to generate micro devices such as microfluidic devices with highly complex three dimensional designs extremely versatile surface and a plurality of physical and chemical properties. In alternative methods the materials disclosed herein can be combined with materials such as filters different polymerizable monomer formulations such as for example photo curable agents thermal curable agents combinations thereof or the like to form cured components that can be combined as layers of an overall structure or device. Following initial curing of the materials adjacent layers or devices can be covalently adhered together through a second curing process or procedure such as described herein to form complex multilayered devices. According to some embodiments material properties can be initially selected by altering the composition of the base material and or monomer formulation in the base material according to materials and methods described herein such that the resulting layers of a device or the device itself will function for a predetermined use.

According to a reaction chamber is provided. Reaction chamber is typically shaped similar to a cup with sides such that it can house a liquid without the liquid spilling from chamber . Chamber can have a flat curved or the like bottom chamber or can have a shape or recesses contained therein. Chamber preferable has sides with a height equal to or greater than a height of a desired device. In some embodiments sides are between about 1 nm and about 100 mm. According to other embodiments sides are between about 1 micron and about 500 micron. According to yet other embodiments sides are between about 50 nm and about 50 mm. Liquid material such as materials disclosed herein for example PFPE or a derivative of PFPE as disclosed herein is presented into chamber and filled to a desired depth. The desired dept can be determined by a desired thickness of the resulting device or layer to be fabricated in a first fabrication step.

According to some embodiments a mask such as for example an optical mask alignment system having a desired mask design or pattern is placed above or in contact with liquid polymer material . In some embodiments masks are made from commercially available emulsion films with a high resolution plotter. According to such embodiments masks are made from rapid prototyping and device optimization. Using a method of mask fabricating such as these typically generates a resolution of about 10 micron. According to other embodiments higher resolution i.e. less than about 1 micron and or more durable masks can be fabricated by deposition of chrome on etched quartz glass or alternative printing methods. Masks can be aligned using registration marks or an optical alignment system. In some embodiments mask and liquid material exposed by the pattern of mask is treated with a light or UV cure such as described herein. In some embodiments cure activates photo curable monomer components in liquid material such that liquid material is cured in a pattern according to pattern of mask . According to other embodiments after liquid material is presented into chamber liquid material is treated with a highly organized light source such that primarily predetermined areas of liquid material is cured to a solid form or a substantially solid form. If mask is utilized it is then removed and any uncured liquid material is removed by treating the uncured liquid material with a solvent.

According to some embodiments it can be desirable to form and adhere a second layer or a second device to the initially cured liquid material . According to such embodiments voids left behind after removing uncured liquid material are filled with a sacrificial layer . In some embodiments sacrificial layer can be a wax such as paraffin wax or the like. Sacrificial layer is preferably a liquid or molten solid such that it fills voids to preserve open spaces in the material such as for example channels valve ports or openings recesses and the like in the cured material. According to some embodiments voids are filled such that sacrificial layer is flush or even with a surface of initially cured liquid material . In some embodiments excess sacrificial layer is removed such that the surface of initially cured liquid material is exposed.

Next a second liquid material is introduced onto the surface of initially cured liquid material and sacrificial layer . As described above a mask having pattern a second pattern a precision light source or the like is then delivered to the second liquid material such that a predetermined portion of second liquid material becomes photo activated and cured. Space between the photo mask and the previous layer dictates the height of the second layer. During the photo activating and curing process second liquid material can also chemically bind to initially cured liquid material thereby adhering the two layers together and forming a single device.

The above described process can be repeated to form a multiple layered predetermined three dimensional structure. Following fabrication of the desired structure any sacrificial layer is removed from the structure such as by heating or treating the structure with a solvent. The sacrificial layer removal process can in some embodiments be analogous to negative photoresist chemistry unexposed regions are removed and exposed regions remain after solvent rinsing. In some embodiments the subsequent layers can have the same or different physical configuration and or the same or different material composition and or properties according to desired uses of the device.

In some embodiments a shape or recess can be included in chamber . Accordingly when first liquid material is cured around shape shape will leave a void in cured first liquid material after the cured first liquid material is removed from chamber . In some embodiments shape can be a chamber path system of chambers valve ports or the like commonly associated with microfluidic devices.

According to yet other embodiments the base materials of the device can include as disclosed herein thermally curable components. According to such embodiments following fabrication of the device by build up of multiple layers as described above the device can be treated with a thermal cure. Thermal cure activates the thermally curable components of the base material and further adheres the multiple layers together or can adhere the device to a second device.

According to some embodiments the material of the device can include moieties such as moieties disclosed herein for example as described above with respect to the fourth precursor. According to such embodiments the moiety precursor remains available at the surfaces of the cured device such that a sample passed over the surface can react with the moieties. Many functions performed in microfluidic devices rely upon interactions between fluids and transported chemical or biological compounds therefore fabricating microfluidic devices with functional moiety precursors that remain available after fabrication of the device can facilitate microfluidic reactions. According to some embodiments the moieties included in the material can be selected and altered for a desired function of the fabricated device. Often spatially controlled surface properties that differ from the bulk material properties are desirable in microfluidic devices. Incorporation of a living radical initiator in some embodiments for example in the monomer formulations can enable spatially resolved grafting or modification via photolithographic methods and surface mediated living radical photo polymerization.

The following Examples have been included to provide guidance to one of ordinary skill in the art for practicing representative embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. In light of the present disclosure and the general level of skill in the art those of skill can appreciate that the following Examples are intended to be exemplary only and that numerous changes modifications and alterations can be employed without departing from the scope of the presently disclosed subject matter.

A PFPE microfluidic device has been previously reported by Rolland J. et al. 2004 126 2322 2323 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The specific PFPE material disclosed in Rolland J. et al. was not chain extended and therefore did not possess the multiple hydrogen bonds that are present when PFPEs are chain extended with a diisocyanate linker. Nor did the material posses the higher molecular weights between crosslinks that are needed to improve mechanical properties such as modulus and tear strength which are critical to a variety of microfluidics applications. Furthermore this material was not functionalized to incorporate various moieties such as a charged species a biopolymer or a catalyst.

Herein is described a variety of methods to address these issues. Included in these improvements are methods which describe chain extension improved adhesion to multiple PFPE layers and to other substrates such as glass silicon quartz and other polymers as well as the ability to incorporate functional monomers capable of changing wetting properties or of attaching catalysts biomolecules or other species. Also described are improved methods of curing PFPE elastomers which involve thermal free radical cures two component curing chemistries and photocuring using photoacid generators.

Firstly a predetermined amount e.g. 5 grams of a chain extended PFPE dimethacrylate containing a small amount of photoinitiator such as hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone is measured. Next a 1 1 ratio by weight e.g. 5 grams of a chain extended PFPE diisocyanate is added. Next an amount e.g. 0.3 mL of a PFPE tetrol Mn 2000 g mol is then added such that there is a stoichiometric amount of N C O and OH moieties. The three components are then mixed thoroughly and degassed under vacuum.

Master templates are generated using photolithography and are coated with a thin layer of metal e.g. Gold Palladium using an argon plasma. Thin layers for devices are spin coated at 1500 rpm from the PFPE blend onto patterned substrates. A thin flat non patterned layer also is spin coated. Separately thicker layers are cast onto the metal coated master templates typically by pooling the material inside for example a PDMS gasket. All layers are then placed in a UV chamber purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes and photocured for ten minutes into solid rubbery pieces under a thorough nitrogen purge. The layers can then be trimmed and inlet outlet holes punched. Next the layers are stacked and aligned in registered positions such that they form a conformal seal. The stacked layers are then heated at 105 C. for 10 minutes. The heating step initiates the thermal cure of the thermally curable material which is physically entangled in the photocured matrix. Because the layers are in conformal contact strong adhesion is obtained. The two adhered layers can then be peeled from the patterned master or lifted off with a solvent such as dimethyl formamide and placed in contact with a third flat photocured substrate which has not yet been exposed to heat. The three layer device is then baked for 15 hours at 110 C. to fully adhere all three layers.

In a further embodiment the amount of thermal cure substance added to the material is about 10 percent of the amount of photocure substance. According to another embodiment the amount of thermal cure substance is about 50 percent of the amount of the photocure substance.

The chemical structure of each component will be described below. In the following example the first component Component 1 is a chain extended photocurable PFPE liquid precursor. The synthesis consists of the chain extension of a commercially available PFPE diol ZDOL with a common diisocyanate isophorone diisocyanate IPDI using classic urethane chemistry with an organo tin catalyst. Following chain extension the chain is end capped with a methacrylate containing diisocyanate monomer EIM .

The second component is a chain extended PFPE diisocyanate. It is made by the reaction of ZDOL with IPDI in a molar ratio such that the resulting polymer chain is capped with isocyanate groups Component 2a . The reaction again makes use of classic urethane chemistry with an organo tin catalyst.

The second part of the thermally curable component is a commercially available perfluoropolyether tetraol with a molecular weight of 2 000 g mol Component 2b .
