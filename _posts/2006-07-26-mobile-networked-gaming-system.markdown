This application claims the benefit of priority from international patent application number PCT IB2006 002153 filed Jul. 26 2006.

The present invention is directed to a mobile networked gaming system having one or more games available to the user.

Several categories of networked gaming systems are well known in the prior art. A networked gaming system may be a web based java application operable on a computer for example Yahoo Games. Further a networked gaming system may be in the form of a downloadable software application that has a unique graphical user interface GUI and may connect to the network via a backend of the software for example the PartyPoker.com client application. Even further a networked gaming system may be in the form of a networked video game console wherein several players playing a game are connected to a network through their video came consoles e.g. Xbox . Other categories of networked gaming systems are apparent to those persons having ordinary skill in the art.

Furthermore a networked gaming system may be operable on a mobile phone or other wireless device. Wireless technology has evolved greatly over the past decade allowing users to download and play games on their mobile devices. Games may be downloaded to the wireless device through a wireless network. Games may also be pre installed on the wireless device when the user purchases the wireless device. Generally a connection to the wireless network is not required for a user to play a downloaded game because the game may be a single player game. According to at least one research agency the market for downloadable mobile games will grow six fold over the five year period 2005 to 2010. It is expected that the number of consumers using downloadable games will grow from 32 million in 2005 to 220 million in 2009.

As wireless technology advances more games will utilize the wireless network so that multiple users connected to a wireless network may play games against one another. These types of games are generally called multi player games.

Furthermore in recent years online gaming has reached record highs due in part to the increase in gaming options such as poker online casino games and online sports betting. Some forecasters believe that with the widespread penetration of mobile phones poker casino betting trend will carry over from the PC to the wireless device.

It comes as no surprise that many companies that operate networked gaming systems on computers or elsewhere are moving forward with implementing a mobile phone version of their applications. Some of the considerations during this transition to wireless devices may include building a profitable mobile gaming customer base educating the consumer on mobile gaming opportunities adjusting the game play to make the best use of the mobile format small screens . Other considerations may include installing an accessible and time effective customer registration process suitable for the keyboard restraints of the mobile device creating a good user experience on the mobile device implementing effective billing models and registration processes encrypting transactions to ensure secure billing or ensuring that any age verification processes are in place. Another important consideration may be to design games to suit the limitations of mobile phone technology. Besides having a relatively small screen and limited keyboard capabilities mobile phones also have limited battery life memory and processing capabilities.

Some networked gaming system operators have implemented scaled down mobile phone versions of their networked gaming systems. These scaled down mobile phone versions generally do not offer the same gaming choices to the user as a standard PC based networked gaming system because of the limitations of the mobile technology including the small screen limited keyboard limited battery life limited memory and limited processing capabilities. For example one operator offers only casino games slots blackjack roulette instant win scratch card etc. on their mobile platform but the same operator offers poker Hold em 7 card stud Omaha etc. in addition to casino games on their standard PC based platform. Other operators have a casino a poker room and also a sports betting console on their standard PC based platform but offers only a sports betting console on their mobile platform. In most cases operators do not have a poker client available on their mobile platform because it is simply too difficult to create a mobile poker client that would give the user an enjoyable experience. Even if an operator has a mobile poker client generally this mobile client offers only a single player poker game where the user plays against an imaginary computer controlled player.

Because of the technical barriers only a few networked gaming system operators have launched mobile multi player poker clients. One of the most advanced multi player mobile poker operators only offers limit poker meaning that during each betting round a player may either fold call bet a pre defined amount or raise a pre defined amount. Limit poker unlike no limit poker does not allow a user to bet raise to any amount but limits the player to bet raise a pre defined amount . As mobile phones become more advanced and the users become more sophisticated an operator that offers only one game type i.e. limit poker will not endure in the marketplace.

As more game types are added to a given mobile gaming system the user may have to navigate through multiple menus to access a game that the user intends to play. Because of the limited memory and processing capabilities of mobile phones the mobile phone may freeze or time out as the user navigates through the one or more menus as the user tries to access a game. This freezing problem is one of the problems with current mobile networked gaming systems. There are simply too many menus that a user must navigate to access a game causing the mobile phone or other wireless device to freeze or timeout.

As multiple game types are added to mobile networked gaming systems the number of games available from single operator may be very large. For example for the game of poker there may be multiple game types Limit Hold em No Limit Hold em Pot Limit Hold em Omaha 7 Card Stud Razz multiple game styles cash game tournament sit and go freeroll and multiple game stakes 0.05 0.10 Limit through No Limit . Thus there may be many variations of poker available to the user of the mobile networked gaming system.

Navigating a PC based poker client is already very challenging for some novice users so the added complexity of trying to navigate a myriad of choices on a mobile phone would undoubtedly turn a novice user away from the mobile gaming system. Furthermore because of the limited memory and processing capacity of mobile phones navigating through multiple menus to find a game may cause the mobile phone to freeze or time out.

Moreover once a user has located a game that the user would like to play either on a PC or mobile device and has further located the desired variation of that specific game the user may not be able to play the game because all available player positions or tables are full for that specific variation of the game. This may be a common concern for users who like to play popular games because any available position seat is filled almost instantly after it becomes vacant. This is a major concern for networked gaming system operators and mobile networked gaming system operators because users may become frustrated and decide not to play on that particular networked gaming system in the future. A partial solution to the seating problem is allowing users to join a waiting list for that specific game. Having a waiting list is helpful but a waiting list is not fully effective because of its inherent deterrent effects. Some users may not want to join a waiting list because they are either impatient are very selective about the game table they play at or otherwise. Further when users are waiting they are not playing. This may cause a decrease in revenue for the networked gaming system operator or possibly a reduction in the revenue that the networked gaming system operator may earn through advertising.

Attempts have been made to alleviate some of the problems users face when trying to connect to a specific game of a networked gaming system or mobile networked gaming system. A particular PC based poker client not a mobile client has a feature called QuickSeat that lets players bypass the lobby and choose which limit game type and stakes they would like to play. But the QuickSeat feature may not fully solve the problems associated with mobile networked gaming systems having a plurality of games available to the user. First the QuickSeat feature has only three fields by which the user may narrow the game selection process. Second the QuickSeat feature does not automatically buy in to the table i.e. take money out of the user s account and sit at the table with that money . Once a table has been found that meets the three search criteria the user must manually select how much money he would like to take to that table. Third the QuickSeat feature cannot save a user s preferences and automatically seat a player at a table that meets various user defined criteria. A player using the QuickSeat feature must re enter his search criteria each time the user logs in to the networked gaming system.

A mobile networked gaming system wherein a downloadable game client application connects a player to at least one game server or wireless network wherein the at least one game table is hosted on said game server. The game server or wireless network provides game operations and displays for transmission to the game client application and a display including at least one screen display including at least one lobby screen display from which a player can manually request to be seated at one or more of a plurality of virtual game positions in one or more of a plurality of multi player or single player games. Furthermore a selectable automated seating option is available for automatically seating a player at one or more of a plurality of virtual game positions wherein a player is directly seated when the player logs in to the mobile networked gaming system. Embodiments of the present invention are disclosed as a mobile poker client application and a mobile casino client application incorporating the above features.

In one embodiment the present invention is incorporated into a mobile networked gaming system application such that when a user logs in to networked gaming system the user is immediately taken to his preferred game.

These and other features and advantages are evident from the following description of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.

The description herein describes an embodiment of the present invention wherein the invention is incorporated into a mobile phone that is connected to a wireless network. Persons having ordinary skill in the art recognize that the invention is not limited to those embodiments discussed herein.

There are a plurality of ways that a user may download a game client application to a user s mobile phone. First a user may navigate the Internet on a PC to a website where the user may enter the phone number of his mobile phone. In a few moments the user may receive an SMS Text Message or WAP Push on the mobile phone with a link to download the application. The user may need to select the link to download the game client application. Second the game client application may be downloaded via SMS or text through the mobile phone. The user may text a shortcode to the mobile network gaming system operator with a specific message e.g. Poker and then the operator may send the user a SMS Message WAP Push with a link to download the application. The user may need to select the link to download the game. Other methods of downloading a game client application to a mobile device are also known.

There are several ways for a mobile game client application to become active. In one embodiment when the mobile game client application is chosen from a list of mobile game client applications available on a mobile device the mobile gaming application may login automatically once the user selects it. This type of auto login option may be beneficial or convenient to a user because the user may be the only person to have access to that mobile device. In contrast the mobile gaming application may be configured so that a user would have to manually log in with a username and password each time the user would like to access the mobile gaming application. Referring to an embodiment of a mobile phone is shown with a log in screen displayed. Two text fields are visible a username field and a password field . The user may use the keypad to type in a username and password specific to the user. The user may use a navigation pad to move up using an up key down using a down key left using a left key and right using a right key as necessary. In the case of a log in screen as shown in the user may use the down key to move a cursor down to the password field from the username field . The user may press an OK button to submit a username and password. Furthermore if the user is a new user of this application and does not have a username password unique to the user then the user may select a New user option by selecting a left softkey . This selection will take a new user through the registration process. If the user has accidentally reached to the log in screen shown in the user may select the Back option by selecting a right softkey . Furthermore in an embodiment of the present invention the at least one lobby screen display is accessible by the mobile game client application without a player logging in to the mobile game client application. A user may be able to view tables without logging in but in order for a user to play for real money or play money the user may need to log in.

A main screen as seen in may further have several selectable options available to the user. The options may be numbered so that the user may simply choose the corresponding number on the keypad to select that option. For example by selecting the number 3 on the keypad the user would choose the Favorites option. Also an option may be highlighted and the user may use the up key or the down key to move the highlighted option up or down. The user may select a highlighted option by pressing the OK button . Other options may also be available to the user by pressing softkey buttons. A left softkey and a right softkey may be available. By selecting a softkey a user selects the option that is visible directly above the softkey. As seen in selecting the left softkey will choose the Cashier option while selecting the right softkey will select the Logout option.

There may be several options available to a user once logged in. As seen in may be a Play for Real option a Play for Fun option a Favorites option a Settings option a Help Support option a Cashier option a Logout option or a My Account option . Other options that may be available to a user would be known to persons having ordinary skill in the art. For example if a mobile networked gaming operator operates several different game client applications i.e. a poker client a casino client a backgammon client then there may be selectable options available to the user of any of these client applications that links the user directly to other client applications operated by the mobile networked gaming system operator.

A Favorites option allows users to set up a favorite games list and have quick access to these games. This feature will be discussed in depth later.

Selecting a Settings option may take the user to another screen from which a user may choose various game client application settings.

Selecting a Help Support option may open a new screen from which a user may get help or support for the game client application. Also it may provide frequently asked questions FAQs that may help the user with problems.

Selecting the Cashier option may take the user to a new screen where the user may cash out withdraw money from his real balance or may deposit more money into his real balance . To deposit money a user may need to access a third party client to facilitate a transfer of funds from a credit card debit card bank account or otherwise as is well known to those having ordinary skill in the art.

Selecting a My Account option may take a user to another screen from which a user may change his account specific options and see all account specific information.

Selecting a Play for Real option may take the user to a new screen from which the user may access real money games.

Selecting a Play for Fun option may take the user to a new screen from which the user may access play money games.

As seen in selecting a My Account option may take a user to another screen from which account specific features are available. The screen may have selectable options like for example Account Info My Balance and Points Cashier Network Status Log Out or other options that would be obvious to those having ordinary skill in the art.

An Account Info option may open a screen to a login page to view or edit account settings. If the user is already logged in as shown in selecting the Account Info option would take a user directly to the appropriate page.

A Cashier option may open a new screen to the account cashier page. This may be the same screen accessible directly from the main screen via the left softkey as seen in .

A Logout option may log a user out of the mobile networked game client application. If the user is already logged out the Logout option may change to a Log in option.

Referring to a Settings option when selected may open up a new screen that allows a user to manage his settings. It may include the following areas. On off sections may be represented by checkboxes.

As seen in a Help Support option may be available. The following is an embodiment of a list of selectable options available to a user who selects a Help Support option parenthetical notes may not be visible to a user .

The thrust of the present invention consists in extending in data depth and functionality a standard favorites menu. As seen in a user may select a Favorites option that may open a new screen from which the user may set his favorites. Recall that a mobile networked gaming system operator may operate various mobile game client applications. Thus favorites may be vertical independent i.e. a user can have multiple favorites from various game client applications each of which is operated by the same mobile networked gaming system operator. Favorites may be included on an account level meaning that a user may set personal favorites. For advanced systems the mobile networked gaming system along with the mobile game client application may suggest favorites to the user based on player game history. An automated seating option or AutoSeat of said mobile game client application is further selectable by the mobile networked gaming system whereby personal gaming history including but not limited to a game category a specific game type stakes or an amount of money that a player commonly plays may be recorded by the mobile networked gaming system and a player may be taken directly to a table upon logging into the system in accordance with the recorded personal gaming history of a player. Furthermore based on the personal gaming history of a player some amount of money may be taken from a player s account when seating a player such that the player is seated with said amount of money usable for game play.

The Favorites option may cover three types of favorites category favorites direct favorites and AutoSeat favorites. Each of the three types requires different handling in functionality and representation.

Category favorites are those of the type where a further selection by the user is still necessary before being able to access a game. When selecting a category the proper brand specific mobile game client application lobby may open up in the messaging program and the according sub category opened. For example if the user selects the category favorite Slots then the Casino lobby opens if not already open and the category slots expands. The user may still need to select which game to play from a general category like Slots . Category favorites may be convenient for a user who enjoys playing various games located on various mobile game client applications each of which is operated by the same mobile networked gaming system operator.

Direct favorites are those of the type where a specific game can be directly accessed not simply a category of games and no additional refinement or action has to be done by the user. When clicking on a direct favorite the user will directly be sent to the according game. The buy in window opens and the user can buy in and sit down. All standard logic when accessing a table will be applied e.g. if insufficient funds then user will be prompted to go to cashier . For example if the user selects the direct favorite Poker Cash Games Cash Pot Limit Omaha 0.10 0.25 PL then the user will be automatically taken to a poker cash game pot limit Omaha where the blinds are 0.10 and 0.25. The user chooses the amount of his buy in and sits down and may begin playing.

A mobile networked gaming system may include an automated seating option or AutoSeat feature of said mobile game client application capable of receiving and storing personal preference information including but not limited to a game category a specific game type stakes and an amount of money to be taken from a player s account when seating a player and for seating a player at a table in accordance with said stored personal preference information. AutoSeat favorites are those of the type where the user has selected an AutoSeat option and also provided some more information and is then automatically seated and bought in when the user chooses this option. For example if a user has the AutoSeat option selected on a No Limit Hold em table having blinds of 1 2 and a user buy in of 200 then once the user signs on he will automatically be taken to a No Limit Hold em table having blinds of 1 2 and the user will be bought in for 200 automatically. A goal of the AutoSeat functionality is to get users seated more quickly on a table. Furthermore the AutoSeat feature is meant to ease some of the burdens created by gaming applications on mobile devices. For example the user may normally have to navigate through a plurality of screens before sitting at a game table. This processing intensive navigation may take a considerable amount of time to complete or may cause the mobile device to freeze or time out.

The AutoSeat feature may be chosen automatically by the system using hand history saved settings or an automated procedure using certain assumptions. When the AutoSeat feature is chosen automatically by the system some amount of money calculated by the system based on personal gaming history may be taken from the user s account when the player is seated at a table.

Also the AutoSeat feature may be manually selected by a user. Referring to there are approximately nineteen steps required to open a gaming application and sit at a table with cash. The approximately nineteen steps may include 1. Select game group e.g. Cash games 2. Select game type e.g. Limit Holdem 3. Select stakes e.g. 5 10 4. Select filter to limit choice of tables 5. Sort table list by specific column 6. Scroll table list 7. Find free table 8. Highlight table 9. Select table 10. Open table 11. Check of logged in 12. Check if seat free 13. Check if enough money points for buy in 14. Time out for sitting down 15. Check blinds at table 16. Geographic preference to sit 17. How much money to take to table 18. One or more players at table and 19. Wait for blinds. In contrast to the nineteen step process described herein and depicted in the AutoSeat feature allows for seating at a table using only one step signing on.

The main motivators for the AutoSeat feature are to 1 assist users in getting a table of their choice in a large dynamic and quickly moving data set of tables or games 2 make the seating process more convenient for user 3 use history and stored information to overcome ambiguous situations on the way to getting seated 4 apply the service to a number of frontends interfaces from which the user might be accessing the networked gaming system 5 and seat a player at a table while putting a relatively small burden on a mobile device s limited memory and processing capabilities.

The AutoSeat feature may be either backend or frontend driven. The best case is a mixture with backend storing the user s preferences and the frontend executing the query through the application programming interface.

In accordance with the above description once a user has chosen a Favorites option as seen in a new screen may be displayed from which the user may select and manage favorites. is an embodiment of a new screen that opens when a user selects a Favorites option .

Naming conventions may be used to identify favorites. The following are examples of naming conventions and structures that may be taken for poker and casino games 

The structure of the favorites menu may be either in a one level list or as a multiple level i.e. sub levels list. shows a favorites list as a one level list. Several choices may be available from this favorites menu. There may be an Add a Favorite option a Manage My Favorites option an AutoSeat On Off option and zero or more selectable favorites .

When opening the mobile gaming application the favorites associated with a user s account are read from the existing favorites list of the user. If no favorites exist the favorites list may be empty. If the Autoseat On Off option is set to On then the user will be automatically seated at a table corresponding to an AutoSeat favorite. Since favorites may be stored across brand specific client applications distinct game client applications operated by the same mobile networked gaming system operator favorites may be added from each brand specific client application. If upon attempted addition of a favorite it is discovered that it already exists as a favorite then the existing favorite may just be over written.

In the case of adding a favorite especially an AutoSeat favorite upon choosing an Add a Favorite option a separate screen may open up where the user may select more criteria. In order to ensure that the table seat that the AutoSeat feature selects is to the user s liking more search criteria may be selected in addition to simply selecting the game type and stakes. Some of the possible narrowing criteria may be Game group e.g. Cash Games Jackpot Tables Sit Go and Play for Free Game Type e.g. NL Holdem Limit Holdem . . . Stakes e.g. 5 10 10 20 . . . Seats at Table 2 6 10 Players at table e.g. Number X X or more X or less Waiting Waitlist OK Waitlist not OK Hands per hour e.g. Number X X or more X or less Average pot e.g. Number X X or more X or less or Buy in Min. buy in Normal buy in Full balance .

AutoSeat favorites automatically select a game table for the user open it up buy in and sit the player down. AutoSeat is a direct favorite with additional data and procedures to directly sit down on a table and buy in. The logic of table selection in the AutoSeat feature may be taken and modified from the existing Waitlist functionality.

Referring to after choosing a Direct or AutoSeat Favorite the process of seating a player follows the sequence Connected Tables available Free tables available Buy in Sit Down .

If the mobile networked gaming system or wireless connection is not operational then the standard error popup will be displayed in case a user loses connection.

If currently no tables are available in the selected game type stake combination e.g. No Limit Hold em 5 10 a popup will come up telling the user There are currently no tables available in GAME TYPE STAKE . Please try other GAME TYPE tables. When clicking on the OK button the popup closes and the user will be taken to the GAME TYPE category which includes tables from all stakes. GAME TYPE STAKE combinations are applicable for live games and Sit Go s which use Buy ins .

If currently no tables are available in the selected game group e.g. Cash Games a popup will come up telling the user There are currently no tables available in GAME GROUP 1 . Please try GAME GROUP 2 . with GAME GROUP 1 being the game group he is looking for and GAME GROUP 2 being the other available game group game groups are Cash and Play . When clicking on the OK button the popup closes. The user will stay in his current lobby selection.

Refining criteria can be used to filter for a table of choice. Independent of the game type or stake these filters may have special behaviors if no table is found with the exact criteria.

For the refiner Average Pot Size the criteria may be X or more or X or less. If the selected average pot restriction does not retrieve any tables but tables with other values are available a popup may come up saying We did not find any tables with avg. pot SELECTED VALUE or SELECTED CONDITION LESS OR MORE . However we found similar tables with different avg. pot values. Please repeat your search again after a few seconds or take a look at the other tables we found. Clicking on Try again may trigger another lookup for the exact criteria again. View other tables will just open the according game types lobby and let the user manually go through the tables.

A refiner for Sit and Go tournaments is the buy in amount. If the selected buy in value does not retrieve any tables but tables with other values are available a popup will come up saying We did not find any tables with a BUY IN buy in however we found similar tables with different buy ins. Please repeat your search again after a few seconds or take a look at the other tables we found. Clicking on Try again may trigger another lookup for the exact criteria again. View other tables will just open the according game types lobby and let the user manually go through the tables.

For the refiner Hands per hour the criteria may be Number X X or more or X or less. If the selected hands per hour restriction does not retrieve any tables but tables with other values are available a popup will come up saying We did not find any tables with avg. pot SELECTED VALUE or SELECTED CONDITION LESS OR MORE . However we found similar tables with different hands per hour values. Please repeat your search again after a few seconds or take a look at the other tables we found. Clicking on Try again will trigger another lookup for the exact criteria again. View other tables will just open the according game types lobby and let the user manually go through the tables.

Similar messages to those above may pop up if other search criteria are not met but similar tables are available. Also if the user uses a combination of criteria for auto seating and does not get any tables the system may loosen the above criteria one by one in a pre defined order and check again for availability.

A differentiation in handling a search for free tables 73 will be required for users which are willing to be put on a wait list and users who do not. This preference may be set when adding changing a favorite. The following Table 1 lists possible scenarios based on the assumption that the system does not find any free table based on the selections done. As mentioned above STAKE can be understood as stake blinds or buy in depending on game type.

For combinations of above criteria if the user uses a combination of criteria for auto seating and does not get any free tables the system may loosen the above criteria one by one in a pre determined order and check again for availability.

If a free table fitting the exact filter of a user is found the user will be taken to the table. If more then one table fitting the exact filter of a user is found then a random selection may be used to pick the table. After above selection criteria have been run through and a table been found the table will be directly opened. Even if issues arise during sitting down the table should be open to give the user more incentive to proceed towards taking a seat. An immediate check of proper login information or sufficient balance could be done when the user triggers the direct or AutoSeat Favorite but is not chosen as it is deemed to be more important to open the table and with this give the user a graphic incentive to proceed until he sites down.

To buy in for Direct Favorites the user will take over to sit down i.e. buy in manually . For the AutoSeat feature the following three step seat taking procedure may be triggered.

Step 1 Logged in If the user is not logged in yet he will get the login dialogue for login. After successful login the user will automatically get seated. In case the user has either Auto Login activated and or Remember me the login will be done automatically by the system so the user does not have to.

Step 2 Play Money vs. Real Money user. If the system detects a Play Money user trying to log into a Real Money game the standard handling is being triggered of a popup being displayed to the user.

Step 3 Buy in. There may be three or more different buy in criteria including Minimum buy in Normal buy in Full balance or Fixed Buy in Tournament. If the user does not have enough money in his account to meet the minimum buy in criteria an error message will be triggered as seen in .

After that popup the buy in window will open and the user would be required to go to the Cashier and increase his balance. In case the user selected the Minimum Buy In option and he has the according amount in his account he will get seated properly the minimum buy in deducted from his balance and added to the table and the user may start playing.

For the Normal buy in full balance option if the user does not have the specified buy in amount but at least the minimum buy in a popup will appear with the message You have USER S BALANCE in your account. Please specify how much you want to take to the table. When clicking on OK the user may be taken to the buy in dialogue where he may specify his buy in. After that popup the buy in window will open and the user would be required to go to the Cashier and increase his balance.

For the Fixed buy in tournaments option in the user will be seated if he has sufficient funds in his account. In case he does not a popup may appear You do not have sufficient funds in your account. Please come back with the appropriate number of chips. When clicking on OK the user will get directed to the buy in dialogue where he can go to the cashier.

To sit down the user may have selected a refiner Players per seats which may refine the search based on the number of seated players at a given table taken as a ratio of the total number of seats at the table. Possible criteria for this refiner are Ratio X X or more or X or less. 

With tournaments especially Sit and Go tournaments a concern is that even if a table is listed as available in the time it takes a user to navigate to the table sit down and buy in the table has already been filled because of the large number of players trying to access that type of game. This may happen multiple times in succession and the user may become frustrated and decide to refrain from playing. The AutoSeat feature will help remedy this problem.

If the status of a tournament has changed from Registering to any other status e.g. Level 1 or first level of play the system should automatically look for a new tournament table. To avoid the user losing a seat while the system is seating him the seat should be reserved by the system at the point the free seat is found.

Furthermore a favorite may be selected to be an AutoSeat favorite. This is indicated by an AutoSeat radio button . For example in the game Poker Cash Limit Holdem 5 10 is selected to be an AutoSeat favorite as indicated by the AutoSeat radio button . In the case where are AutoSeat favorites are disabled altogether then the AutoSeat radio button may not appear on this screen.

While a favorite is highlighted the user may edit the selected favorite by the selecting Edit this Favorite . Choosing to edit a favorite s settings may take the user to another screen as seen in . In a user is editing the settings for a game Poker Cash Limit Holdem 5 10 . Several editable favorites options may be displayed. The favorites options that appear may be dependant on what game is selected. In embodiment shown in the editable favorites options are Seats Players Hands per hour Average Pot Waiting AutoSeat and Buy in. Other favorites may be displayed as would be obvious to those having ordinary skill in the art. The user can choose Save Changes to save the changes made to the settings for this favorite and may be taken back to the previous screen and may edit another favorite. The user may discard changes by choosing Cancel .

Referring back to rather than choosing to use a favorite or AutoSeat a player may choose to select a game manually via a Play for Real option or a Play for Fun option .

A user may choose to play a game for real money by choosing the Play for Real option as seen in . If the user is logged into a mobile game client application like for example a mobile poker game client application then poker games may be accessible through the Play for Real option .

Furthermore if a mobile networked gaming system wherein at least one mobile game client application lobby is associated with each of a plurality of mobile game client applications and wherein if a given mobile game client application is installed the associated mobile game client application lobby may be opened from one or more mobile game client applications. For example if a mobile game client application operator operates a plurality of game client applications i.e. a casino client a poker client a backgammon client etc. then it may be possible for a user to be able to access each of the clients via the Play for Real option . It may be further possible to have links available to the user to download other brand specific mobile game client applications offered by the operator. Also in accordance with the present invention a mobile networked gaming system wherein when any two of said mobile game client applications are designated as client X and client Y when either client X or client Y is installed a corresponding lobby X or lobby Y may open from the mobile game client application when both clients X and Y are installed a lobby which was last open when the application was running the last time may be opened from the mobile game client application and when no client is installed a predetermined lobby may be opened from the mobile game client application. For example if a user has either poker client or a casino client installed but not both then the corresponding lobby may be opened for the game client application. If a user has both a poker and a casino client installed either lobby may be accessible for the game client application preferably the last lobby that was open. Finally if a user has neither a poker nor a casino client installed a predetermined lobby may be open like for example a news or events lobby.

Referring to a poker lobby is shown following a user selection of a Play for Real option of a mobile poker client application. A mobile poker lobby may have the same characteristics as a brand specific PC based client poker lobby with the difference of the dimensions. The same error case handling can be applied as well. For easier access to the tables of choice in the limited dimensions of the mobile gaming device filters may be used. A top level filter may contain broad categories such as Cash Games Jackpot Tables Sit Go Tournaments Tournament Events or Play for Free as shown in . Second level navigation items match the secondary navigation in the brand specific client poker lobby e.g. the Cash Games top level section may include Hold em Omaha Stud and other games as shown in . A third level may contain the stakes as a refiner e.g. All 5 10 10 20 etc as shown in .

When changing the filters the selection change may be processed requested immediately thus a submit command i.e. a Run Filters button may not be required . The order of filtering is from first to third level descending i.e. the top level selection influences the second level which influences the third level which influences any other levels there may be. If the user changes the top level navigation both second level navigation items and third level may change. Initial selection in the Poker lobby may be Cash Games Limit Hold em 100 200.

Referring to vertical or horizontal scroll bars will enable the user to quickly scroll up and down the table list and also to the right via horizontal scroll bar not shown in case his window is not wide enough to display all columns. Default position of the list window will be top left of the list. The scroll bar will have the same functionality as other standard scrollbars. In case the table list is shorter then the window the scroll bar vanishes.

There may be a full table filter a radio button will let the user hide or show full tables. By default the button may be pressed and say Show full tables NO . In this case full tables are being hidden. In general all of the same filters as available in the main client should also be possible in a mobile networked gaming client application.

If there are no results available in the table list the table list may be empty just showing one entry messaging No tables available. Use the filters to find other games or check back at a later point. If tables exist but are not being shown due to an active full table filter the full table filter button deactivates and the tables will be shown even if full. The button setting is remembered and as soon as the user changes the selection the button jumps back to its settings. All fields columns can sort the table list the same way as currently a poker client lobby does. Sorting will be ascending descending fashion following the same behavior a poker client lobby has. As seen in the column H hr hands per hour has been selected and the available tables are sorted in descending order relative to hands per hour. Selecting the H hr again may change the sorting for descending to ascending order.

Referring to a user may use the keys of the mobile device to move the highlighted table up or down. When a table is highlighted a See Table Info button may appear. Also a Go To Table button may appear. Selecting the See Table Info button may open a new window visible as if above the other text on the screen as seen in . This new window may contain more detailed information about the selected table such as the usernames of the seated players and how much money each has at the table. Several options may be available including Open Table Join Waitlist or Cancel Go Back . If a user highlighted a table which he is already sitting at the Open button will de activate. The Waitlist button lets the user join a waitlist for a table.

Referring back to the rules defined for the Go to Table button apply to the Open Table option in in the information menu. Selecting either Open button will cause the user to enter the table. In case he is already on the table means the table is open playing or not the table will become active i.e. jumping in the front of the screen. Clicking on the Join Waitlist option the user will enter the table s waitlist. In case he is already on the waitlist the button will be inactive and a small icon will be messaging the fact and he will have the option to unjoin.

Navigation selection and access to the table happens in the mobile gaming application lobby. From there the table picks up the process. This implies the fact that a poker table does not need a poker client open to play. After the user double clicked or opened a table the table opens up so the user can watch the table. If the user wants to take a seat buy in and any other features are being taken over by the existing table functionality. As is the present case at this point the blocked country list will be enforced.

Referring to for tournament poker tables the fields ID Date Name Game Buy In or Plr Player may be displayed in the table list. Tournaments which are not accessible anymore to the user may display in grey color or not at all. A tournament may also be listed with a grey color if it is either a full tournament or a tournament that has already started and does not offer a late buy in. Tournaments for which the user has already registered for may be displayed in bold and feature an icon messaging confirmation and registration like a checkmark .

Tournament filter buttons may allow let the user to hide or show specific tables. These filter buttons operate similarly to those of other poker filters.

All fields in the table list can sort the table the same way as currently a poker client lobby does. Sorting will be ascending descending fashion but following the same behavior a poker client lobby has.

Referring to selecting a Tourney info option for a specific tournament may open a new window like that shown in . This new window may show more detailed tournament information such as the tournament ID the tournament s status its start time game type buy in or the number of players registered or playing.

Also a Register button lets users register for a tournament after selecting it. If a user highlighted a tourney which he is already registered for the Register button will de activate and a small icon checkmark may be messaging the fact in the table list.

Referring to a user may choose to play on a different mobile client application offered by the operator like for example a mobile casino client. shows a mobile casino client lobby. For easier access to the games of choice in the limited dimensions of a mobile device filters along the current casino navigation are used. The top level navigation may contain such general categories of games as Slots Roulette Video Poker Blackjack Caribbean Stud Let It Ride etc as shown in . The second level navigation may contain the actual games e.g. Sweet Hawaii Cash Cruise Super Fortune Wheel etc as shown in . When changing the filters the selection change may be requested immediately i.e. a submit button is not required. The default filter values may be the first selection in case the user never changed the selection before. If the user changed a selection before the default value may be the previous selection when the user comes back to that drop down.

Referring to a user may choose a Play for Fun option rather than a Play for Real option . Choosing a Play for Fun option may give the user the same general choices for game play except all the games will be for play money. As is generally the case with play money gaming applications when a user exhausts all of his play money more is deposited into the user s account at no charge.
