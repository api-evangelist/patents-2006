The present invention relates to the field of supports for medical use for the treatment of biological fluid from a patient or a donor such as the treatment for example of blood or plasma by circulation over or through a support or the therapeutic treatment of septic syndrome using a support for medical use.

This definition is extracted from the Consensus conference Sepsis Handbook R A Balk Vanderbilt University Medical Center 2001 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

More specifically the invention concerns the use of a suspension to treat a base support for medical use essentially constituted by a first polymer containing anionic or anionizable groups the suspension being in an acidic medium and comprising a second polymer containing cationic or cationizable groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the anionic or anionizable groups of the first polymer the second polymer being in the colloidal form.

The invention also pertains to a composite support comprising a base support for the treatment of a biological fluid in which 

This particular support may be constituted by a composite semi permeable membrane which can filter blood or plasma by extracorporeal circulation in particular by dialysis haemofiltration haemodiafiltration or by allowing the plasma to be treated by plasmapheresis. This composite membrane may additionally or separately act to adsorb undesirable substances from the treated fluid.

The present invention also pertains to a device for the adsorption of entities contained in a biological fluid comprising 

The term semi permeable membrane means a planar semi permeable membrane or a bundle of semi permeable hollow fibres.

The term exchanger means an exchanger for the treatment of blood or plasma by extracorporeal circulation which in general comprises two compartments separated by a semi permeable membrane each being provided with two access points a first compartment being intended for the circulation of blood or plasma from a patient and a second compartment being intended for the circulation of used liquid dialysate filtrate .

The term colloidal suspension means a suspension comprising particles of second polymer dispersed in a continuous phase preferably aqueous said suspension containing said polymer in the form of particles with a dimension of 500 nm or less in suspension in the liquid.

The term polymer in colloidal form means a polymer in the form of particles with a dimension of less than 500 nm.

The invention also envisages the use of composite membranes and supports of the invention for the manufacture of means for the therapeutic treatment of diseases linked to thrombin IRCs and afflictions suffered by intensive care patients.

An exchanger may be used for two types of treatment of renal insufficiency chronic treatment and intermittent or continuous acute treatment.

Chronic treatment is intended for patients who are usually waiting for a transplant in whom the kidneys are not functioning. Such patients undergo three or four sessions per week lasting 4 to 5 hours per session. Examples of exchangers which may be used which can be cited are those sold by the GAMBRO group comprising an AN69 ST type membrane and forming part of the Nephral ST 200 300 400 and 500 range hollow fibres with a dimension of 210 253 m with an exchange surface of 1.0 1.3 1.6 and 2.1 m .

Intermittent or continuous acute treatment is carried out for patients with severe disease such as trauma poisoning septic syndrome etc. Examples of exchangers used for acute continuous dialysis which may be cited are those sold by the GAMBRO group belonging to the Multiflow 60 100 and 150 range in Prisma and or Prismaflex sets AN69 hollow fibres with a dimension of 240 340 m and an exchange surface of 0.6 1.0 and 1.5 m .

It has been observed that the circulation especially of blood in said membrane would cause undesirable contact phase activation. The subject matter disclosed in the Applicant s European patent application EP A 0 925 626 is aimed at reducing contact phase activation of blood or plasma coming into contact with a negatively charged semi permeable membrane with an exchanger for the treatment of blood or plasma by extracorporeal circulation comprising a semi permeable membrane based on polyacrylonitrile carrying bound negative charges. That invention concerned a device for the treatment of blood or plasma by extracorporeal circulation Comprising a semi permeable membrane based on polyacrylonitrile carrying bound negative charges wherein before or after formation of the membrane at least one neutral or cationic polymer is incorporated into the membrane in a suitable quantity so as to regulate the overall ionic capacity and the electrokinetic index of the membrane in a suitable manner. The polymer may be cationic and selected from polyamines preferably from polyethyleneimines.

At the same time it was observed that there was a problem with coagulation encountered in the context of the treatment of blood or plasma from a uremic patient in which an extracorporeal blood circuit comprising a semi permeable membrane exchanger was used. To overcome this problem the Applicant s International patent application WO A 0154802 proposed binding in a stable manner to the surface of semi permeable membranes essentially constituted by a copolymer of acrylonitrile and at least one anionic and anionizable monomer an anticoagulation agent which can exert its anticoagulating activity without being leached out into the blood or plasma during treatment by extracorporeal circulation and to reduce the quantity of anticoagulation agent used systemically in the patient during an extracorporeal blood treatment session.

The invention concerned a semi permeable composite membrane comprising a semi permeable support membrane and an anticoagulation agent suitable for the treatment of blood or plasma by extracorporeal circulation said semi permeable support membrane being essentially constituted by a polyacrylonitrile carrying anionic or anionizable groups the surface of the semi permeable support membrane intended to be brought into contact with the blood or plasma was coated in succession with 

Further during the treatment of the biological fluid such as blood or plasma it was observed that certain patients could also suffer from septic syndrome. Said septic syndrome is not necessarily associated with renal insufficiency.

The origin of septic syndrome is infection with bacteria principally Gram negative releasing endotoxins lipopolysaccharides . Such endotoxins induce the synthesis of pro and anti inflammatory cytokines. The number of nosocomial infections is increasing because of the resistance of bacteria to antibiotic therapy. One of the causes of death during septic syndrome such as septic shock may be multi visceral deficiency MVD occasioned inter alia by disseminated intravascular coagulation DIVC . The prognosis for MVD accompanied by DIVC is very poor.

Currently attempts are being made to stem the bacterial infection at the origin of septic syndrome by antibiotic therapy. That technique has limitations due to problems with identification of the strains involved not to mention the major problem of the resistance of an increasing number of strains to antibiotics in particular those strains responsible for nosocomial infections.

The battle against septic syndrome also consists of administering anti inflammatory agents to patients such as anti II 1 anti TNF anti endotoxins anti PAF platelet activating factor or using steroids. Such drugs do not cause significant long term improvements in the survival rate for patients with septic syndrome.

A molecule protein C sold under the trade name XIGRIS has recently appeared on the market. The cost benefit ratio of that molecule still has to be quantified.

The quantum of the population suffering from septic syndrome is relatively high like the population suffering from renal dysfunction either spontaneous or permanent. Some of those patients may belong to both populations. The invention is applicable to any patient belonging to the entire group of the two populations.

Under these circumstances one of the essential aims of the invention is the development of novel technical means for therapeutic treatments for septic syndrome in particular to help or even cure patients and to reduce mortality in said patients in recovery.

Another essential aim of the invention is to provide novel technical means for the therapeutic treatment of septic syndrome which is substantially more effective and cheaper than known means.

In a further essential aspect the invention provides novel technical means intended if necessary at the same time for the therapeutic treatment of septic syndrome and to purify biological fluids such as blood plasma or other liquids which may be injected into a patient. The blood treatment may in particular correspond to the treatment of renal insufficiency.

In a yet still further aspect the invention provides a composite support for the effective adsorption of mediators involved in septic syndrome endotoxins cytokines anaphylatoxins etc .

In a still further aspect the invention provides a composite support intended if necessary at the same time for the treatment of septic syndrome and to purify biological fluids such as blood plasma or other liquids which are capable of being injected into a patient.

In a further essential aspect the invention provides a multifunctional composite support intended if necessary at the same time for the treatment of septic syndrome and renal insufficiency in particular by haemodialysis ultrafiltration haemofiltration and or haemodiafiltration .

In a further aspect the invention provides a composite support which is effective in adsorbing mediators involved in septic syndrome and if necessary having an anti thrombogenic nature which can avoid increased systemic anticoagulation in the case of the injection of an anticoagulation agent during treatment via the membrane.

In a further aspect the invention provides a composite support which is effective in adsorbing mediators involved in septic syndrome and if necessary having an anti thrombogenic nature allowing the quantity of anticoagulation agents injected into a patient during an extracorporeal blood or plasma treatment session to be significantly reduced or even dispensed with.

In a still further aspect the invention provides an improvement to the semi permeable membrane and exchanger of WO A 01 54802 ensuring an excellent adsorption capacity for undesirable substances contained in the biological fluid intended to be filtered through said membrane.

In a still further aspect the invention provides an improvement to the semi permeable membrane and exchanger of WO A 01 54802 ensuring a larger quantity of anticoagulation agents grafted onto the membrane before the treatment.

A semi permeable membrane based on polyacrylonitrile carrying bound negative charges is known in which before or after forming the membrane a cationic polymer is incorporated into the membrane in a suitable quantity and manner. The polymer may be selected from polyamines preferably from polyethyleneimines. Said membrane can eliminate undesirable substances present in the blood of a patient suffering from renal insufficiency.

The inventor sought to provide a medical device having an adsorption capacity for endotoxins and other agents responsible for septic syndrome. It was observed that certain of those agents carry anionic or anionizable groups. The invention elected to operate using a mode of treatment which differed from existing modes drugs etc and to work on a support for medical use which would be rendered capable of adsorbing such agents.

Starting from that choice and the support described in EP A 0 925 626 the inventor knew of a semi permeable membrane based on polyacrylonitrile carrying bound negative charges in which before or after forming the membrane a cationic polymer was incorporated into the membrane in a quantity that could regulate the overall ionic capacity and the electrokinetic index of the membrane in a suitable manner. The polymer could be selected from polyamines preferably from polyethyleneimines PEI . That membrane could only purify blood.

Further it was known that protonation of the cationic polymer is encouraged once the pH of the cationic polymer solution is acidic. In fact the more acidic the pH the greater the protonation.

However the inventor observed that under such conditions the surface density of the cationic polymer at the surface of the membrane comprising an anionic polymer is very low of the order of 1 mg m.

This fact could be attributed to the steric hindrance of the cationic polymer molecules in an acidic medium. In this case the skilled person seeking to bind a maximum amount of cationic polymer on the base membrane comprising a polymer carrying anionic groups would not be led to use the cationic polymer in an acidic medium as while the cationic polymer protonation is suitable the surface density in contrast is too low and the entities containing anionic or anionizable groups could not be grafted to the cationic or cationic groups of the polymer in large quantities.

Alternatively using a cationic polymer in a basic medium the inventor observed a higher surface density at a value close to 10 mg m which was insufficient to allow binding of a large number of anionic or anionizable groups of the polymer to be grafted onto the base membrane. Certainly the surface density increased compared with the acidic medium but the degree of protonation and thus the number of free cationic or cationizable groups was limited.

There was no indication that the pH could be adjusted during manufacture of such a medical device and even less indication regarding selecting between an acidic or basic pH to satisfy the envisaged aims. Consequently the skilled person was no longer tempted to work with such a support.

Surprisingly the inventor observed that the use of a solution of a polymer carrying anionic or anionizable groups in the colloidal form and in an acidic medium in particular by mixing for example a solution of polymer carrying anionic or anionizable groups with a solution of organic polyacid in a specific proportion with respect to said polymer results in a considerable increase in both the quantity of polymer grafted to the surface of the membrane and the availability of free cationic or cationizable groups at the surface of this membrane coating and thus allows a very large quantity of entity ies carrying anionic or anionizable groups to be bound.

In subsequent tests the inventor confirmed that the use of polymer carrying cationic groups employed in the colloidal form does not modify the existing properties of the known support.

Thus the inventor developed the use of a polymer carrying cationic or cationizable groups on a support for medical use essentially constituted by a polymer carrying anionic or anionizable groups and being in the colloidal form in an acidic medium. The inventor has consequently developed novel therapeutic means constituted by a multifunctional adsorption support grafted in a stable manner and inter alia offering effective capacities for endotoxin adsorption and for inhibiting other compounds responsible for coagulation disorder thrombin these disorders occurring for example in a septic syndrome.

It is assumed that these results are obtained because of particular mutual molecular arrangement of the molecules of the second polymer and or of the molecules of the second polymer with respect to the molecules of the structure of the first polymer. The particular mutual molecular arrangement of the molecules of the second polymer and or the quantity of molecules of the second polymer are due at least to the colloidal form of the second polymer.

Thus the inventor achieves the aims mentioned above inter alia by dint of the use of a suspension to treat a base support for medical use essentially constituted by a first polymer containing anionic or anionizable groups the suspension being in an acidic medium and comprising a second polymer containing cationic or cationizable groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the anionic or anionizable groups of the first polymer the second polymer being in the colloidal form.

Said use may result in a composite support comprising a base support for the treatment of a biological fluid in which the base support is essentially constituted by a first polymer carrying anionic or anionizable groups at least a part of the surface of the base support is coated with a second polymer ionically bonded to the first polymer the second polymer carrying cationic or cationizable groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the anionic or anionizable groups of the first polymer 

in which the second polymer is in the colloidal form allowing the composite membrane to adsorb at least one entity containing anionic or anionizable groups by bonding with cationic or cationizable groups of the second polymer.

Said novel support has proved particularly suitable when acting as an adsorbent when it is brought into the presence of or into contact with the blood or plasma from patients with the pathologies discussed above by extracorporeal circulation.

In addition the portion of the surface of the support may be at least a partially coated with at least one anticoagulation agent carrying anionic or anionizable groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the cationic or cationizable groups of the second polymer.

Said novel multifunctional support with as a structure a first polymer coated with a high surface density intermediate layer of a second polymer is integral in a highly stable manner with an outer layer of anticoagulation agent.

The invention also concerns a method for manufacturing a composite support for the treatment of biological fluid said method comprising the following steps 

The invention also concerns a method for manufacturing an exchanger for the treatment of a biological liquid the exchanger comprising a housing defining a first compartment and a second compartment the first compartment being provided with an inlet and an outlet and being intended for the circulation of biological liquid to be treated the second compartment being intended for the circulation of dialysate or filtrate and being provided with an outlet and optionally with an inlet the two compartments being separated by a base support the method comprising the following steps

b3 in the case in which steps b1 b2 are carried out after step a2 rinsing and or purging the exchanger of the solution containing the second polymer 

The use of the invention also results in a device for adsorbing entities contained in a biological fluid comprising 

For this reason the invention also concerns a method for manufacturing a medical device for the adsorption of entities contained in a biological fluid for the treatment of a biological liquid the device comprising a housing provided with an inlet and an outlet and being intended for the circulation of biological liquid to be treated and a composite support in accordance with the invention the method comprising the following steps 

a1 providing a base support essentially constituted from a first polymer carrying anionic or anionizable groups 

a2 assembling the various components of the device in particular mounting the base support in the housing 

b1 providing a suspension in an acidic medium containing a second polymer carrying cationic or cationizable groups which can form an ionic bond with the anionic or anionizable groups of the first polymer the second polymer being in the colloidal form 

b2 bringing the suspension into contact with at least a first part of the base support intended to be brought into contact with the liquid to be treated 

b3 in the case in which steps b1 b2 are carried out after step a2 rinsing and or purging the adsorption device of the solution containing the second polymer 

It should be recalled that the invention concerns the use of a suspension to treat a base support for medical use essentially constituted by a first polymer containing anionic or anionizable groups the suspension being in an acidic medium and comprising a second polymer containing cationic or cationizable groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the anionic or anionizable groups of the first polymer the second polymer being in the colloidal form.

The suspension of the second polymer comprises at least one organic polyacid in association with the second polymer allowing the second polymer to take said colloidal form.

The organic polyacid may be a polycarboxylic acid in particular comprising at least three carboxylic acid groups preferably an organic tribasic acid. The polycarboxylic acid in the preferred implementation is citric acid.

Advantageously the anionic or anionizable groups of the first polymer are selected from the following groups sulphonic phosphonic carboxylic sulphuric and phosphoric and from salts of said groups.

More preferably the anionic or anionizable groups of the first polymer are acidic sulphonic groups or sulphonic groups in their salt form.

Finally in a preferred implementation of the invention the first polymer comprises a polyacrylonitrile preferably a copolymer of acrylonitrile and sodium methallyl sulphonate.

Still more preferably the second polymer P2 is a cationic polymer selected from polyamines preferably cationic polyaminoacids and or from polyimines and more preferably still from the group comprising polylysine polyarginine polyethyleneimine PEI their copolymers and their mixtures.

According to one characteristic of the invention the molecular mass of the second polymer may be greater than the cutoff threshold of the support membrane constituted by the first polymer P1 .

According to a subsequent characteristic of the invention the second polymer may comprise chains of sufficient size not to traverse the base support. Thus the second polymer before being placed into the colloidal form may comprise chains with sufficient size steric hindrance not to traverse the base support comprising the first polymer. This allows it to be bound essentially to the surface of the support essentially constituted by the first polymer by ionic bonding. Consequently the quantity of second polymer necessary to treat the surface of the base membrane comprising P1 is moderate when a bulk treatment of the base membrane comprising the first polymer by penetration of the second polymer inside the base membrane comprising the first polymer is not sought. This characteristic is not necessarily useful when a bulk treatment by the second polymer is carried out in addition to the surface treatment of the base support.

The fact that P2 has a molecular mass which is greater than or equal to the cutoff threshold of the membrane may also be an important parameter as regards producing the desired properties in the composite membrane.

Preferably the second polymer is prepared by ultrafiltration of a solution of the second polymer through a semi permeable membrane having a cutoff threshold which is greater than or equal to that of a support for example a semi permeable membrane essentially constituted by the first polymer. This allows chains of the second polymer below a certain size corresponding to the porosity of the base support to be eliminated. This preparation mode by ultrafiltration is shown in .

However this parameter may not be necessary as when the second polymer of any molecular size is taken into colloidal form the size of the aggregates of polymer increases and the size obtained may then be sufficient not to pass through the base support. This can avoid a step for selecting the molecular size of the second polymer.

The composite support comprises a base support for the treatment of a biological fluid in which the base support is essentially constituted by a first polymer carrying anionic or anionizable groups at least a part of the surface of the base support is coated with a second polymer ionically bonded to the first polymer the second polymer carrying cationic or cationizable groups which can form an ionic bond with the anionic or anionizable groups of the first polymer the second polymer being in the colloidal form. The inventor has surprisingly observed that this colloidal form allows the composite membrane to adsorb at least one entity containing anionic or anionizable groups by bonding with cationic or cationizable groups of the second polymer.

The composite support comprises a second polymer which may be in association with an organic polyacid as defined above.

To obtain the colloidal suspension it is advantageous to carefully select the ratio of the concentration of the second polymer and the organic polyacid.

The ratio of the concentration of the second polymer in the suspension to the concentration of organic polyacid in the suspension is such that it can produce a suspension in the colloidal form. As an example in the implementation in which the second polymer is polyethyleneimine and the polyacid is citric acid said ratio of the concentration for PEI and citric acid is in the range 0.9 to 1.1.

The composite support of the invention may comprise said part of the surface of the support at least a partially coated with at least one anticoagulation agent carrying anionic or anionizable groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the cationic or cationizable groups of the second polymer.

The anticoagulation agent may comprise at least one compound of the glycoaminoglycanes family having an anticoagulation activity said anticoagulation agent preferably being selected from the group comprising non fractionated heparin fractionated heparin danaparoids all heparin derivatives and mixtures of said products.

Clearly the anticoagulation agent must not be toxic. Non fractionated heparin is particularly preferred.

The surface concentration of the deposited anticoagulation agent may be in the range 1000 to 30000 IU m preferably in the range 2000 to 8000 IU mof membrane limits included .

The composite support of the invention has a surface concentration for the second polymer in the colloidal form in the range 15 to 200 mg m preferably in the range 15 to 100 and more preferably in the range 15 to 95 mg m.

In a first implementation of the invention the composite support may have a semi permeable base membrane as the base support.

Thus the molecular mass of the second polymer may be greater than the cutoff threshold of the semi permeable membrane made with the first polymer.

Such a composite support with a base support as a semi permeable membrane can be termed a composite membrane and will be of use for the purification by extracorporeal circulation of blood or plasma as it comprises at least a first part of the surface intended to be brought into contact with blood or plasma and a second part of the surface intended to be brought into contact with the dialysate or the filtrate. The first part of the surface of the membrane may be covered by the second polymer in the colloidal form and optionally by an anticoagulation agent carrying anionic or anionizable groups which can form an ionic bond with the cationic or cationizable groups of the second polymer.

In this mode at least the second portion of the surface of the membrane intended to be brought into contact with the dialysate or filtrate may be covered with the second polymer in the colloidal form. It may then optionally be covered by an anticoagulation agent carrying anionic or anionizable groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the cationic or cationizable groups of the second polymer.

A preferred mode is the first part of the surface of the membrane is covered by the second polymer in the colloidal form and the anticoagulation agent carrying anionic or anionizable groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the cationic or cationizable groups of the second polymer and in combination the second part of the surface of the membrane is covered by the second polymer in the colloidal form.

The second polymer in the colloidal form for the second part of the surface may have a molecular size which is over a certain threshold.

Alternatively it is also possible to envisage covering the second part of the surface with the second polymer which is not in the colloidal form and or which has a molecular size above a cutoff threshold for the membrane of the first polymer.

The composite membrane coated solely with a second polymer in the colloidal form on the first surface blood face and on the second surface filtrate or dialysate face is a membrane which is termed a colloidal bi face membrane.

Said multifunctional membrane can adsorb endotoxins which are the source of septic syndrome it can reduce contact phase activation and it can adsorb an anticoagulation agent grafted on during manufacture just before blood treatment or injected into the patient during the blood treatment.

The semi permeable membrane is a stack in the form of planar membranes or it is constituted by a bundle of hollow fibres.

In the case of a bundle of hollow fibres the interior surface of the hollow fibres is the first part of the surface intended to come into contact with the blood or plasma and the exterior surface of the hollow fibres is the second part of the surface intended to be brought into contact with the filtrate or the dialysate.

In the context of the preferred implementation of a semi permeable membrane the first polymer may for example be a copolymer of acrylonitrile and sodium methallylsulphonate such as the copolymer with the trade name AN69 manufactured by GAMBRO INDUSTRIES with which the best performances have been achieved. In the same manner the second polymer is preferably a PEI since the anticoagulation agent is heparin. The composite semi permeable membrane of this preferred implementation of the invention has an effective anticoagulation activity during a treatment or plasma blood session using extracorporeal circulation ECC . Further the anticoagulation agent for example heparin is bound in a stable manner to the structure of the first polymer covered with the second polymer in the colloidal form.

In a second alternative implementation to a semi permeable membrane as the base support the support may comprise a base support constituted by one of the following forms an assembly of beads a foam or a gel.

In a first implementation said base support may be manufactured in a first step and then treated during a second step with the suspension of the second polymer in the colloidal form. Treatment with the suspension may be carried out on the surface more particularly on the apparent surface i.e. the apparent visible surface but also optionally on the developed surface i.e. on the apparent surface and the surface presented by the pores inside the base support .

In the case in which the apparent surface alone is treated this is termed the surface treatment of the first polymer. In the case in which the apparent and developed surfaces are treated this is termed the bulk treatment of the first polymer.

In a second alternative implementation said support may be manufactured by simultaneously mixing the first polymer with a suspension of the second polymer in the colloidal form. This is termed the bulk treatment of the first polymer this mode can bind the second polymer both to the apparent surface and to the developed surface.

Such a support in one of the two implementations is placed in a housing comprising an inlet to introduce the biological fluid to be treated and an outlet to allow the treated fluid to leave. Said support is capable of adsorbing entities of the fluid carrying anionic or anionizable groups by ionic bonding.

In this mode in addition to being on the apparent surface the second polymer in the colloidal form may also be present in the bulk of the base support for example in the bulk of the foam or in the bulk of the beads.

In this case the quantity of bound second polymer in the colloidal form will depend on the porosity of the support.

The composite support of the invention has an endotoxin adsorption capacity O55 B5 expressed in EU mand measured using method M described below of 500 EU m preferably 1500 EU mor more.

Method M circulation closed circuit 500 ml at flow rate of 300 ml min in the blood compartment of a hollow fibre dialyzer of physiological serum containing 10 EU ml of Escherichia Coli O55 B5 endotoxins. Endotoxin assay by Limulus LAL test.

In addition to the adsorption capacity the binding or grafting stability of the anticoagulation agent on the structure of the first polymer P1 coated with the second polymer P2 is also one of the essential parameters of the present invention.

This anticoagulation agent grafting stability may be established by means of the coagulation time given by the CKT.

Thus the support of the invention preferably has a CKT which does not significantly increase approximately 10 with respect to the initial value over at least 6 hours in a test during an ECC extracorporeal circulation as described in the description.

The CKT determines the extension in the coagulation time of a citrated plasma caused by a deficiency of certain coagulation factors or by the presence of an anticoagulation agent such as heparin. In this latter case the extension of the coagulation time is proportional to the quantity of heparin present.

Determining the CKT can thus indicate the level of anticoagulation agent in the blood. The method for measuring this coagulation time expressed in seconds is known it is carried out after recalcification and adding an activator. As an example a hollow fibre dialyzer trade name FILTRAL 16 produced by GAMBRO INDUSTRIES France is used provided with a useful membrane surface area of 1.6 m of AN69 P1 copolymer of acrylonitrile and sodium methallyl and coated on its two faces with P2 PEI then with anticoagulation agent heparin.

An extracorporeal blood circuit including the dialyzer is then connected to the vascular system of a sheep. No anticoagulation agent is injected into the sheep s blood.

The properties of the composite support of the invention are at least partially determined by the method by which it is obtained which may be assimilated with at least one surface treatment.

The method for manufacturing a composite support for the treatment of biological fluid comprises the following steps 

In accordance with one characteristic of the invention the second polymer is obtained in the colloidal form by a step for mixing a first solution comprising the second polymer with a second solution comprising at least one organic polyacid. Said polyacid may be as defined above.

According to one characteristic of the invention the ratio of the concentration of the second polymer in the suspension to the concentration of organic polyacid in the suspension is such that it can produce a suspension in the colloidal form.

If the second polymer is polyethyleneimine and the polyacid is citric acid said ratio of the concentration for PEI and citric acid is in the range 0.9 to 1.1.

In accordance with one characteristic of the invention the method comprises after step c a step d which is as follows bringing at least a portion of said part of the surface of the base support into contact with a solution comprising at least one anticoagulation agent carrying anionic or anionizable groups which are capable of forming an ionic bond with the cationic or cationizable groups of the second polymer to bind an anticoagulating coating onto a portion of said part of the surface of the support coated with the second polymer.

Said step d is carried out just before using a composite support for the treatment of biological fluid extemporaneously or during the manufacture of the composite support.

When the anticoagulation agent is grafted just before the treatment it may be carried out during rinsing or priming of the filter by passing a preparation liquid through the entire circuit composed of composite support.

In accordance with a further characteristic of the invention the method comprises as a final optional manufacturing step a step for sterilization of the support. Sterilization may be gamma sterilization or sterilization using ethylene oxide which may or may not be preceded by gamma irradiation or using techniques which are well known to the skilled person.

The first solution comprising the second polymer may be prepared by ultrafiltration of a solution of the second polymer through a semi permeable membrane to eliminate chains of the second polymer with a size which is less than or equal to the size corresponding to the porosity of the base support.

Further treatment by the suspension in an acidic medium of the second polymer in the colloidal form may be carried out in at least a part of the bulk of the base support.

In the context of the invention the term colloidal suspension means a suspension comprising particles of second polymer dispersed in a continuous phase preferably aqueous. The size of said particles of second polymer mean diameter is 500 nm or less as an example in the range 10 to 500 nm preferably in the range 50 to 200 nm or even in the range 80 to 120 nm for example of the order of 100 nm.

In the case in which P1 is a copolymer of polyacrylonitrile and sodium methallylsulphonate the structure based on P1 may optionally be de glycerined before the surface treatment aimed at binding the P2 coating in step c and the anticoagulation treatment in step d . For deglycerination an aqueous liquid is circulated.

In accordance with a further characteristic of the invention the compartments of the exchanger are also separated by a setting mass based on an appropriate adhesive composition intended to form depending on the case 

Advantageously the exchanger of the invention has a volume or an exchange surface of about 200 cmor more and less than about 4 m preferably for an adult in the range from about 0.6 mto 2 m.

Preferably the exchanger which comprises the composite semi permeable membrane i.e. the support of the invention is sterilized and ready to use. Thus it does not require any special manipulation by the consumers.

The present invention also pertains to a method for manufacturing an exchanger for the treatment of a biological liquid the exchanger comprising a housing defining a first compartment and a second compartment the first compartment being provided with an inlet and an outlet and being intended for the circulation of biological liquid to be treated the second compartment being intended for the circulation of dialysate or filtrate and being provided with an outlet and optionally with an inlet the two compartments being separated by a base support the method comprising the following steps

Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following examples.

See FR B 2 804 328 in particular for the preparation and characterization of this PEI. Said method for preparing a cationic polymer in this case a polyethyleneimine PEI aiming at eliminating by fractionation the smallest chains of polymers with a low steric hindrance which may penetrate into the pores of the semi permeable membrane to be treated and traverse it. shows the procedure for preparing PEI which comprises the following steps a preparation in a tank of a solution of 1.5 litres of a solution of PEI with a mass average molecular mass of 750 kdalton LUPASOL P from BASF 50 g per litre in distilled water b circulation in a closed circuit of said solution in the blood compartment of a dialyzer with hollow fibres trade name FILTRAL 16 manufactured by GAMBRO INDUSTRIES France provided with a membrane useful surface 1.6 m formed from AN69 copolymer of acrylonitrile and sodium methallylsulphonate at a flow rate of 300 ml per minute c simultaneously with step b ultrafiltration at a flow rate of 60 ml per minute adding water to tank at the same flow rate.

Methods circulation closed circuit 500 ml at a flow rate of 300 ml min in the blood compartment of heparinated human plasma 10 IU ml containing 1 EU ml of Escherichia Coli O55 B5 endotoxins.

At regular time intervals the amount of endotoxins in the plasma was measured LAL test for a negative control constituted by an M100 exchanger not treated with PEI and heparin in accordance with the invention and for the exchanger of the invention the preparation of which is described above. The results are shown in .

The results are given in from which it will be observed that all of the haemodynamic parameters move in the direction of an improvement in the condition of the animal.

As a supplemental result of this test shows the blood concentration of cytokines compared at the end of treatment. These results demonstrate that the concentrations of the 4 cytokines measured namely II1B I1ra TNF and 116 are advantageously lower in the pigs treated in accordance with the invention.

Methods circulation closed circuit 500 ml at a flow rate of 300 ml min for 2 hours in the blood compartment of water containing 10 EU ml of Escherichia Coli O55 B5 endotoxins.

It will be observed that the endotoxin adsorption capacity for Example 2 is much higher than that of the reference product which was not treated in accordance with the invention.

Circulation closed circuit 2000 ml at a flow rate of 300 ml min for 2 hours in the blood compartment of the product of water containing 10 EU ml of 55 B5 endotoxins.

It will be observed that the endotoxin adsorption capacity for Example 3 is much higher than that of the reference product which was not treated in accordance with the invention and also higher than that of Example 2 as more PEI had been adsorbed.

As will be observed in an exchanger in accordance with the present invention comprises a semi permeable membrane such as a bundle of hollow fibres which is disposed in a tubular housing in which it is secured at its two ends by partition in the form of a disk . In addition to the fact that the fibres are bonded to each other the disks act to define in the tubular housing a sealed compartment to which two connectors perpendicular to the axis of the housing provide access. A cap is fixed at each end of the housing said cap comprising an 8 axial access connector . The two connectors are symmetrical. The blood compartment of the device of the invention is constituted by the interior space defined between each bonding disk and the cap closing the corresponding end of the tubular housing and by the interior of the hollow fibres. The compartment intended for the filtrate is constituted by the space accessed by the two connectors perpendicular to the axis of the housing and includes the exterior of the hollow fibres.

For the examples with a solution of PEI at a pH of 5 adjusted with HCI 8 adjusted with NaOH and 11 adjusted with NaOH respectively it was observed that the adsorbed PEI did not exceed 10 mg m. It was interesting to observe as stated above that the higher the pH more basic the greater the adsorption of PEI and this would lead the skilled person for a solution with a given concentration of PEI to use a high pH to adsorb more PEI.

For the same pH it was observed that when the concentration of the PEI solution increased the adsorption of PEI increased but not significantly. Adsorption of a colloidal solution of PEI mixed with citric acid 

In contrast for a colloidal suspension of PEI mixed with citric acid test mixture in a weight ratio of 1 for PEI and citric acid it was surprisingly observed that the quantity of adsorbed PEI increased significantly with the concentration of PEI in the solution. Using a suspension of PEI mixed with citric acid in acidic medium increased the adsorption of PEI although the skilled person would know that more PEI would be adsorbed by the membrane in a basic medium.
