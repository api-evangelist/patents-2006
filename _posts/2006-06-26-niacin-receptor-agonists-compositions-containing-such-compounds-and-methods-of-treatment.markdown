This application is a 371 National Stage Application of PCT US2006 024740 filed on Jun. 26 2006 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 694 711 filed on Jun. 28 2005.

The present invention relates to cycloalkene compounds their derivatives compositions containing such compounds and methods of treatment or prevention in a mammal relating to dyslipidemias. Dyslipidemia is a condition wherein serum lipids are abnormal. Elevated cholesterol and low levels of high density lipoprotein HDL are independent risk factors for atherosclerosis associated with a greater than normal risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Factors known to affect serum cholesterol include genetic predisposition diet body weight degree of physical activity age and gender. While cholesterol in normal amounts is a vital building block for cell membranes and essential organic molecules such as steroids and bile acids cholesterol in excess is known to contribute to cardiovascular disease. For example cholesterol through its relationship with foam cells is a primary component of plaque which collects in coronary arteries resulting in the cardiovascular disease termed atherosclerosis.

Traditional therapies for reducing cholesterol include medications such as statins which reduce production of cholesterol by the body . More recently the value of nutrition and nutritional supplements in reducing blood cholesterol has received significant attention. For example dietary compounds such as soluble fiber vitamin E soy garlic omega 3 fatty acids and niacin have all received significant attention and research funding.

Niacin or nicotinic acid pyridine 3 carboxylic acid is a drug that reduces coronary events in clinical trials. It is commonly known for its effect in elevating serum levels of high density lipoproteins HDL . Importantly niacin also has a beneficial effect on other lipid profiles. Specifically it reduces low density lipoproteins LDL very low density lipoproteins VLDL and triglycerides TG . However the clinical use of nicotinic acid is limited by a number of adverse side effects including cutaneous vasodilation sometimes called flushing.

Despite the attention focused on traditional and alternative means for controlling serum cholesterol serum triglycerides and the like a significant portion of the population has total cholesterol levels greater than about 200 mg dL and are thus candidates for dyslipidemia therapy. There thus remains a need in the art for compounds compositions and alternative methods of reducing total cholesterol serum triglycerides and the like and raising HDL.

The present invention relates to compounds that have been discovered to have effects in modifying serum lipid levels.

The invention thus provides compositions for effecting reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and raising HDL in accordance with the methods described.

Consequently one object of the present invention is to provide a nicotinic acid receptor agonist that can be used to treat dyslipidemias atherosclerosis diabetes metabolic syndrome and related conditions while minimizing the adverse effects that are associated with niacin treatment.

The invention is described herein in detail using the terms defined below unless otherwise specified.

 Alkyl as well as other groups having the prefix alk such as alkoxy alkanoyl and the like means carbon chains which may be linear branched or cyclic or combinations thereof containing the indicated number of carbon atoms. If no number is specified 1 6 carbon atoms are intended for linear and 3 7 carbon atoms for branched alkyl groups. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl ethyl propyl isopropyl butyl sec and tert butyl pentyl hexyl heptyl octyl nonyl and the like. Cycloalkyl is a subset of alkyl if no number of atoms is specified 3 7 carbon atoms are intended forming 1 3 carbocyclic rings that are fused. Cycloalkyl also includes monocyclic rings fused to an aryl group in which the point of attachment is on the non aromatic portion. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl cyclobutyl cyclopentyl cyclohexyl cycloheptyl tetrahydronaphthyl decahydronaphthyl indanyl and the like. Haloalkoxy and haloOalkyl are used interchangeably and refer to halo substituted alkyl groups linked through the oxygen atom. Haloalkyl and haloalkoxy include mono substituted as well as multiple substituted alkyl and alkoxy groups up to perhalo substituted alkyl and alkoxy. For example trifluoromethyl and trifluoromethoxy are included.

 Alkenyl means carbon chains which contain at least one carbon carbon double bond and which may be linear or branched or combinations thereof. Examples of alkenyl include vinyl allyl isopropenyl pentenyl hexenyl heptenyl 1 propenyl 2 butenyl 2 methyl 2 butenyl and the like.

 Alkynyl means carbon chains which contain at least one carbon carbon triple bond and which may be linear or branched or combinations thereof. Examples of alkynyl include ethynyl propargyl 3 methyl 1 pentynyl 2 heptynyl and the like.

 Aryl Ar means mono and bicyclic aromatic rings containing 6 10 carbon atoms. Examples of aryl include phenyl naphthyl indenyl and the like.

 Heteroaryl HAR unless otherwise specified means mono bicyclic and tricyclic aromatic ring systems containing at least one heteroatom selected from O S S O SOand N with each ring containing 5 to 6 atoms. HAR groups may contain from 5 14 preferably 5 13 atoms. Examples include but are not limited to pyrrolyl isoxazolyl isothiazolyl pyrazolyl pyridyl oxazolyl oxadiazolyl thiadiazolyl thiazolyl imidazolyl triazolyl tetrazolyl furanyl triazinyl thienyl pyrimidyl pyridazinyl pyrazinyl benzoxazolyl benzothiazolyl benzimidazolyl benzofuranyl benzothiophenyl benzopyrazolyl benzotriazolyl furo 2 3 b pyridyl benzoxazinyl tetrahydrohydroquinolinyl tetrahydroisoquinolinyl quinolyl isoquinolyl indolyl dihydroindolyl quinoxalinyl quinazolinyl naphthyridinyl pteridinyl 2 3 dihydrofuro 2 3 b pyridyl and the like. Heteroaryl also includes aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic groups fused to heterocycles that are non aromatic or partially aromatic and optionally containing a carbonyl. Examples of additional heteroaryl groups include indolinyl dihydrobenzofuranyl dihydrobenzothiophenyl dihydrobenzoxazolyl and aromatic heterocyclic groups fused to cycloalkyl rings. Examples also include the following 

 Heterocyclyl Hetcy unless otherwise specified means mono and bicyclic saturated and partially saturated rings and ring systems containing at least one heteroatom selected from N S and O each of said ring having from 3 to 10 atoms in which the point of attachment may be carbon or nitrogen. Examples of heterocyclyl include but are not limited to azetidinyl pyrrolidinyl piperidinyl piperazinyl imidazolidinyl tetrahydrofuranyl 1 4 dioxanyl morpholinyl thiomorpholinyl tetrahydrothienyl and the like. Heterocycles can also exist in tautomeric forms e.g. 2 and 4 pyridones. Heterocycles moreover includes such moieties in charged form e.g. piperidinium.

The phrase in the absence of substantial flushing refers to the side effect that is often seen when nicotinic acid is administered in therapeutic amounts. The flushing effect of nicotinic acid usually becomes less frequent and less severe as the patient develops tolerance to the drug at therapeutic doses but the flushing effect still occurs to some extent and can be transient. Thus in the absence of substantial flushing refers to the reduced severity of flushing when it occurs or fewer flushing events than would otherwise occur. Preferably the incidence of flushing relative to niacin is reduced by at least about a third more preferably the incidence is reduced by half and most preferably the flushing incidence is reduced by about two thirds or more. Likewise the severity relative to niacin is preferably reduced by at least about a third more preferably by at least half and most preferably by at least about two thirds. Clearly a one hundred percent reduction in flushing incidence and severity is most preferable but is not required.

Representative examples of species that are of interest are shown below in Table I. Within this subset of compounds all other variables are as originally defined with respect to formula I.

Many of the compounds of formula I contain asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures single enantiomers diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. All such isomeric forms are included.

Moreover chiral compounds possessing one stereocenter of general formula I may be resolved into their enantiomers in the presence of a chiral environment using methods known to those skilled in the art. Chiral compounds possessing more than one stereocenter may be separated into their diastereomers in an achiral environment on the basis of their physical properties using methods known to those skilled in the art. Single diastereomers that are obtained in racemic form may be resolved into their enantiomers as described above.

If desired racemic mixtures of compounds may be separated so that individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds of Formula I to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture which is then separated into individual diastereomers by standard methods such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to substantially pure enantiomers by cleaving the added chiral residue from the diastereomeric compound.

The racemic mixture of the compounds of Formula I can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases which methods are well known in the art.

Alternatively enantiomers of compounds of the general Formula I may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents.

Some of the compounds described herein exist as tautomers which have different points of attachment for hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example a ketone and its enol form are keto enol tautomers. Or for example a 2 hydroxyquinoline can reside in the tautomeric 2 quinolone form. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are included.

The dosages of compounds of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof vary within wide limits. The specific dosage regimen and levels for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age body weight general health sex diet time of administration route of administration rate of excretion drug combination and the severity of the patient s condition. Consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Generally the compounds will be administered in amounts ranging from as low as about 0.01 mg day to as high as about 2000 mg day in single or divided doses. A representative dosage is about 0.1 mg day to about 1 g day. Lower dosages can be used initially and dosages increased to further minimize any untoward effects. It is expected that the compounds described herein will be administered on a daily basis for a length of time appropriate to treat or prevent the medical condition relevant to the patient including a course of therapy lasting months years or the life of the patient.

One or more additional active agents may be administered with the compounds described herein. The additional active agent or agents can be lipid modifying compounds or agents having other pharmaceutical activities or agents that have both lipid modifying effects and other pharmaceutical activities.

Cholesterol absorption inhibitors can also be used in the present invention. Such compounds block the movement of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen into enterocytes of the small intestinal wall thus reducing serum cholesterol levels. Examples of cholesterol absorption inhibitors are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 846 966 5 631 365 5 767 115 6 133 001 5 886 171 5 856 473 5 756 470 5 739 321 5 919 672 and in PCT application Nos. WO 00 63703 WO 00 60107 WO 00 38725 WO 00 34240 WO 00 20623 WO 97 45406 WO 97 16424 WO 97 16455 and WO 95 08532. The most notable cholesterol absorption inhibitor is ezetimibe also known as 1 4 fluorophenyl 3 R 3 S 4 fluorophenyl 3 hydroxypropyl 4 S 4 hydroxyphenyl 2 azetidinone described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 767 115 and 5 846 966.

Therapeutically effective amounts of cholesterol absorption inhibitors include dosages of from about 0.01 mg kg to about 30 mg kg of body weight per day preferably about 0.1 mg kg to about 15 mg kg.

For diabetic patients the compounds used in the present invention can be administered with conventional diabetic medications. For example a diabetic patient receiving treatment as described herein may also be taking insulin or an oral antidiabetic medication. One example of an oral antidiabetic medication useful herein is metformin.

In the event that these niacin receptor agonists induce some degree of vasodilation it is understood that the compounds of formula I may be co dosed with a vasodilation suppressing agent. Consequently one aspect of the methods described herein relates to the use of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in combination with a compound that reduces flushing. Conventional compounds such as aspirin ibuprofen naproxen indomethacin other NSAIDs COX 2 selective inhibitors and the like are useful in this regard at conventional doses. Alternatively DP antagonists are useful as well. Doses of the DP receptor antagonist and selectivity are such that the DP antagonist selectively modulates the DP receptor without substantially modulating the CRTH2 receptor. In particular the DP receptor antagonist ideally has an affinity at the DP receptor i.e. K that is at least about 10 times higher a numerically lower K value than the affinity at the CRTH2 receptor. Any compound that selectively interacts with DP according to these guidelines is deemed DP selective . This is in accordance with US Published Application No. 2004 0229844A1 published on Nov. 18 2004 incorporated herein by reference.

Dosages for DP antagonists as described herein that are useful for reducing or preventing the flushing effect in mammalian patients particularly humans include dosages ranging from as low as about 0.01 mg day to as high as about 100 mg day administered in single or divided daily doses. Preferably the dosages are from about 0.1 mg day to as high as about 1.0 g day in single or divided daily doses.

Examples of compounds that are particularly useful for selectively antagonizing DP receptors and suppressing the flushing effect include the following 

The compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof and the DP antagonist can be administered together or sequentially in single or multiple daily doses e.g. bid tid or qid without departing from the invention. If sustained release is desired such as a sustained release product showing a release profile that extends beyond 24 hours dosages may be administered every other day. However single daily doses are preferred. Likewise morning or evening dosages can be utilized.

Salts and solvates of the compounds of formula I are also included in the present invention and numerous pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates of nicotinic acid are useful in this regard. Alkali metal salts in particular sodium and potassium form salts that are useful as described herein. Likewise alkaline earth metals in particular calcium and magnesium form salts that are useful as described herein. Various salts of amines such as ammonium and substituted ammonium compounds also form salts that are useful as described herein. Similarly solvated forms of the compounds of formula I are useful within the present invention. Examples include the hemihydrate mono di tri and sesquihydrate.

The compounds of the invention also include esters that are pharmaceutically acceptable as well as those that are metabolically labile. Metabolically labile esters include Calkyl esters preferably the ethyl ester. Many prodrug strategies are known to those skilled in the art. One such strategy involves engineered amino acid anhydrides possessing pendant nucleophiles such as lysine which can cyclize upon themselves liberating the free acid. Similarly acetone ketal diesters which can break down to acetone an acid and the active acid can be used.

The compounds used in the present invention can be administered via any conventional route of administration. The preferred route of administration is oral.

The pharmaceutical compositions described herein are generally comprised of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Examples of suitable oral compositions include tablets capsules troches lozenges suspensions dispersible powders or granules emulsions syrups and elixirs. Examples of carrier ingredients include diluents binders disintegrants lubricants sweeteners flavors colorants preservatives and the like. Examples of diluents include for example calcium carbonate sodium carbonate lactose calcium phosphate and sodium phosphate. Examples of granulating and disintegrants include corn starch and alginic acid. Examples of binding agents include starch gelatin and acacia. Examples of lubricants include magnesium stearate calcium stearate stearic acid and talc. The tablets may be uncoated or coated by known techniques. Such coatings may delay disintegration and thus absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period.

One embodiment of the invention that is of interest is a tablet or capsule that is comprised of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in an amount ranging from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

In another embodiment of the invention a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof is combined with another therapeutic agent and the carrier to form a fixed combination product. This fixed combination product may be a tablet or capsule for oral use.

More particularly in another embodiment of the invention a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof about 0.1 to about 1000 mg and the second therapeutic agent about 0.1 to about 500 mg are combined with the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier providing a tablet or capsule for oral use.

Sustained release over a longer period of time may be particularly important in the formulation. A time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. The dosage form may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 256 108 4 166 452 and 4 265 874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release.

Other controlled release technologies are also available and are included herein. Typical ingredients that are useful to slow the release of nicotinic acid in sustained release tablets include various cellulosic compounds such as methylcellulose ethylcellulose propylcellulose hydroxypropylcellulose hydroxyethylcellulose hydroxypropylmethylcellulose microcrystalline cellulose starch and the like.

It is understood that similar reagents conditions or other synthetic approaches to these structure classes are conceivable to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Therefore these reaction schemes should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. All substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise.

Compounds of Formula I where X represents CH a represents 2 and b represents 1 such that the sum of a and b is 3 can be prepared as illustrated in Scheme 2 by coupling commercially available methyl or ethyl 2 amino cyclo hex 1 ene 1 carboxylate 5 or 6 with the appropriate acid in the presence of methanesulfonyl chloride and DMAP to give the desired amide 7. The ester can be saponified to the desired compound 8 by methods known to those skilled in the art.

Shown in Scheme 3 is the preparation of acid of the structure 10 from commercially available material 9 by methods known to one skilled in the art such as hydrogenation in a polar solvent such as methanol or ethanol using Pd C as a catalyst.

Compounds with the structure 19 can be prepared by the chemistry outlined in Scheme 4. Thus 6 methoxy 2 naphthaldehyde 11 can be treated with a suitable ylide such as tert Butoxycarbonyl methylene triphenyl phospharane in a non polar solvent such as toluene or xylenes under refluxing conditions to give the desired olefin 12. Hydrogenation of the double bond can be accomplished using standard conditions such as H g Pd C in a suitable polar solvent like methanol or ethanol to give 13. Removal of the methyl group in the methoxynaphthyl moiety can be accomplished with boron tribromide at low temperature followed by a careful quenching of the reaction with methanol to give the trans esterified product 14. Saponification of the ester was accomplished using conditions described earlier. The naphthol can be protected as the TBS ether using TBSOTf or TBS Cl in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine or imidazole in dichloromethane. The TBS ester can be hydrolyzed with a mild acid such as acetic acid in THF HO to give the desired acid 17. This acid can be coupled to the methyl or ethyl 2 aminocyclo hex 1 ene 1 carboxylate in the presence of methanesulfonyl chloride and DMAP to give the desired amide 18. Finally TBS ether removal and methyl ester saponification can be achieved using NaOH THF HO providing compounds of the structure 19.

Compounds with the structure 28 can be prepared by the chemistry outlined in Scheme 5. Thus treating a suitable tetralone such as 20 with LDA at low temperature followed by the addition of a suitable acylating agent such as 4 chloro 4 oxobutyrate provides the desired diketo ester 21. The ester can be saponified using standard conditions known to one skilled in the art to give the acid 22.
