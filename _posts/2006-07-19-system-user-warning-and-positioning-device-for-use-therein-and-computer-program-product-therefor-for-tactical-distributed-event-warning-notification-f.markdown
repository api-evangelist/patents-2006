This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 764 384 entitled System for Event Warning Notification and Reporting for Individual Entities and filed Jan. 26 2006 which is fully incorporated herein by reference herein.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used imported sold and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment or any royalty thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to the field of communications notification and warning systems and more particularly to a network information system that combines hardware components and a corresponding computer software system to provide a distributed system for real time event warning notification to numerous individual entities across dispersed locations via one or more central event threat receiving stations one or more network bridges and one or more user warning and positioning devices. Further a user warning and positioning device for operation within the above system is provided which allows the tracking and warning of users of the system.

One of the salient features of today s modern organizations on a global national regional and local level is the ability to leverage information technology to command and control systems in real or near real time. Advances in the technologies that integrate sensor and communications systems for instance facilitate determination of the precise location of mobile vehicles. Also a plurality of modern information systems permit such location determination including space airborne terrestrial and marine based command and control systems.

Every vehicle equipped with such a command and control system is able to determine the location using global positioning system GPS technology and then report that vehicle s information to higher command structures systems using secure wireless linkages. Vehicles equipped with command and control systems also receive a variety of messages from higher command structures systems including the known locations of other related vehicles and other unknown or suspected locations of non related vehicles. Command and control systems also allow vehicles to send and receive warning messages and in turn permit for instance the alerting of related vehicles about such significant events whether developing or in progress.

Though command and control systems warning messages are often manually generated there are other information systems in use today such as weather and tsunami stations that automatically generate threat warning messages without human intervention. One of the military systems that automatically generates a threat warning message is the AN TPQ 36 Firefinder Counter fire Radar which is able to detect projectiles in flight compute their predicted points of origin and predicted points of impact and automatically broadcast this information to other systems. The above described system still leaves the most numerous and vulnerable assets humans exposed to threats. Thus there is a need to significantly enhance survivability.

Accordingly there is a need for a network information system that allows command organizations structures to know the location in real time of all their remote human assets such as dismounted soldiers emergency responders remote construction crews etc. as well as warn those assets whenever an event such as a threat exists or is inbound. These warnings must be expeditiously distributed received and processed to permit sufficient time for potentially affected human assets to alter their protective posture and or take positive actions in response to the predicted event. In the past this quick response time has not been achieved in practice. This is understandable when considering the vast number of end systems and resulting costs required to equip every remote human asset in a field of operations.

Further there is a need for a system that enables training simulation and rehearsal capabilities along with real time use by organizations first responders public safety emergency management personnel etc. for providing warning of harmful events such as natural disasters medical emergencies military threats homeland security events and natural disaster incidents. In addition there is a need for remotely located individuals such as skiers hikers etc. to be provided with warning of harmful events such as sudden violent weather changes avalanches and natural disasters. Further there is a need for remotely located vehicles and vessels to be provided with a warning of potentially harmful events such as for example violent ocean conditions sea state changes and tidal waves.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a networked information system and user warning and positioning device for integration within said system that combines a plurality of components to effectively distribute a real time event warning notification to many individual entities across dispersed locations as well as a computer program product therefor. These individual entities in turn can then determine at the individual point whether or not these predicted events pertain to their locales and react accordingly.

It is another object of the present invention to enable the networked information system to monitor other connected information systems for externally and internally generated event warning notification messages.

It is yet another object of the present invention to transmit event warning notification messages on a secure wireless network to user warning and positioning devices in communication with the system whenever event warning notifications messages are received.

It is another object of the present invention to enable the user warning and positioning devices of the present system to retransmit received event warning notification messages to other user warning and positioning devices in the system that may not have received the original message.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a tailored event warning notification to a user of the networked information system user warning and positioning device and computer program product of the present invention based on message and user defined setup parameters.

Still a further object of the present invention is to track the location of each organization individual human asset and or vehicle equipped with a user warning and positioning device and periodically report this location information to designated command and control organizations structures whether space based airborne terrestrial and or marine based using standard or customized messaging formats.

Another object of the present invention is to enable the warning of each equipped organization individual human asset vehicle or other entity every time a significant event is predicted to occur or impact within a given distance from the individual user s location. In doing so it is desirable that the distance parameter be kept to a minimum to preclude false positives but also account for an expected event radius or area as well as for errors in determining the location of the user and of the predicted point of event or impact.

It is another object of the present invention to provide a secure network system by using encrypted communications. However the end system itself should not compromise friendly forces even when captured intact by an opponent. This means that the information contained in the user warning and positioning devices carried by individual assets or in vehicles should be minimal and of extremely limited utility to an adversary in the case of a military or confidential application.

Furthermore it is an object of the present invention to incorporate mechanisms that allow lost or captured user warning and positioning devices to be selectively excluded from participating in the network.

It is still another object of the present invention to permit assets users to carry an unobtrusive user warning and positioning device that is of minimal size. It is also an object of the present invention that the user warning and positioning device of the present system be capable of operating for extended periods of times on the order of weeks and months in a tactical environment with no required user interaction.

It is a further object of the present invention that the networked information system user warning and positioning device and computer program product of the present invention be applicable to training simulation and rehearsal along with real time use by organizations such as first responders public safety emergency management personnel and provide warning of harmful events such as emergency response homeland security natural disaster incidents. In addition it is an object of the present invention that the system user warning and positioning device and computer program product be applicable to remotely located individuals such as skiers hikers etc. to be provided warning of harmful events such as sudden violent weather changes avalanches natural disasters etc.

Further it is an object of the present invention that same be applicable to remotely located vehicles and vessels so as to provide warning of harmful events such as violent ocean conditions sea state changes tidal waves for example.

It is also an object of the present invention in order to overcome the difficulties discussed above to provide a software program product for use in such a system and user warning and positioning device to automatically facilitate the real time user warning notification to many individual entities equipped with the user warning and positioning devices across dispersed locations.

The following section describes various preferred embodiments of the present invention while exemplifying the distributed event warning notification system user warning and positioning device and computer program software of the present invention.

The present invention applies engineering design principles to improve commercial products and military applications for situational awareness and event warning. The present invention is a networked information system that combines hardware components wireless technologies and computer software programs to provide a system for real time event warning notification to many individual entities across dispersed locations. These entities in turn may determine whether or not these events pertain to their locales and react accordingly by activating an sensory alert mechanism therein.

For instance if the system is notified that an artillery shell is in the air and will strike a certain point at a certain time this message may be distributed to all nodes within the system i.e. all network bridges and user warning and positioning devices or alternatively to only those nodes to be affected by the threat allowing those assets within the danger radius to be alerted. The present invention supports a plurality of network types e.g. radio local area networks etc. and a plurality of system architectures e.g. centralized semi distributed distributed etc.

The present invention s system architecture satisfies the present invention s objectives by determining at the central local or user location as desired whether a user such as a public safety professional or soldier is inside a predicted future event area. This system achieves same by comparing the location of an individual user at the time of receipt of the future event warning at the central local or user warning and positioning device with each known event or threat area to determine whether or not said user must be warned at that time or at a later time up through the predicted future time of the event as the user changes geographic locations.

This is the most computationally intensive calculation required to satisfy the system and method objectives as errors in this calculation can either erode trust in the system or result in injury or death or both of the user. Accordingly the present invention s architecture permits the ongoing computation of user locations and threat areas at the end user warning and positioning devices from the time of receipt of the future event warning message at the user warning and positioning device up to the predicted future event time and the periodic transmission of messages from the user warning and positioning device to local and or central nodes containing data concerning the unique identifier and location of the user warning and positioning device and a timestamp of the message.

The present invention further provides a robust solution in the case of loss compromise or incapacitation of a computational node e.g. the user warning and positioning device by for example affecting only the individual user such as a public safety professional or soldier. Specifically according to the present invention network bridges are utilized to connect the user warning and positioning devices to command and control systems and sensor systems wherein the user warning and positioning devices are not affiliated with a specific network bridge. Instead each user warning and positioning device is able to exchange messages with any other system component whether that system component is another user warning and positioning device or a network bridge. The present invention is advantageous in that it increases the robustness of the ability to provide warnings within an event area or structure such as a building since each node is often multi homed.

Accordingly as shown in the present invention provides a distributed warning notification method and system of the present invention. In particular situational awareness workstation and threat warning gateways are provided in the form of fixed location gateways and or tactical mobile gateways to provide the principle data management in communication with one or more network bridges via LAN or radio networks. These network bridges in turn communicate with the user warning and positioning devices associated with the network.

Event warning information consists of data such as event type time of the event locale of the event etc. Subsequently an event warning message is communicated to the network bridges and in turn communicated to the user warning and positioning devices in communication therewith.

Location position information of the assets users is generated in the user warning and positioning devices via geographical positioning means GPS therein and position messages periodically sent from the user warning and positioning device concerning the unique identifier and location of the user warning and positioning device and a timestamp of the position message to the network bridges via the geographical positioning means GPS and wireless transmission means of the user warning and positioning device. The position messages received from the individual user warning and positioning devices are then communicated from the network bridges to the situational awareness workstation and threat warning gateways.

For example when an event warning message is received by a gateway location and time of the event is calculated and an event warning message is sent to the network bridges. The event warning message is then communicated to either all of the user warning and positioning devices or only those devices to be affected and then the message is relayed from the individual user warning and positioning devices individual nodes to other local and individual nodes. Thus event and asset location information may be communicated not only to those assets individual nodes within the affected or threat area but also to and between assets not in the affected or threat area. Accordingly threat and location information may be communicated to all associated user warning and positioning devices within the system if desired.

The present invention s system includes three types of nodes the gateways central nodes network bridge devices local nodes and user warning and positioning devices individual nodes e.g. pager sized modularized user warning and positioning devices as illustrated in . The network bridge devices communicate on at least two separate networks. Most commonly one of these networks is the network over which the pager size user warning and positioning devices communicate. The other network s allows the system to receive externally generated event warning notification messages.

The pager sized user warning and positioning devices communicate wirelessly with the network bridge devices that receive alerts from the situational awareness workstation and threat warning gateway other network bridge devices other user warning and positioning devices and or other information systems communicating over a wired or wireless network. As shown in the user warning and positioning device consists of five major components i.e. a power supply a GPS receiver a single board computer SBC a radio frequency transceiver module Radio and alarms both auditory and vibrating . The GPS SBC and Radio are interconnected using universal asynchronous receive transmit DART serial lines. The alarms are connected to the SBC using general purpose input output GPIO lines.

In one preferred embodiment of the user warning and positioning device the single board computer SBC is the Gumstix Basix 400f which is based on the Intel XScale PXA255 processor running at 400 MHz with 64 MB of SDRAM and 4 MB of Flash RAM. It also has a Linux 2.6 kernel and has a very small form factor. The SBC has multiple serial ports and a plurality of general purpose input output GPIO ports. Further the radio module is the 9XTend wireless module by MaxStream . It is a 900 MHz frequency hopping spread spectrum transceiver capable of transmitting at power levels between 1 milliwatt to one watt. The module also incorporates 256 bit Advanced Encryption Standard AES encryption and has a simple universal asynchronous receiver transmitter UART interface that is controlled with standard AT commands. The 9XTend supports up to 65 000 network addresses on 10 independent networks.

The GPS receiver of the above preferred embodiment is the FS Oncore by Mototola which is very small inexpensive and capable of operating with very weak signal levels of around 142 dBm. Furthermore the FS Oncore provides a host of advanced functionality including serial communications and the National Marine Electronics Association NMEA communications interface. This means that the SBC can communicate with the GPS receiver using text commands on a serial interface which simplifies the software design. The advanced power management function of the user warning and positioning device permits the conservation of power by putting the chip the single board computer in sleep mode when not in use. Although not depicted a custom printed circuit board was used wherein most of the circuits are related to power.

The single board computer is at the center of the user warning and positioning device and is where the user warning and positioning device application software program product is executed. This software initializes all system components upon power up and then repeats the following basic steps 

Whenever an event warning notification message is received its time is compared to the local time to determine if the event will occur in the future or has already happened. If the event will occur in the future the authenticity of the event warning message is verified by examining its digital signature. If the signature is valid the application software program will activate the alarm based on the time remaining until impact. It will also re transmit the message so that other devices that may not be in range of the originating device may also receive this message. All invalid or elapsed warning messages are logged and then discarded. The re transmission feature can be disabled to prolong power life or reduce the risk of enemy detection.

The user warning and positioning device running the application software program on the SBC also transmits periodic messages to the local nodes containing the unique identifier of the device location of the device and timestamp of the message. The frequency of these messages is indicated in the configuration file. Whenever the update interval transpires the user warning and positioning device transmits the above message so that other devices on the network can track the location of that particular user warning and positioning device. If desired however this functionality can be disabled in the device configuration.

The present invention permits message and source authentication encryption secure reconfiguration of devices and remote zero. Accordingly the system user warning and positioning device and application software program product utilize public key infrastructure PKI to mitigate security risks to the system itself. In particular when the individual warning device is initially configured it is loaded with a plurality e.g. four separate encryption keys 1 the device s own certificate 2 the device s own private key 3 the certificate of the bridge serving as the root certificate authority 4 the shared secret key for encrypting messages.

Further keys are issued by the network bridge device that is acting as the root certificate authority for all nodes in the network. Certificates are signed by this root CA to allow nodes to authenticate one another. Moreover certificate revocation is provided. Thus the invention permits both a device and its bridge to authenticate each other and is particularly important whenever the device s configuration is remotely modified. As a practical field operation protocol the only key that should be changed over the air is the shared secret key but only after the identity of the bridge has been verified.

Moreover transmission encryption is provided. In the preferred embodiment of the user warning and positioning device described above the 9Xtend wireless radio module has built in support for transmission encryption using the advanced encryption standard AES with a 256 bit secret key. The AES algorithm meets Federal Information Processing Standard 197 FIPS 197 . Accordingly the encryption key cannot be read out of the module by any means. The entire payload of the packet is encrypted using the key and the cyclic redundancy check CRC is computed across the ciphertext. A module with the wrong key or no key will still receive encrypted data but this data will be useless in its meaning. Likewise a module with a key will still receive unencrypted data sent from a module without a key but the output will be similarly meaningless.

According to the present invention certain types of messages such as messages instructing a user warning and positioning device to modify its configuration are authenticated upon receipt. Specifically in such a case the user warning and positioning devices will verify the identity of a message sender via an authentication process. The authentication process is performed according to the following steps 

Step 1 A network bridge sends a configuration message to a specific user warning and positioning device. This message contains a plurality of values e.g. three separated or parsed 1 the parameter name e.g. retransmit 2 the desired value e.g. no and 3 the secure hash of the concatenated parameter name equality sign and value e.g. retransmit no. This secure hash is a hash e.g. MD5 of the string encrypted using the bridge s private key.

Step 2 The recipient user warning and positioning device automatically looks in its cache for the sender s public key. If it doesn t find one the user warning and positioning device automatically sends a request for this public key to the sender. The sender then subsequently sends a message back to the user warning and positioning device with its public key which has been encrypted using the root CA s private key. The recipient user warning and positioning device that has the root CA s public key decrypts the public key it received from the sender and adds it to its cache.

Step 3 The recipient user warning and positioning device automatically computes the hash e.g. MD5 of the received string e.g. retransmit no. It then automatically decrypts the received hash using the sender s public key and compares the received and the computed hash values. If they match the recipient user warning and positioning device knows that this is a legitimate authentic message.

According to the present invention although a fixed infrastructure may be utilized there is no need for a fixed infrastructure. Thus as shown in the gateways may be fixed and or tactical mobile and the many user warning and positioning devices are able to communicate with each other as well as with any network bridges within range. Thus the wireless communications subsystem supports a large number of individual nodes user warning and positioning devices and local nodes network bridges operating simultaneously within a broadcast environment.

Furthermore since the system of the present invention can be deployed to hundreds of assets e.g. soldiers in a theater of operation emergency response personnel etc. the wireless communications subsystem must also provide a mechanism for breaking up broadcast domains. The present invention permits different domains to be assigned to the various user warning and positioning devices so that said devices may operate in close proximity to each other without interfering with each other s receiving and transmitting functions.

The user warning and positioning device of the present invention also provides for adaptive power management. The user warning and positioning device transmits at the lowest possible power level in order to conserve energy as well as to minimize the risk of enemy detection in military or law enforcement applications. Alternately the user warning and positioning devices is capable of transmitting at a fairly high power level when operating in challenging environments such as densely developed urban areas or mountainous environments or when the user e.g. a soldier is laying prone or the user s vehicle has a low profile. Thus the present invention s communications module s output power is configurable in a flexible manner by the user warning and positioning device s computer processing means.

In one embodiment of the present invention the user warning and positioning device s configuration file encryption key and or software is updated using a physical or secure wireless connection from a trusted source. This trust like the validity of received event warning messages is based on a digital signature. The present invention s physical connections for updates permit the system to be securely reconfigured when a key or device has been compromised.

Also the present invention considers the potential exploitation of these devices by adversaries in the military or law enforcement applications. Given the fact that the user warning and positioning devices are configured to generate location reports periodically it may be possible to triangulate the position of each asset. To address this threat the present invention s communications module provides the capability to thwart basic triangulation efforts by for example utilizing spread spectrum technologies. Spread spectrum techniques are methods in which energy generated at a single frequency is deliberately spread over a wide band of frequencies. This is done for a variety of reasons including increasing resistance to natural interference or jamming and to prevent hostile detection. A contemporary application of this technique is used in the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System SINCGARS by changing frequencies frequency hopping several times per second. The current embodiment of this invention similarly uses frequency hopping spread spectrum techniques.

In general the objectives and functions of the network event warning system are carried out as follows 

In step 1 an action event occurs that generates a predictable event s that will occur in the future. Example An enemy artillery battery shoots at a friendly unit location. 

In step 2 the action event is detected by an action detection means characterized via direct or indirect means to formulate action characterization information and the action characterization information subsequently fed to one or more of the fixed and or tactical mobile gateways. Potential action detection mechanisms include optical electromagnetic radio frequency and or acoustic methods that discretely or in combination characterize the initial and or ongoing action. Example A friendly artillery locating radar picks up the incoming enemy artillery round and accurately measures its ballistic based path of flight .

In Step 3 the action characterization information is processed and analyzed by the gateways in a timely manner. The result of this analysis generates predicted corresponding future event and associated relevant information and is constituted into an event warning message. The event warning message includes for example event type e.g. enemy attack approaching severe weather etc. predicted location area impacted by the event predicted start time of the event and predicted duration of the event. For example the gateways separate from or integrated with a command and control system associated with friendly artillery locating radar uses the ballistic based path of flight and speed of the enemy artillery round information received from the friendly artillery locating radar to determine the predicted Time of Impact PTI and predicted point of impact PPI of the enemy artillery round with corresponding affected area footprint considering any ballistic measurement errors .

In step 4 the event warning message is universally distributed to the local nodes i.e. the network bridges within the information network with or without regard to whether a specific user warning and positioning device located within the area of a local node will be affected by the future event. In the distributed method of warning event warning messages are communicated to all user warning and positioning devices regardless of the relative position to the predicted area of the event. While there is increased load on the communications network e.g. increased use of bandwidth in such a distributed method such a distributed method provides rapid and accurate event warning notification to individual entities since there are no time delays or asset location errors associated with unit position reporting latencies and centralized computational processes to determine which user warning and positioning devices will be specifically impacted by an event. Thus the distributed method of warning permits very short warning notification time windows between event detection and impact on individual entities.

In contrast to the distributed method a centralized network configuration wherein the event warning message is sent only to the network bridge and user warning and positioning devices in the affected area may be utilized wherein computational processes are performed in centralized locations such as the gateways to determine which user warning and positioning devices will be specifically impacted by an event and the event warning message distributed only to the predetermined affected users. This method is more efficient in terms of the communications load i.e. the amount of bandwidth used to broadcast a warning. However such a system requires longer warning notification time windows between event detection and impact on individual entities.

In step 5 which is optional if either the communications network information network and or versions of components within this system are heterogeneous in nature then a translation of the event warning notification message may be required in terms of format and content to insure compatibility and continuity of timely transmittal as the event warning notification message makes it way to the electronically addressed assets e.g. humans carrying user warning and positioning devices. For example the command and control system generates a variable message format VMF based strike warning message s . The unit borne system addressed for receipt of this strike warning message is only able to parse and understand extensible Markup Language XML based messages. An interim system device process is required to translate the strike warning message from VMF to XML. 

In step 6 the asset borne component of the system i.e. the user warning and positioning devices receive and locally parse process the future event warning notification message in a timely manner via the warning and positioning device computer processing means running the computer program product of the present invention. Whenever an event warning message is received by the user warning and positioning device the predicted time of the event is compared to the local time to determine whether or not the event will occur at some future time. If the event will occur in the future the event warning message s authenticity is automatically verified by examining its digital signature. If the signature is valid the locale that is affected by the future event is automatically compared to the locale of the individual node e.g. the location of the user warning and positioning device . If the node is within the affected area it will notify the user via the sensory notification means e.g. an audible alarm or voice message and or a vibrator based on the time remaining until the future event

The user warning and positioning device will also re transmit the received event warning message so that other individual and local nodes that may not be in range of the original transmission by the network bridge may also receive the event warning message. This greatly extends the geographical scope of the network system.

All invalid or elapsed warning messages are logged and then discarded by the user warning and positioning devices. The re transmission feature on the user warning and positioning devices can be disabled to prolong power life or reduce the risk of detection in military and law enforcement applications. Example A pager sized unit borne user warning and positioning device carried by an individual dismounted soldier receives and validates an XML base strike warning message. Computational logic within this device activates several notification mechanisms found within the device .

In step 7 based on the set of actions selected by the user warning and positioning device the user is warned notified via sensory mean s singular or in combination prior to and during the time period of the event occurrence. These sensory indicia include auditory visual and or physical stimulation of an individual s bodily senses. Example The pager sized warning and positioning device both vibrates and sounds an audible alarm notifying the affected soldier to change his protective posture prior to impact of the enemy artillery round .

The present invention s network bridge s provide two principle functions. First they provide an interface between the end devices e.g. user warning and positioning devices and the external systems that generate and utilize warning notification information such as the gateways. In this role the network bridges translate messages received from other systems into event warning messages. In addition the network bridges translate the messages received from the individual user warning and positioning devices into other message formats utilized by other different and multiple command and control systems. Thus the network bridge also filters messages that should not be sent from one network to the other e.g. spot reports coming from a terrestrial command and control system.

Second the network bridge acts as a management device for the individual user warning and positioning devices. The network bridge keeps track of the status of the user warning and positioning devices with which it has communications contact and permits the selective disablement or remote alteration of any individual user warning and positioning device that appears to have been compromised or lost. The network bridge permits the configuration and or reconfiguration of any parameter in the individual user warning and positioning devices e.g. changing the URN of a replacement device issued to a soldier.

The present invention s network bridges communicate with sensor warning and command and control systems CCS s that use different networks and protocols. For example the present invention s network bridge can use the internet protocol IP at the network layer. Moreover the network bridge can communicate using both a local area network LAN and a point to point PPP link in order to support both mobile tactical and fixed installations.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the network bridge device is implemented using a laptop computer running on a conventional operating system. The network bridge supports various formats such as extensible Markup Language XML messages over an Ethernet interface Joint Variable Format Message JVMF over a point to point protocol PPP interface etc. When a CCS is connected to a tactical network e.g. SINCGARS the CCS connects over its serial port to the Inter Network Controller INC which is a tactical router mounted on the radio s vehicular adapter. The serial connection is established using PPP. Then the CCS queries the INC to determine its configuration and if necessary reconfigures it using the simple network management protocol SNMP . Thereafter the CCS exchanges regular IP traffic e.g. event warning messages across the serial port. When the CCS is running on a LAN multicast groups are utilized to transmit packets. By contrast other sensor and warning systems use other languages such as extensible markup language XML for the messages.

The present invention is applicable to numerous CCS s such as space airborne terrestrial and marine based system. For instance multiple terrestrial bases systems can be utilized. For example some CCS s utilize non persistent transmission control protocol TCP connections to send messages. Thus such CCS s create a client socket that connects to a server socket on the receiving system i.e. the present system s network bridge sends the XML message and then disconnects. On the other hand other CCS s create a client socket that connects to the server socket on the receiving system i.e. the network bridge of the present invention and then maintains that connection indefinitely. When a message needs to be transmitted there is no delay in setting up a connection and if the connection is lost the CCS will immediately detect the lost connection and try to re establish it.

The present invention permits message and source authentication encryption secure reconfiguration of user warning and positioning devices and remote zero. Accordingly the system user warning and positioning device and computer program product of the present invention utilize public key infrastructure PKI to mitigate security risks to the system itself. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention when an individual user warning and positioning device is initially configured it is loaded with a plurality e.g. four separate encryption keys as follows 

Further keys are issued by the network bridges that are acting as the root certificate authority for all nodes in the network bridge area of operation. Certificates are signed by this root certificate authority CA to allow nodes such as user warning and positioning devices and network bridges to authenticate one another. Moreover certificate revocation is provided. Thus the present invention permits both a user warning and positioning device and its associated network bridge to authenticate each other and is particularly important whenever the user warning and positioning device s configuration is remotely modified. As a practical field operation protocol the only key that should be changed over the air is the shared secret key but only after the identity of the network bridge has been verified.

Moreover transmission encryption is provided. Accordingly the encryption key cannot be read out of the module by any means. The entire payload of the data packet is encrypted using the key and the cyclic redundancy check CRC is computed across the ciphertext. A module with the wrong key or no key will still receive encrypted data but this data will be unreadable and useless. Likewise a module with a key will still receive unencrypted data sent from a module without a key but the output will be similarly meaningless.

According to the present invention certain types of event warning messages are authenticated upon receipt. Specifically in these cases the user warning and positioning devices will verify the identity of a message sender when the received message instructs the user warning and positioning device to modify its configuration. Thus authentication is performed according to the following steps 

Step 1 A network bridge sends a configuration message to a specific user warning and positioning device. This message contains a plurality of values e.g. three separated or parsed values as follows 

3 the secure hash of the concatenated parameter name equality sign and value e.g. retransmit no. This secure hash is a hash e.g. MD5 of the string encrypted using the bridge s private key.

Step 2 The recipient user warning and positioning device automatically looks in its cache for the sender s the network bridge mentioned in Step 1 public key. If it doesn t find one the user warning and positioning device automatically sends a request for this key to the sender. The sender subsequently sends a message with its public key which has been encrypted using the root certificate authority s private key. The recipient that has the root CA s public key decrypts the key it received and adds it to its cache.

Step 3 The recipient user warning and positioning device automatically computes the hash e.g. MD5 of the received string e.g. retransmit no. The user warning and positioning device then automatically decrypts the received hash using the sender s public key and compares the received and the computed hash values. If they match the recipient user warning and positioning device knows that the received configuration message is a legitimate authentic message.

According to the present invention the event warning message may reach as many user warning and positioning devices as possible as the event warning messages may be transmitted to all network bridges and all individual nodes even if these network bridges and nodes do not appear to be inside the affected area. In the event that a number of user warning and positioning devices are not in communication contact with a network bridge at a particular point in time the system of the present invention allows the user warning and positioning devices to selectively relay future event warning messages including multiple occurrences.

The present invention permits retransmission of event warning messages in appropriate instances depending on the specified configuration of the user warning and positioning devices e.g. when the event warning message contains an appropriate configuration file. Thus a specific event warning message can be transmitted once or multiple times. In the case that the event warning message is to be communicated only once e.g. to prevent redundancy of an event warning message that has already occurred the system will ensure that it is configured not to allow retransmissions. The system checks e.g. a local cache to ensure the message has not already been relayed. Conversely in the case of retransmission the system checks to ensure that the threatened event has not occurred in the past.

The present invention is also particularly robust through its integration of verbal as opposed to plain sound warnings. In particular specific event warning messages are transmitted to the user warning and positioning device decoded therein to determine the future event and appropriate spoken warning to be broadcast and a corresponding audible spoken warning made to the user so that users hear a human voice broadcast by the user warning and positioning device instructing the user as to what subsequent actions to undertake.

The system user warning and positioning device and computer program product of the present invention are also useful for training simulation and rehearsal along with real time use by organizations such as first responders public safety emergency management personnel with warning of harmful events such as emergency response homeland security natural disaster incidents etc. For example the present invention supports first responders in disaster areas by tracking their location and allowing a command post to send a danger signal i.e. and event warning message if an unsafe condition is detected in a particular sector. The danger signal would only affect the personnel in the danger area such as perhaps a building about to collapse.

In another example the present invention supports law enforcement officers by allowing a precinct to position the officers to best deter or respond to criminal activity. Further the present invention provides remotely located individuals such as skiers hikers etc. with warning of harmful events such as sudden violent weather changes avalanches natural disasters etc. Further the present invention provides remotely located vehicles such as watercraft with advanced warning of impending harmful events in their locale such as violent ocean conditions water spouts sea state changes tidal waves etc.

The present invention is applicable to commercial non military as well as military applications. Further the possible events addressed by the system method and computer program product of present invention range from day to day events such as a street side performance at a large amusement park road closing due to construction etc. to life threatening events such as the imminent collapse of a building within a disaster area the imminent detonation of a roadside bomb etc. The human computer interface implemented at the user warning and positioning device carried by the individual entities determines the content and amount of information that is relayed to the invention s users and can be flexibly configured to address a multitude of events and threats.
