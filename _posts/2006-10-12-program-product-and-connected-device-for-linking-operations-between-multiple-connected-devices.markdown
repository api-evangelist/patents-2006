The present invention relates to a program product for linking operations between multiple devices connected to each other via a network and to a connected device that serves to link operations between the multiple connected devices.

There are proposed methods for linking operations between multiple devices connected to each other via a network. For example Japanese laid open patent publication 2002 186067 discloses an electric appliance control device that is designed to control all electric appliances connected thereto such as a television receiver an air conditioner and a telephone by receiving a control command from one of the electric appliances via a communication line storing the received control command in a code memory provided in a control signal sending receiving unit and sending the control command received from the electric appliance which is stored in the code memory from an infrared transmitter receiver in the control signal sending receiving unit. This device enables linked operations such as turning down the volume on the television receiver in response to a telephone call.

However the above described electric appliance control device has the following problem. When an event e.g. an incoming call occurs at an external device e.g. the telephone the control device always performs a process for a device e.g. the television receiver that is to operate in conjunction with the external device such a device is hereinafter referred to as linked device without respect to the state of the linked device. For example even when there is no audio signal input to the television receiver at the time of the incoming call the control device may perform the process for turning down the volume on the television receiver. As another example assume that the control device has been programmed to cause a hard disk drive HDD recorder to automatically start recording when a call at the telephone lasts more than a given time. In this case when the given time has elapsed from the start of a call at the telephone the control device may perform the process for causing the HDD recorder to automatically start recording even when the HDD recorder is already during recording. Accordingly the electric appliance control device disclosed in Japanese laid open patent publication 2002 186067 cannot always allow linked operations to be performed as a user truly desires. Further the electric appliance control device disclosed in Japanese laid open patent publication 2002 186067 has a problem that it requires the above described control signal sending receiving unit as well as a dedicated device such as a personal computer as the electric appliance control device.

Japanese laid open patent publication 2004 304789 discloses an electric appliance control device and an electric appliance control method for when receiving from a user the designation of an appliance in a state different from a state desired by the user identifying a linked operation to be modified based on a linked operation table appliance history information and so on and then modifying the linked operation table so that the appliance can be in the desired state at a reference time.

Further Japanese laid open patent publication 2004 258809 discloses a middleware for information appliance networks that upon receipt of a service request from a user activates a service component corresponding to the requested service in accordance with service component information contained in a look up table.

However the inventions disclosed in Japanese laid open patent publication Nos. 2004 304789 and 2004 258809 always perform an operation for a linked device without respect to the state of the linked device when an event occurs at an external device. Accordingly neither of the inventions allows linked operations to be always performed as a user truly desires.

An object of the present invention is to provide a program and a connected device that upon the occurrence of an event at an external device can perform an operation for a linked device after taking into account the state of the linked device so that linked operations can be performed as a user truly desires.

According to a first aspect of the present invention this object is achieved by a program product stored on a recordable medium for linking operations between multiple connected devices connected to each other via a network.

The program product is installed in a connected device hereinafter referred to as linked device of the multiple connected devices.

The program product comprises program code for setting a state of the linked device for execution of linked operations between the connected devices a state change hereinafter referred to as occurrence of an event at an external device in the network that is a condition for execution of the linked operations and an operation of the linked device to be executed upon the occurrence of the event at the external device program code for storing settings set by the program code for setting program code for sending to the external device a request for registration of necessity to notify the linked device of occurrence of an event when the event occurs at the external device program code for upon receipt of a notification of occurrence of an event from the external device determining whether an operation of the linked device that corresponds to a current state of the linked device and to the notified event is stored or not and program code for when it is found as a result of the determination that the corresponding operation of the linked device is stored executing the stored operation.

With the above configuration when a notification of occurrence of an event is received from an external device an operation of the linked device can be executed so as to be appropriate to the current state of the linked device as well as to the notified event. In this manner upon the occurrence of an event at an external device an operation of the linked device can be executed after the current state of the linked device is taken into account. This can increase the probability that linked operations will be performed as a user truly desires.

Preferably the program code for setting is program code for further setting the external device at which the event occurs.

Preferably the multiple connected devices are in conformity with Universal Plug and Play UPnP standard.

According to a second aspect of the present invention the object is achieved by a connected device of multiple connected devices connected to each other via a network.

The connected device comprises linked operation setting means for setting a state of the connected device itself for execution of linked operations between the connected devices a state change hereinafter referred to as occurrence of an event at an external device in the network that is a condition for execution of the linked operations and an operation of the connected device itself to be executed upon the occurrence of the event at the external device linked operation setting storage means for storing settings set by the linked operation setting means registration request sending means for sending to the external device a request for registration of necessity to notify the connected device itself of occurrence of an event when the event occurs at the external device determining means for upon receipt of a notification of occurrence of an event from the external device determining whether or not an operation of the connected device itself that corresponds to a current state of the connected device itself and to the notified event is stored in the linked operation setting storage means and executing means for when it is found as a result of the determination by the determining means that the corresponding operation of the connected device itself is stored executing the stored operation.

While the novel features of the present invention are set forth in the appended claims the present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings.

Referring now to the accompanying drawings a preferred embodiment of the present invention is described. The present invention relates to a linked operation program for linking operations between multiple devices connected to each other via a network and to a connected device that serves to link operations between the multiple connected devices. In the embodiment described below a linked operation program according to the present invention is installed in a digital television receiver hereinafter referred to simply as DTV . It is to be noted that the following description of preferred embodiment of the present invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present invention to the precise form disclosed.

The tuner is a tuner for digital television broadcasts Advanced Television System Committee ATSC broadcasts which extracts a broadcast signal on a user selected channel from ATSC broadcast signals received by an antenna . The ATSC front end demodulates broadcast signals extracted by the tuner into transport stream TS packets in which video and audio signals for multiple television programs an electronic program guide signal and so on are time division multiplexed. The ATSC front end then extracts video and audio signals for a television program on a user selected channel from the TS packets for output to the MPEG decoder as well as extracting the electronic program guide signal for output to the microprocessor . The MPEG decoder decodes MPEG compressed digitally compressed in accordance with the MPEG standard video and audio signals received from the ATSC front end into original video and audio signals before the MPEG compression. The OSD circuit is a circuit for superimposing a signal corresponding to on screen display data such as a channel number an EPG screen or the like on a video signal output from the MPEG decoder . The monitor displays an image based on a video signal with or without an on screen display data signal superimposed thereon that is output from the OSD circuit . The loudspeaker outputs an audio based on an audio signal output from the MPEG decoder .

The memory stores initial setting data an initial setting program that is a program for input of the initial setting data and a linked operation control program that is a program for control of an operation linked with an external device based on the initial setting data . The initial setting program and the linked operation control program correspond to claimed linked operation program. The initial setting program and the microprocessor correspond to claimed linked operation setting means. The initial setting program the microprocessor and the I F correspond to claimed registration request sending means. Further the linked operation control program and the microprocessor correspond to claimed determining means and executing means.

The I F is an interface circuit for sending and receiving data to and from the other connected devices connected devices other than the DTV over the home IP network . The infrared receiver receives an infrared command signal transmitted from a remote control and converts the command signal into a standard digital signal for output to the microprocessor .

The remote control has an infrared transmitter and a key portion where arranged are various keys such as a power key numeric keys cursor keys an enter key and a menu key for causing various menus to be displayed. These keys on the remote control are used for example to make settings on various menu screens.

Referring now to it is described a process for setting an operation linked with an external device process described in the initial setting program . The process starts when a user selects the setting of an operation linked with an external device with the use of the remote control S . In response to the selection the microprocessor of the DTV displays a state list screen which is one of linked operation setting menus on the monitor as shown in . In this state the user can select set a state of the DTV itself for execution of the linked operation by selecting a state button displayed on the state list screen with the use of the remote control S . Then the microprocessor of the DTV displays an external device list screen on the monitor as shown in so as to prompt the user to select a linked external device. The external device list screen shows in the default state device buttons indicating the types and manufacturer names of the other connected devices connected devices other than the DTV on the home IP network but it can alternatively show user desired device names within the device buttons .

When the user selects sets a linked external device by selecting a desired button of the device buttons displayed on the above described external device list screen with the use of the remote control S the microprocessor of the DTV displays an event list screen external device event list screen for the linked external device which can be monitored by the external device on the monitor as shown in and . Thereby the microprocessor prompts the user to select an event as a condition necessary for execution of the linked operations. shows an external device event list screen for the case where the linked external device is the telephone . shows an external device event list screen for the case where the linked external device is the intercom . For example in the case where the linked external device is the telephone an event occurs when the telephone changes to a state such as STANDBY STATE not during a call INCOMING CALL IS RECEIVED CALL IS STARTED or CALL IS ENDED as shown in i.e. when the state of the external device changes .

Subsequently the user can select set an event as a condition for execution of the linked operations by selecting a desired button of the event buttons displayed on the external device event list screen with the use of the remote control S . Then the microprocessor of the DTV displays an executed operation list screen on the monitor as shown in so as to prompt the user to select an operation of the DTV itself to be executed upon the occurrence of the event selected at the step S.

When the user selects an operation of the DTV itself to be executed when the event occurs at the external device by selecting a desired button of operation buttons displayed on the executed operation list screen with the use of the remote control S the microprocessor of the DTV stores registers the settings selected at the steps S to S as the initial setting data in the memory S . It is to be noted that although an operation of the DTV itself is set as the operation to be executed upon the occurrence of an event at an external device in the above described example an operation of a device other than the DTV can be also set as the operation to be executed upon the occurrence of an event at an external device. After completing the process of storing the initial setting data at the step S the microprocessor of the DTV sends to the linked external device selected at the step S a request for registration of necessity to notify the DTV itself of the occurrence of the event when the event occurs at the external device i.e. when the state of the external device changes in the form of SUBSCRIBE in accordance with the UPnP standard S . The process of setting an operation linked with an external device that is shown as the steps S to S is repeated until all operations linked with external devices are completely set YES at S .

Referring now to it is described what process is executed by the DTV itself when a notification of occurrence of an event is received from a linked external device selected at the selection step S this process is described in the linked operation control program . When the microprocessor of the DTV receives a notification of occurrence of an event from a linked external device YES at S it determines whether or not an operation of the DTV itself that corresponds to the current state of the DTV itself the external device from which the notification has been sent and the notified event is stored registered as the initial setting data in the memory S . If it is found as a result of the determination that an operation of the DTV corresponding to the conditions is stored registered in the memory YES at S the microprocessor of the DTV executes the operation stored registered in the memory S . The microprocessor of the DTV repeats the process of the steps S to S until the DTV itself is turned off YES at S .

Now advantages achieved by executing the process shown in to are described by giving an example. In this example assume that a user receives a call while viewing a television broadcast on the DTV . When receiving a call while viewing a television broadcast on the DTV a user should have a problem described below and should perform actions described below.

First the user should have the following problem. When the volume of sound output from the loudspeaker of the DTV is high the user cannot hear the telephone ringing this is hereinafter referred to as first problem . Actions to be performed by the user are as follows. First when the volume of sound output from the loudspeaker of the DTV is high it is hard for the user to hear the caller. Therefore the user should turn down the DTV before taking the incoming call hereinafter referred to as first action . Second if the call at the telephone lasts long and a current television program being broadcast is a desired one the user may desire to record the program hereinafter referred to as second action . Third when the call at the telephone ends the user should turn up the DTV again hereinafter referred to as third action .

The above described first problem can be solved by the microprocessor of the DTV turning down the volume to a predetermined level when the telephone rings. To enable this linked operation the user needs to make the following selections in the linked operation setting process shown in . First the user selects a state button indicating the state that requires turning down the volume on the DTV when the telephone rings from among the state buttons displayed on the DTV state list screen shown in . More particularly the user selects for example state buttons marked DURING VIEWING OF TELEVISION BROADCAST DURING PLAYBACK OF PROGRAM RECORDED ON EXTERNAL DEVICE and DURING RECORDING ON EXTERNAL DEVICE . Next the user selects a button corresponding to the telephone from among the device buttons displayed on the external device list screen shown in . Further the user selects an event button marked INCOMING CALL IS RECEIVED from among the event buttons displayed on the external device event list screen shown in and selects an operation button marked TURN DOWN VOLUME from among the operation buttons displayed on the executed operation list screen shown in .

The above described first action can be automatically performed by the microprocessor of the DTV executing a linked operation to further turn down the volume when the user answers the telephone . For enabling this linked operation the user needs to make the following selections in the linked operation setting process shown in . First the user selects a state button indicating the state that requires further turning down the volume on the DTV when a user answers the telephone from among the state buttons displayed on the DTV state list screen shown in . More particularly the user selects for example state buttons marked DURING VIEWING OF TELEVISION BROADCAST DURING PLAYBACK OF PROGRAM RECORDED ON EXTERNAL DEVICE and DURING RECORDING ON EXTERNAL DEVICE . Next the user selects the button corresponding to the telephone from among the device buttons displayed on the external device list screen shown in . Further the user selects an event button marked CALL IS STARTED from among the event buttons displayed on the external device event list screen shown in and selects an operation button marked MUTE from among the operation buttons displayed on the executed operation list screen shown in .

The above described second action can be automatically performed by the microprocessor of the DTV executing a linked operation to start recording on the HDD recorder when a call lasts more than a given time. For enabling this linked operation the user needs to make the following selections in the linked operation setting process shown in . First the user selects a state button indicating the state that requires the start of recording when the given time has elapsed from the start of a call from among the state buttons displayed on the DTV state list screen shown in . More particularly the user selects the state button marked DURING VIEWING OF TELEVISION BROADCAST . Next the user selects the button corresponding to the telephone from among the device buttons displayed on the external device list screen shown in . Further the user selects an event button marked CALL LASTS MORE THAN GIVEN TIME from among the event buttons displayed on the external device event list screen shown in and selects an operation button marked START RECORDING from among the operation buttons displayed on the executed operation list screen shown in .

In the case where the above described second action has been automatically performed and thus recording on the HDD recorder has been already started at the end of the call at the telephone the microprocessor of the DTV needs to prompt the user to start chasing playback. For this linked operation the user needs to make the following selections in the linked operation setting process shown in . First the user selects a state button indicating the state that requires chasing playback from among the state buttons displayed on the DTV state list screen shown in . More particularly the user selects the state button marked DURING RECORDING ON EXTERNAL DEVICE . Next the user selects the button corresponding to the telephone from among the device buttons displayed on the external device list screen shown in . Further the user selects an event button marked CALL IS ENDED from among the event buttons displayed on the external device event list screen shown in and selects an operation button marked DISPLAY CHASING PLAYBACK SELECTION SCREEN from among the operation buttons displayed on the executed operation list screen shown in . In accordance with the user selections described above the microprocessor of the DTV displays a chasing playback selection screen as shown in on the monitor to prompt the user to start chasing playback when a call at the telephone ends.

The above described third action can be automatically performed by executing a linked operation to turn up the DTV again after the end of a call at the telephone . To enable this linked operation the user needs to make the following selections in the linked operation setting process shown in . First the user selects a state button indicating the state that requires restoring of the volume of the DTV when a call at the telephone ends from among the state buttons displayed on the DTV state list screen shown in . More particularly the user selects for example the state buttons marked DURING VIEWING OF TELEVISION BROADCAST DURING PLAYBACK OF PROGRAM RECORDED ON EXTERNAL DEVICE and DURING RECORDING ON EXTERNAL DEVICE . Next the user selects the button corresponding to the telephone from among the device buttons displayed on the external device list screen shown in . Further the user selects the event button marked CALL IS ENDED from among the event buttons displayed on the external device event list screen shown in and selects an operation button marked RESTORE VOLUME from among the operation buttons displayed on the executed operation list screen shown in .

Another example is given for describing advantages achieved by executing the process shown in to . In this example assume that when a user is viewing on the DTV a program recorded on the HDD recorder a visitor rings the buzzer on the intercom see . When a visitor rings the buzzer on the intercom while a user is viewing on the DTV a program recorded on the HDD recorder the user should have a problem described below and should perform actions described below.

First the user should have the following problem. When the volume of sound output from the loudspeaker of the DTV is high the user cannot notice the visitor i.e. cannot hear the buzzer on the intercom this problem is hereinafter referred to as second problem . Actions to be performed by the user are as follows. First when the visitor comes i.e. when the buzzer on the intercom rings the user should pause the playback of the program being viewed this action is hereinafter referred to as fourth action . Second after the visitor leaves the user should resume the playback of the program being viewed this action is hereinafter referred to as fifth action .

The above described second problem can be solved by the microprocessor of the DTV displaying information indicating the visitor on the monitor when the buzzer on the intercom rings. To enable this linked operation the user needs to make the following selections in the linked operation setting process shown in . First the user selects the state button marked DURING PLAYBACK OF PROGRAM RECORDED ON EXTERNAL DEVICE from among the state buttons displayed on the DTV state list screen shown in . Next the user selects a button corresponding to the intercom from among the device buttons displayed on the external device list screen shown in . Further the user selects an event button marked BUZZER RINGS from among event buttons displayed on the external device event list screen shown in and selects an operation button marked DISPLAY VISITOR INFORMATION SCREEN from among the operation buttons displayed on the executed operation list screen shown in .

In accordance with the above described selections by the user the microprocessor of the DTV displays a visitor information screen shown in on the monitor to inform the user of the visitor when the buzzer on the intercom rings.

The above described fourth action can be performed by the microprocessor of the DTV in the following manner. When the user selects a confirm button on the visitor information screen displayed on the monitor with the use of the remote control the microprocessor of the DTV pauses the program being played. Further when the user selects the confirm button on the visitor information screen by the remote control the microprocessor of the DTV displays a visitor information screen shown in on the monitor as well as pausing the program being played.

The above described fifth action can be performed by the microprocessor of the DTV in the following manner. When the user selects a resume button on the visitor information screen displayed on the monitor with the use of the remote control the microprocessor of the DTV resumes the playback of the program.

As described above when receiving a notification of occurrence of an event from a linked external device the DTV in this embodiment can execute its operation appropriate to the current state of the DTV itself the external device from which the notification has been sent and the notified event. In this manner upon the occurrence of an event at an external device the DTV can execute its operation after taking into account the current state of the DTV itself. Accordingly the DTV can increase the probability that linked operations will be performed as a user truly desires.

The present invention has been described above using a presently preferred embodiment but those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications are possible. For example although the linked operation program according to the present invention is installed in the DTV in the above described embodiment it can be installed in other connected device such as a personal computer or a HDD recorder. It is desirable that a connected device in which a linked operation program according to the present invention is installed has a monitor capable of displaying various selection screens as shown in to . Further a connected device in which a linked operation program according to the present invention is installed as well as devices linked to the connected device does not necessarily need to be in conformity with the UPnP standard.

This application is based on Japanese patent application 2005 298729 filed Oct. 13 2005 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.
