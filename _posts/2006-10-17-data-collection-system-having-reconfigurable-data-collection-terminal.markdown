title: Data collection system having reconfigurable data collection terminal
abstract: There is provided in one embodiment a data collection system including a data collection terminal having an encoded information reader device and a computer spaced apart from the data collection terminal. The data collection terminal in one embodiment can be configured to be responsive to configuration data expressed in an extensible markup language. The computer in one embodiment can use an existing extensible markup language document to create a data entry screen to received desired parameter settings for the data collection terminal within data entry fields of the data entry screen. The computer can further combine the extensible markup language document with the desired parameter settings to create configuration data and can initiate a transfer of the configuration data to the data collection terminal. The computer in one embodiment can be used to create for transfer to the data collection terminal a data package including file data corresponding to one or more selected files, together with additional data. The system provided can be used to transfer data, including but not limited to configuration data, between computers that are not data collection terminals and which are devoid of encoded information reader devices.
