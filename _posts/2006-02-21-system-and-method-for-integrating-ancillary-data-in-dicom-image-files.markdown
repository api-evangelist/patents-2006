No. 60 670 326 filed on Apr. 12 2005 and entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR INTEGRATING ANCILLARY DATA IN DICOM IMAGE FILES III the entire contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates generally to medical image records and more particularly with providing DICOM image files with medical information received from at least one or more sources.

The Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine DICOM standard was created by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association NEMA for improving distribution and access of medical images such as CT scans MRI and x rays. Accordingly contemporary medical imaging uses the DICOM image format for the transport and storage of medical images. The DICOM image format arose in an attempt to standardize the image format of different machine vendors i.e. GE Hitachi Philips to promote compatibility such that machines provided by competing vendors could transmit and receive information between them. This original goal for the DICOM format has achieved varying degrees of success.

Over time the DICOM standard has become the de facto standard for the format used for medical images that are electronically transferred from one place to another. DICOM files have found particular use in the field of teleradiology. As used herein the term teleradiology refers to generally the practice of reading a medical image at a location that is remote from the location where a medical examination was performed or where the medical image related to the examination was acquired. Typically the image is electronically transferred to the location where it is eventually read.

Teleradiologists i.e. physicians who read and or interpret medical images at a remote location have encountered a major obstacle regarding images formatted according to the DICOM standard. Accurate interpretations of medical images require that the radiologist be aware of related patient information submitted by the referring physician. For example a radiologist requires information regarding the patient s medical history and perhaps information regarding the technologist and or physician who performed the medical examination. The radiologist and patient will also benefit from having the referring physician s address telephone and fax information readily available in order to communicate urgent findings or for use in secondary data feeds such as the known Health Level 7 HL 7 protocol. As known to those skilled in the art HL 7 is a standardized data protocol for data transmitted within the healthcare industry. Unfortunately such information is not typically available and teleradiologists often encounter an obstacle because they cannot interpret patient examinations accurately in a vacuum.

In the prior art the DICOM image format provides for the entry of brief patient histories usually by the technologist and may also provide a patient work list by the technologist that includes patient history and or physician information. However in practice such information is often not provided or used as intended. This occurs typically because technologists who are time constrained tend to omit data entry tasks that they perceive as overly time consuming and they rationalize that the radiologist who eventually reads and interprets the medical image s already has or can gain access easily to the patient s chart should the radiologist require more information than provided in the DICOM file. Unfortunately this assumption is often false especially in a teleradiology practice when the patient s chart may be located hundreds or thousands of miles from the location where the teleradiologist actually interprets the medical image and or examination.

Solutions to problems associated with a teleradiologist requiring more information than is provided in a DICOM file have for the most part taken the form of faxing or scanning handwritten clinical data i.e. paperwork to the teleradiologist. In the case of scanning paperwork is typically entered in a flatbed or sheet fed scanner and the scanned electronic image s of the paperwork is uploaded to a computer such as to a server configured to receive files via the file transfer protocol FTP . The scanned paperwork can then be transmitted to a remote computer and made available to the teleradiologist.

Unfortunately such prior art solutions are cumbersome and often untenable especially in cases involving more than just a few patients. Accordingly some prior art software vendors providing DICOM files have incorporated some type of image capture software in their software packages that provides for scanning and electronically integrating the scanned material into the DICOM image file. This prior art software however is typically designed for capturing secondary medical images and not paperwork. Also such software can be quite cumbersome to use and require many complex steps. Further technologists who operate medical image software programs vary widely in their abilities to use difficult software. Many are unable to use the software successfully for various reasons including respective skill levels.

Most teleradiologists agree that an ideal scenario involves the simultaneous viewing of hand written paper data when medical images are being viewed and interpreted. This is preferred over reviewing paper data not as a separate task. To date little has been done to facilitate this goal.

The foregoing illustrates the need for a system and method that automatically generates DICOM files comprised of information provided in non digital paperwork and patient histories submitted by the patient and referring physician to the radiologist. Further the invention preferably integrates DICOM files with ancillary information which may otherwise be absent from an original DICOM image file such as provided by the referring physician name and address.

A system and method is further provided that enables a user to easily select from a list of patients and that converts files from a first format such as the Joint Photographic Experts Group JPEG format to a DICOM format using DICOM tags and data of the selected patient s imaging examination to marry this information to the imaging examination. A system and method is further provided that that runs in an automatic mode without substantial user intervention and without requiring any special equipment such as a flatbed scanner but rather uses readily available equipment such as a fax machine to directly integrate patient e.g. medical information into the DICOM image examination.

Accordingly the present invention comprises a system and method for integrating electronic patient information with a medical image file. In one embodiment at least one information processor is provided that is operable to communicate over a communication network. A database is provided on the at least one information processor wherein the database is operable to store electronic patient information representing a plurality of patients and further to store respective image files representing patient medical examinations. Moreover a receiving module is preferably included that is operable to receive over the communication network an image file representing a patient medical examination. The image file is preferably formatted with a respective filename.

Also a converting module is provided that is operable to convert the image file by associating the image file with at least one tag wherein the converting module refers to at least the respective filename to associate the image with the tag s . The tag s are associated with the image file to associate the medical image record with the electronic patient information for a respective patient. A storage module is further operable to store the converted image to the database. Preferably the modules operate substantially without human intervention.

In alternative embodiments the receiving module is operable to receive electronic textual information and an adder module is operable to integrate the electronic textual information with the image file. Also in an alternative embodiment a fax module is operable to receive a fax cover page that comprises a bar code that is read by the fax module and used to associate electronic information in pages following the fax cover page with the image file.

In still alternative embodiments a display module is provided that enables a user to review the image file integrated with the electronic textual information. Further a graphical user interface is preferably provided that enables a user to supply parameters to the modules and to invoke the modules.

The present invention comprises a system and method for incorporating paperwork handwritten analog clinical patient information into digital DICOM image files for interpretation by the radiologist or other physician. In an example embodiment the present invention comprises a suite of software modules which reads and incorporates paperwork handwritten analog clinical patient information directly integrating them into the DICOM image examination files.

In an example embodiment of the present invention patient demographic information is output as a separate file after a patient examination file is acquired by a DICOM server. This output file comprised of key available DICOM tags contains demographic information of the patient along with detailed information regarding the examination itself. A key indexing number for example labeled the Study UID number is preferably included among these DICOM tags in the output file. The present invention imports the output file from either a remote FTP site or a local folder either in an automated fashion or by user intervention with a GUI. Of course one skilled in the art will recognize that other methods and locations for transferring and or receiving electronic files are known and are envisioned in the present invention. The present invention differs from prior art methods in its ability to utilize the DICOM tags and in particular the STUDY UID tag and to have the analog data become a part of the original DICOM image examination rather than merely an attachment to it.

The following discussion regards example software modules which are represented in the block diagram shown in and operable in an embodiment of the present invention. The following discussion of example software modules makes reference to example display screens shown in . In accordance with a preferred embodiment many of the screen displays provided by the present invention are formatted as graphical controls such as textboxes checkboxes dropdown lists pushbuttons radio buttons or the like. Many of the display screens provided by the present invention are operable as data entry forms and information provided in the form is preferably stored in database . Of course one skilled in the art will recognize that the example modules and corresponding names are illustrative and that various other designs names and modules may be fashioned depending upon a particular embodiment of the present invention.

Module AUTOSENDIMG determines when an image file such as a TIFF file or JPEG file is stored in a specified file folder. When an image file is recognized module preferably converts it to DICOM format and transmits the formatted file to DICOM Server . In a preferred embodiment module recognizes when the name of the image file employs a particular format such as PatientName PatientID StudyUID e.g. names of data fields that represent a patient and study and module preferably uses these data when converting an image file to the DICOM format. Moreover module preferably references an American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII text file e.g. named config.txt in order to retrieve and add information such as Institution Name Study Description and Modality.

In accordance with the MICROSOFT WINDOWS operating system module preferably operates as a background application and is represented by an icon in the toolbar. When the icon is selected a user interface substantially as shown in is displayed. As shown in selecting hide button causes display screen to be removed from view e.g. referred to in the art as being minimized . Selecting About button displays textual information regarding module and selecting the End button terminates module . In addition parameters are preferably defined by a user and referenced by module Path name IP address Port Number Local Entity Title and DICOM server Entity Title . For example Path name represents a folder that is used by module to determine where an image file that requires conversion to DICOM format is stored. IP Address represents the IP address of the DICOM Server where the image file properly formatted in the DICOM format is to be transmitted. Port Number represents the port number of the DICOM Server . Local Entity Title and Server Entity Title represent the respectively designated names of the local computer system and the remote server .

Continuing with reference to DICOMPush module preferably transmits images formatted as DICOM images from path name to DICOM server . Module preferably operates as a background application and is represented by an icon in the toolbar. Once the icon is selected a user interface substantially as shown in is provided. illustrate example display screens provided by module that correspond to respective tabs for entering changing and viewing information directed to a patient study institution and or image as selected in tab section . Also illustrated is buttons section that includes plurality of buttons for invoking various processes provided by module . For example buttons are provided to enable a user to load a file perform a query send a file setup module review information regarding module and terminate module .

Referring back to another module provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment is DICOMTag2Text module which is operable to provide various functionality in accordance with the teachings herein. In one embodiment module generates tagged data files that are MEDWEB compliant using data provided in an EFILM database. In an alternative embodiment module generates tagged data files that are MEDWEB compliant using data provided in an CONQUEST database. Alternatively module generates PDF fax cover pages using data provided in an EFILM database or generates PDF fax cover pages using data provided in an CONQUEST database. In yet another alternative module generates tagged data files directly from the user s console that are MEDWEB compliant using data provided in an EFILM database. In yet another embodiment module generates tagged data files directly from the user s console that are MEDWEB compliant using data provided in an CONQUEST database or generates PDF fax cover pages directly from the user s console using data provided in an MEDWEB tagged file.

In a preferred embodiment the present invention provides data in a format for a database accessible by information processor and not particular to CONQUEST or EFILM. By using an internal database that is continually updated via DICOM queries to the DICOM server the overall process is streamlined by not having to transmit an entire DICOM examination to the CONQUEST or EFILM database in order to produce the PDF fax cover sheets. or HTI text files. Further by substituting repeated DICOM queries to the target DICOM server instead of automatically transmitting the entire examination a significant bandwidth transmittal time and storage space savings is produced. The query process asks the target DICOM server if any new studies have arrived. If the results to the query indicates new studies the relevant DICOM tags are pulled from the new study and added to the internal database. Thereafter the relevant DICOM tags for the examination are transmitted instead of the entire examination which may include hundreds of images. The inventor believes this is the most parsimonious approach toward updating the local internal database and allows use of this single database for all relevant modules.

As used herein the console refers generally to a command line such as invoked from the MICROSOFT WINDOWS command prompt also known in the industry as a C prompt. One skilled in the art will recognize that the letter C can be substituted for any other respective drive letter and that any operating system such as UNIX which provides a prompt for command line execution is applicable herein.

In a preferred embodiment tagged file formats and Acrobat PDF Fax Cover files are provided according to predetermined specifications that correspond with the particular format for the data. For example one type of query may be provided for EFILM data files and another type of query may be provided for CONQUEST data files. Preferably queries are formatted for a database maintained by information processor such as a MICROSOFT ACCESS or other SQL compliant database.

Continuing with reference to Fields and Tags are provided in an editable grid where Fields represents a database field name and Tags represents the corresponding tag to be used. In a preferred embodiment database field names use SQL like syntaxes. For example TableName.FieldName. i.e. Patient.PatientID indicates the data field PatientID defined in a database table Patient. Tasks control panel contains two checkboxes the first Tagged File Output selects output to tagged files and the second PDF Generation selects output to PDF files. Additionally save settings button when selected saves the current settings. Start button when selected preferably causes information processor to start execution of DICOMTag2Text module using the respective values defined in display screen . Stop button when selected preferably halts execution of DICOMTag2Text module . All graphic user interface settings are persistent in disk such that closing module does not result in the loss of the values. When module executes in the future the settings are loaded automatically. In addition to graphic screen controls display screen preferably provides status information such as displayed in at the bottom of display screen.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention selecting the cross icon in the upper right corner of display screen does not result in termination of the module . Instead selecting the cross icon merely minimizes the window to the toolbar near the clock. In order to close terminate module the user preferably selects e.g. right clicks on the tray icon and a pop up menu is shown such as illustrated in .

As noted above the present invention is operable by executing console commands at a command line prompt. The following are example parameters that are meaningful when invoking module via the console. In a preferred embodiment one parameter is used at a time. In a preferred embodiment all of the parameters submitted via the graphic user interface such as illustrated in can be defined and applied while operating module from the console.

Referring back to the present invention further includes DICOMadder module that preferably reads demographic patient information from a data file. is a flow chart that illustrates steps associated with processing a file in accordance with module . At step a data file becomes available to module after a patient examination is acquired by a DICOM server . The data file preferably includes information regarding the patient along with detailed information on the examination itself. Module reads this file either directly from an ftp folder or a local folder. Module then provides a pull down menu for the user containing a patient list step . Any paper that is scanned for example via a sheet fed or auto feed TWAIN scanner is preferably associated with a particular patient examination by module step . Module thereafter automatically uploads the data file to the DICOM server as part of the imaging examination step . At step the examination is available for viewing for example by a radiologist for interpretation and the clinical patient paperwork displays simultaneously as a separate DICOM series. In this way the present invention allows for the viewing of patient information at the same time as digital images.

In a preferred embodiment each feature available via DICOMadder module preferably performs one or more functions related to the task of attaching non DICOM paperwork clinical data to a DICOM examination. Some can be run concurrently with each other. Others have special functions such as allowing entry of certain DICOM tags as part of the conversion or allow e mail attachments in TIFF JPEG format to automatically convert itself to DICOM format. Using various combinations of these utilities and applications allows for different hardware and software configurations to carry out the process of adding non digital patient data directly to specific DICOM image examinations.

One feature associated with DICOMadder module uses JPEG files from a twain scanner fax transmission email attachments or JPEG print drivers and attaches the converted DICOM file to the appropriate DICOM examination. DICOMfaxadder module described below automatically attaches faxed paperwork to a DICOM examination. Further a DICOMadder module software library is DICOMtags2txt. This application produces the required patient data file for the DICOMadder and produces the cover sheet for the DICOMfaxadder application. DICOMTag2Text module allows the use of EFILM CONQUEST DICOM or other database servers to be used to produce demographics and other materials required by DICOMadder module and DICOMfaxadder module in order to make the demographics and materials universally compatible with any commercially available DICOM server.

Other modules or utilities provided via DICOMadder module run concurrently or separately from DICOMadder module and DICOMfaxadder module and DICOMTag2Text module . These utilities do ancillary jobs such as auto uploading data to DICOM server acting as file daemons to monitor folders for new data and automatically processing or uploading the data for conversion of TIFF or JPEG format scanned files to DICOM files. The utilities also allow the addition of referring physician information address phone fax to the DICOM examination if this data is lacking and is meant to be used by administrative personnel to add this information to the DICOM file if it is missing from the original DICOM worklist. Using various custom combinations of these utilities and applications allows for different hardware and software DICOM server configurations to carry out the process of adding non digital patient data directly to specific DICOM image examinations.

Thus DICOMadder module reads certain demographic patient information from a data file. This data file becomes available to the DICOMadder module as soon as a patient examination is acquired by a DICOM server . The data file includes information on the patient along with detailed information on the examination itself. The DICOMadder can read this file either directly from an ftp folder or a local folder. It then provides a pull down menu for the user containing a patient list and allows papers scanned from a sheet fed or auto feed TWAIN scanner to be associated with a particular patient examination and automatically uploaded to the DICOM server as part of the imaging examination. The end result is when the examination is opened by the radiologist for interpretation the clinical patient paperwork displays simultaneously as a separate DICOM series allowing the viewing of patient information at the same time as the digital images.

Also referring to the present invention preferably provides DICOMfaxadder module that enables direct or remote scanning of non digital paper based patient data directly into DICOM imaging examinations. In a preferred embodiment fax server receives fax cover pages that are generated with a barcode. The fax is processed by our software in a similar way as scanned paperwork is processed by the DICOMadder module . is a flow chart illustrated that illustrates steps associated with the workflow in accordance with module . At step the facsimile cover page comprising a bar code is produced by ancillary software. The fax cover page containing the bar code is then either automatically uploaded to an FTP server for download by the remote examination site personnel automatically printed at the examination site via a remote internet printing application or automatically faxed to the examination site directly. A technologist at the remote examination site then uses the fax cover sheet to transmit corresponding patient paperwork via a simple fax machine to server . The end result is that users can fax the patient paperwork directly into the patients DICOM examination. This application obviates the need for paper scanners and capture programs and greatly simplifies the addition of non digital handwritten patient information to the DICOM examination.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment another module DICOMProxy module is provided that functions in conjunction with a DICOM Storage SCP Service Class Provider receives an image via a DICOM communication modifies the DICOM tags for the examination following various criteria and then forwards the modified examination to the DICOM Storage SCP. The various criteria for modifying the image comprises matching a DICOM tag for example Institution Name with a list of words. If there is a match the module modifies one or more DICOM tags such as Accession Number and Institution Name. Also the matching image may be transmitted to a new destination that corresponds with an IP address and port number that corresponds with the matching word achieving a rerouting of the examination based upon predefined criteria present in the DICOM tags.

Preferably the present invention comprises various modules which can run concurrently or separately from DICOMadder module . These ancillary modules do the jobs of auto uploading to the DICOM server watching folders for new data to be automatically processed or uploaded and converting TIFF or JPEG format scanned files to DICOM files which can then be processed by the DICOMadder application or one of the other applications in the library substantially as described herein. Ancillary software also allows the addition of referring physician information address phone and fax to the DICOM examination if this data is lacking and is meant to be used by administrative to add this information to the DICOM file if it is missing from the original worklist.

Other ancillary applications in the DICOMadder library produce the patient data file for the DICOMadder module and produces the cover sheet for the DICOMfaxadder module . Although some DICOM server produces this file automatically i.e. MEDWEB other DICOM servers do not. The present invention preferably provides EFILM and CONQUEST DICOM servers to be used to produce similar demographics so that DICOMadder module and DICOMfaxadder module can be universally used with any commercially available DICOM server.

Features of DICOMfaxadder module is provided below with reference to and in reference to an embodiment of the present invention.

In a preferred embodiment DICOMFaxAdder module is a command line console application that is called by the fax server application programming interface API . DICOMFaxAdder module is designed to work in tandem with the DICOMTag2Text module . Module receives parameters from fax server including for example path folder patient name barcode IP address of the DICOM Server port number of the DICOM Server local Application Entity name and remote Application Entity name.

Thus DICOMfaxadder module preferably reads a TIFF file from the respective folder and subsequently queries an E FILM database and creates a DICOM archive that preferably sends a fax to DICOM Server . The fax preferably has attached the appropriate patient examination as an additional examination series. The workflow is as follows the specially barcoded cover page is produced by the DICOMtag2text module .

Ancillary software also allows the addition of referring physician information address phone fax to the DICOM file if examination data are lacking and are meant to be used by ancillary personnel e.g. secretaries or assistants to the teleradiologist to add this information. This feature is significant particularly for bi directional HL 7 feeds. The present invention preferably includes a module that uses an HL 7 feed for speech recognition transcription. For example if a DICOM patient file contains the referring physician address and telephone fax information the proper header is substantially automatically produced by a module included with the speech recognition software and is preferably entered as part of the actual radiology report and automatically faxed to the referring physician.

Other ancillary software modules of the present invention perform such functions as producing the required patient output file described above . The present invention supports a variety of DICOM servers that receive and digitize medical imaging examinations as DICOM files. For example the present invention allows the use of EFILM MEDWEB and CONQUEST DICOM servers to be used to produce similar databases such that the present invention can be universally used.

Another feature of the present invention provided via a hardware software module includes a patient information facsimile fax module. Preferably a dedicated fax server is provided which supports the use of a printed barcode on the cover page of a fax. The barcode is derived from the DICOM tag database of the DICOM image examination. The barcode is preferably read and used to automatically name the fax substantially when received and automatically formats the fax as a named TIFF file and thereafter attaches the TIFF file to an encrypted e mail letter. In an example embodiment the fax is processed in a similar way as the scanned paperwork described above .

In an example embodiment of the fax module of the present invention the workflow is as follows a barcode cover page is substantially automatically produced by the present invention when an imaging study is received by for example the DICOM server. The cover page is then either 1 automatically uploaded to an FTP site for download by the examination site personnel 2 automatically printed at the examination site for example via an internet printing application or 3 automatically faxed to the examination site directly. The technologist at the examination site then uses this specially encoded cover sheet to send the corresponding patient paperwork via a typical fax machine to a server operating the present invention. In this way the present invention enables a remote site to fax paperwork directly into the patient s DICOM examination file. By enabling technologists to fax paperwork the need for paper scanners and capture programs is obviated and the process of providing non digital handwritten patient information to the DICOM examination and ultimately to the interpreting physician is greatly simplified.

Continuing with reference to display screen includes drop down list that allows a user to select a specific patient. After a patient is selected information is preferably displayed in section which represents the patient s medical identification number the modality of the medical image e.g. CT x ray or MRI and the date time the image was generated. When the user is satisfied that the correct patient is selected the user selects Transfer Syntax to choose a transfer syntax for the created DICOM file s . As shown in the transfer syntaxes provided by the present invention include explicit VR JPEG lossy little endian explicit VR uncompressed little endian and implicit VR uncompressed little endian. All of these represent standard DICOM transfer protocols and syntax. In the example shown in the default selection is the implicit VR syntax. After the user has selected the patient and the transfer syntax the user preferably opens one or more JPEG files via file menu in order to convert the JPEG file to DICOM format using the data of the selected patient as the DICOM tags.

For example the menu items File Open displays an open file dialog box. The user selects one or multiple using the CTRL or SHIFT key JPEG files. After closing the open dialog by clicking on the OK button the selected JPEG files are converted to the DICOM standard. The data of the selected patient are included in each DICOM file and the DICOM files are stored on the user s computer system for example in a directory location named c CONVERTOUT. In a preferred embodiment successfully converted JPEG files are automatically deleted and the user is notified of the success or failure of the operation.

Also as displayed in update button can be selected to reload patient data from the FTP server or user s local computer system depending upon the location where patient information is stored. This feature is useful for updating patient information e.g. demographics over time and to provide DICOM files that contain current patient information.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the user can configure the present invention to identify the locations of data that are used for generating DICOM files substantially as described herein. The user can configure the present invention by selecting the menu entry choice Options Configure as shown in . After correctly entering the password the present invention preferably displays the Configuration Dialog screen as shown in .

Institution filtering is used to restrict the retrieval of patient data that comply with institutional information defined by the user. In particular to configure an Institution Filter the user preferably enters a character string in the Institution Name textbox. As shown in the user selects radio button controls for no filtering any data file is available match whole string Institution Name in data file must be equal to entered Institution name or match part of string Institution Name in data file must contain entered value as substring . In an example embodiment filtering is case sensitive. This feature is important to preserve patient confidentiality.

As noted above the present invention supports patient data that are stored locally in case the user desires not to connect to an FTP server in order to retrieve patient data. As shown in in case the checkbox Read data from FTP server is not checked the user is able to navigate or browse to a local folder that contains the patient data file s . This folder will be used for storing and retrieving the data files.

Another option provided in display screen is the ability to change a user s password e.g. by selecting the change password Change button . A dialog box requires the user to enter an old password once and the new password twice. After confirmation the new password is active.

After the user is satisfied with the configuration settings provided in display screen the user applies the changes. The user preferably selects the button labeled OK to apply the changes of the configuration. Alternatively the Cancel button closes the configuration dialog without modifying the configuration.

Thus the present invention enables users to retrieve patient information and digital forms of paperwork to provide DICOM files that integrate paperwork with medical image records.

In an effort to improve the flexibility and availability of the present invention an internet based embodiment is preferably provided on information processor and available for users establishing a communication session with information processor using standard web browsing software. illustrate example display screens and reports that are provided in accordance with an internet web based embodiment of the present invention.

Thus as shown in the example display screens A F the present invention provides a convenient and secure internet based embodiment that is operable using standard web browser software.

A discussion regarding technical details regarding an embodiment of the present invention is now provided to further describe the invention.

The present invention contains an interface as a COM and Automation Server COM refers herein to the known Component Object Model . The interface enables a technical user to remotely control the present invention without the need for an interactive session substantially as described. For example one or more computer software programs or scripts can be developed to automate the functions and configuration of the present invention.

More particularly a user can employ one or more automation functions to define various features of the present invention that are to be performed automatically. The following example lists functions that are provided in an example embodiment of the present invention SetInputFolder SetOutputFolder SetLookupTable SetErrorFolder SetTransferSyntax and ProcessFolder. Other functions not listed herein are envisioned which support other functionality of the present invention and is or will become apparent to one skilled in the art. A brief description of the above listed functions is provided below.

The SetInputFolder function enables a user to define an input folder or location on a computer system where JPEG files are to be expected and once retrieved to be converted to DICOM. In an example embodiment the following syntax is used int SetInputFolder BSTR DirName . As used in an example embodiment DirName indicates the path or the directory where the JPEG files are stored. Preferably DirName is formatted as an absolute path name. If SetInputFolder succeeds the computer system preferably returns a value of 0 otherwise an Errorcode is returned 1 in case the specified folder does not exist.

The SetOutputFolder function enables a user to define an output folder or location on a computer system where the converted DICOM files are to be stored. In an example embodiment the following syntax is used int SetOutputFolder BSTR DirName . As used in an example embodiment DirName indicates the path of the target directory for the DICOM files. Preferably DirName is formatted as an absolute path name. If SetOutputFolder succeeds the computer system preferably returns a value of 0 otherwise an Errorcode is returned 1 in case the folder does not exist.

The SetLookupTable function enables a user to define the path of a lookup table that maps the variable siteIDs to Institution Names. In an example embodiment the following syntax is used int SetLookupTable BSTR FileName . As used in an example embodiment FileName indicates the path where a filename of a lookup table file is stored. If SetLookupTable succeeds the computer system returns a value of 0 otherwise an Errorcode is returned 2 in case the file does not exist or 3 in case the file could not be parsed.

The SetErrorFolder function enables a user to define an error folder where JPEG files are to be copied in case no matching data file can be found on an FTP server. In an example embodiment the following syntax is used int SetErrorFolder BSTR DirName . As used in an example embodiment DirName indicates the path of the directory where JPEG files without a match are located. If SetErrorFolder succeeds the computer system returns a value of 0 otherwise an Errorcode is returned 1 in case the folder does not exist.

The SetTransferSyntax function enables a user to define which transfer syntax shall be used with the present invention. In an example embodiment the following syntax is used int SetTransferSyntax int Value . As used in an example embodiment Value represents a number that specifies the transfer syntax according the following Value VR Compression Byte Order 0 explicit JPEG lossy little endian 1 explicit none little endian 2 implicit none little endian. On success the SetTransferSyntax functions causes the computer system to return the value for the TransferSyntax otherwise an error code is returned 6 in case the value for the TransferSyntax is out of range.

The ProcessFolder function enables a user to convert JPEG files in the inputfolder to DICOM and to apply the information of the matching data files on the FTP server. In an example embodiment the following syntax is used int ProcessFolder . If ProcessFolder succeeds the computer system returns the number of successfully converted files otherwise an Errorcode is returned 3 in case no lookup file is available 4 in case any of the required folders wasn t defined or doesn t exist 5 in case no access to the data files was possible FTP connection or access failed or no access to file system folder 6 in case if no supported TransferSyntax is specified.

Of course one skilled in the art will recognize that the functions described above illustrate ways to automate tasks and configuration of the present invention. Other functions and techniques will become apparent to one skilled in the art for providing features such as described herein.

Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred therefore that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein.
