The invention was made with Government support under contract No. FA8802 04 C 0001 by the Department of the Air Force. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The invention relates generally to receiver systems and in particular to receiver systems with multiple antennas.

For certain applications such as launch vehicle tracking a full view of the complete sky is not always available using a single antenna. For example a Global Positioning System GPS receiver may not be able to receive signals from an adequate number of satellites to perform an accurate position computation. When this is the case multiple antennas may be required.

As between the two systems the receiving system is the least expensive approach but leads to signal drop outs due to the antenna interference patterns . The receiving system can provide better antenna pattern coverage than the receiving system but is likely to be more expensive because multiple GPS receivers or correlators are required.

It would be useful to be able to provide a receiving system solution that is simpler and less expensive than using multiple correlators or receivers and minimizes the interference problem associated with combining the signals from multiple antennas into a single receiver.

Embodiments of receiver systems and methods described herein utilize switched combined antenna elements to receive signals e.g. GPS satellite signals when a clear view of the complete sky is not available using a single antenna element . In an example application two or more antenna elements are mounted on the surface of an object such as a launch vehicle or other projectile. However it should be appreciated that the principles described herein are also applicable to two or more antenna elements that may be mounted on more than a single object. Furthermore the antenna elements can be mounted to objects other than launch vehicles or projectiles.

The use of switched combined antenna elements in embodiments described herein provides a receiver solution that is simpler and less expensive than prior receiver systems using multiple correlators or receivers and minimizes or decreases the interference problem associated with combining signals from multiple antennas into a single receiver.

Relative to the conventional receiver system the receiver system is only slightly more expensive and eliminates or substantially eliminates performance degradation associated with the interference patterns of multiple antenna elements. Additionally the receiver system is likely to be less expensive than the conventional receiver system because only one receiver is required. Furthermore relative to the conventional receiver system the receiver system provides 3 dB higher gain at angles midway between the boresights of each pair of antenna elements.

In an example embodiment a receiving method includes combining outputs of two or more antenna elements to generate sum and difference signals and sequentially switching between the sum and difference signals to provide inputs to a receiver. In an example embodiment the switching occurs at a substantially constant rate. In an example embodiment the switching is substantially periodic.

In another example embodiment a receiving method includes providing a launch vehicle with two or more antenna elements combining outputs of the two or more antenna elements to generate sum and difference signals and switching between the sum and difference signals to provide inputs to a global positioning system GPS receiver.

Embodiments described herein involve the use of a combiner and toggle switch between multiple antenna elements and a single receiver. Embodiments described herein utilize a switch and combiner in between a GPS receiver and multiple antenna elements to eliminate signal drop outs and increase signal gain at minimum cost and are implemented with minimum complexity.

Embodiments described herein exploit the increased gain that occurs when signals from two or more antennas are combined. This typically provides at least 3 dB more gain than the conventional systems which do not utilize signal combining. Embodiments described herein exploit the relationship between the sum and difference patterns of two antennas. The local maxima of the sum pattern of two antennas occur at exactly the same angles as the local minima of the difference pattern and the local maxima of the difference pattern occur at exactly the same angles as the local minima of the sum pattern. The toggle switch provides the receiver with both the sum and difference patterns so that the receiver periodically has access to a strong signal and therefore drop outs due to the antenna interference effect are eliminated or substantially eliminated. Due to the unique nature of GPS signal processing there is no system performance degradation and no information is lost during switching periods when the output of the toggle switch is connected to neither the sum nor the difference outputs of the hybrid as long as these time periods are sufficiently small an objective easily achievable with modern electronic switches. Embodiments described herein facilitate obtaining a full view of the sky using multiple GPS antennas at a lower cost and with improved performance.

In an example embodiment a receiving system includes a combiner configured to receive signals from two or more antenna elements and to generate sum and difference outputs and a switch configured to sequentially provide the sum and difference outputs as inputs to a receiver. In an example embodiment the combiner is a microwave hybrid combiner. In an example embodiment the two or more antenna elements are positioned on a launch vehicle. In an example embodiment the switch is configured to sequence through the sum and difference outputs at a substantially constant rate. In an example embodiment the switch is configured to sequence through the sum and difference outputs in a substantially periodic manner. In an example embodiment the switch is a toggle switch. In an example embodiment the switch is a single pole double throw SPDT switch. In an example embodiment the receiver is a global positioning system GPS receiver.

In an example embodiment a receiving system includes a sum and difference combiner configured to receive signals from two or more antenna elements and to generate combiner outputs a receiver and means for selectively providing the combiner outputs as inputs to the receiver. In an example embodiment the sum and difference combiner is a microwave hybrid combiner. In an example embodiment the two or more antenna elements are positioned on a launch vehicle. In an example embodiment the receiver is a global positioning system GPS receiver. In an example embodiment the means for selectively providing the combiner outputs is configured to sequence through the combiner outputs at a substantially constant rate. In an example embodiment the means for selectively providing the combiner outputs is configured to sequence through the combiner outputs in a substantially periodic manner. In an example embodiment the means for selectively providing the combiner outputs includes a toggle switch.

It is intended that the scope of the present invention extend to all such modifications and or additions.
