The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 884 489 issued on Dec. 5 1989 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 856 630 issued on Jan. 5 1999 disclose electromagnetic EM guns and are incorporated by reference herein. The launcher barrel of an EM gun typically comprises a pair of rails separated by a pair of insulators. The interior surfaces of the rails and the insulators form a bore for an armature. During firing of an EM gun the rails are stressed in a direction away from the bore while the insulators are usually not stressed. Minimizing rail deflection is an inherent problem in EM guns given that only the rails and not the insulators are loaded during firing. This uneven loading results in the EM launcher cross section deforming into an elongated oval shape.

Traditionally EM launchers have relied on prestress to minimize rail deflection. Some methods of obtaining this prestress have included clamped steel laminates pressure cured epoxy laminates hydraulically prestressed composites and bolted prestressed steel laminates. In a prestressed design the load on the rails pushes against the applied prestress in addition to pushing against the stiffness of the materials therefore lessening the deflection of the rails.

The methods for achieving the prestress are not easy to implement. The methods often result in very heavy guns suitable only for laboratory use. Additionally for guns not confined to a laboratory setting insulators with good compression strength are required to achieve the desired prestress levels. This normally resulted in large insulators and an overall oval design for the launcher. The oval design by itself results in extra rail deflection because as the jacket is loaded it flattens itself out by compressing the insulators towards the bore.

It is a further object of the invention to provide an EM gun that is lighter in weight than known EM guns.

One aspect of the invention is an electromagnetic launcher having a longitudinal axis and comprising a pair of longitudinally extending rails a pair of longitudinally extending insulators disposed between the rails a bore defined by interior surfaces of the rails and the insulators and a jacket extending around exterior surfaces of the rails and the insulators wherein the exterior surfaces of the insulators are substantially flat and further wherein a distance between the exterior surfaces of the insulators is substantially equal to or less than a maximum thickness of the rails.

In one embodiment a modulus of elasticity of the jacket is at least 20 10psi. The interior surfaces of the jacket preferably include 1 substantially flat surfaces that mate with the exterior surfaces of the insulators and 2 curved surfaces that mate with the exterior surfaces of the rails.

In a preferred embodiment the exterior surfaces of the rails are substantially semi circular. The diameters of the substantially semi circular exterior surfaces of the rails are substantially equal to the maximum thickness of the rails.

Another aspect of the invention is an electromagnetic launcher having a longitudinal axis and comprising a pair of longitudinally extending rails a jacket extending around exterior surfaces of the rails and a bore defined by interior surfaces of the rails and the jacket wherein portions of the interior surface of the jacket that define the bore are substantially flat and further wherein a difference between a distance between the substantially flat portions of the interior surface of the jacket and a maximum thickness of the rails is a minimum distance that ensures a projectile does not contact the jacket.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

During operation the electromagnetic forces that propel the projectile also tend to push the rails apart as shown by the arrows F in . This in turn causes compressive forces on the external surfaces of the insulators . The combination of forces causes distortion of the bore . If the rails are pushed apart the armature will lose electrical contact thereby reducing the effectiveness of the launcher .

Launcher relies in part on geometric considerations rather than prestress to minimize deflection of the rails . The stiffness of jacket rather than prestress mitigates the deflection of rails . By flattening out the traditional oval shape on the insulator exterior surfaces the jacket is placed in tension quickly and cannot elongate simply by flattening itself out as in traditional designs. Additionally the distance d between the external surfaces of the insulators is substantially equal to or less than the maximum thickness t of the rails so that any flattening loads are resisted by the rails and not by the insulators .

In launcher the importance of the insulators is reduced to acting as spacers and bore riding surfaces for protecting the jacket . In launcher the insulators are required to carry the compression loading of the prestress. This requires that insulators have good compression strength resulting in thick insulators . In launcher the insulators need only be thick enough for assembly purposes and for providing a good bore riding surface. In fact if the projectile could be constrained from ever touching the insulators then the insulators could be eliminated.

Launcher may use smaller rails than launcher . In launcher the rails have to be large enough to interface with the insulators . The contact area between the insulators and rails has to be large enough to allow for proper prestress load transfer between the rails and insulators . As the insulator size increases to handle the prestress loads the rail size must also increase. The elimination of the prestress allows for smaller insulators and thus smaller rails . The rails only need to be slightly larger than the bore to allow for placement of insulators as a spacer.

The aggregate advantages of launcher result in a more compact lighter weight apparatus. By reducing the size of the insulators and rails the weight of the launcher is reduced. Additionally the size of the jacket can be reduced if the goal is simply to meet the same rail deflections as a traditional design.

The insulators are primarily used as spacers for assembly purposes and as a riding surface so that the projectile cannot contact the jacket directly. Insulators are not part of the load structure. Any non electrically conductive material can be used for the insulators . The thickness of the insulators is chosen based on ease of manufacture and assembly needs. Additionally issues of wear may determine how thick the insulators should be. If using a projectile that will not contact the insulators at all the insulators can be removed after assembly as they are no longer required to protect the jacket .

The rails deliver the electric current to the projectile. Launcher will work with virtually any rail material. The specific material used is a trade off between stiffness density and electrical properties. As seen in interior surfaces of the rails are the contact zone between the rails and the projectile not shown . If insulators are used the thickness t of the rails should be the contact distance c plus the thickness of the insulators . If insulators are not used then the thickness of the rails should be just enough larger than the contact distance c to ensure that the projectile will not contact the jacket .

The curvature of the exterior surfaces of the rails is chosen such that it is either tangent to or becomes flat just before contacting the insulators . A small flat surface before the rails contact the insulators ensures that any compression force applied by the jacket is resisted by the rails and not the insulators . In the exterior surfaces of the rails are semicircles that are tangent to the insulators where the rails meet the insulators. The semicircles have a radius of R as shown in .

The rail insulator interface is used for assembly purposes. In a self fixturing design is shown. However the details of the rail insulator interface are not important as long as the insulators keep the rails properly spaced during assembly of the jacket . Any rail insulator interface design that maintains proper spacing during assembly is sufficient. If no insulators are needed then a removable spacer may be used to keep the rails properly spaced during assembly.

The jacket controls the deflection of rails . The jacket is of a sufficient stiffness and strength to maintain the desired rail deflections. High modulus lightweight composite materials are ideal materials for jacket . The modulus of elasticity is preferably at least 20 10psi. Also laminated steel disks may be used if deflection is more of a concern than weight.

An important feature of the jacket is the large interior flat surfaces that conform to and contact the exterior surfaces of the insulators . In addition the jacket must remain in intimate contact with the rails . In contact between the rails and the jacket is between the exterior curved surfaces of the rails and the interior curved surfaces of the jacket that conform to and contact the curved surfaces . There is a thin non conductive layer not shown at the interface between the jacket and the insulators and the rails i.e. surfaces . The thin non conductive layer functions as a barrier to prevent an electrical circuit from forming between the rails and the jacket.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
