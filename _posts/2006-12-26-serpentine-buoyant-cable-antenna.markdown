The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The instant application is related to three co pending U.S. Patent Applications entitled BUOYANT CABLE ANTENNA SYSTEM AND METHOD WITH ARTIULATING BLOCKS Navy Case No. 80224 BUOYANT CABLE ANTENNA CONFIGURATION AND SYSTEM Navy Case No. 80225 BUOYANT CABLE ANTENNA SYSTEM Navy Case No. 8.0227 having the same filing date.

The present invention relates to an improved buoyant cable antenna for marine applications and a process of manufacturing same.

Buoyant cable arrangements have been used in a number of marine applications. For example buoyant cables have been used in the seismic surveying of underwater geological formations. U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 570 707 to Parr and 2 638 176 to Doolittle illustrate two such buoyant cable arrangements. In the Parr system the cable is constructed and arranged to float one the water surface either by virtue of its own buoyancy or by the use of buoyant devices secured thereto. The cable in a preferred embodiment was a metal cable such as a stainless steel cable to which were secured cork floats. In Doolittle the cable is supported by a plurality of floats.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 287 691 to Savit illustrates a deployed hydrophone cable. The cable comprises a plurality of hydrophones connected to the cable in spaced relationship along its length and floatable cable covering segments having a positive buoyancy encasing the cable between the hydrophones. The hydrophone cable itself comprises a conventional multi conductor insulated cable.

Buoyant cable antenna systems are known in the prior art. illustrates one such buoyant cable antenna system which is deployed from a submerged vehicle . The system includes a buoyant cable transmission line to which is connected in sequence a loop amplifier an athwart loop antenna a wire amplifier and a horizontal antenna element .

On going buoyant cable antenna research requires the use of a flexible buoyant material that when deployed by a marine vehicle such as a submerged vehicle realizes a designed shape.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved buoyant cable antenna system.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a buoyant cable antenna system as above utilizing a serpentine shape and a keel portion.

It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a process for manufacturing a buoyant cable antenna system.

In accordance with the present invention a buoyant cable antenna system is provided. The buoyant cable antenna system broadly comprises a buoyant cable transmission line segment and an antenna segment formed from a flexible memory structure of coil compression spring encapsulated in a buoyant molding material attached to an end of the buoyant cable transmission line segment. The flexible memory material forming the antenna segment is capable of assuming a designed shape and recover after being straightened and flexed.

The buoyant cable antenna system may be manufactured using a process comprising the steps of creating an antenna segment by providing at least one compression spring having a plurality of coils pinching the coils of the at least one compression spring to impart a desired shape to the at least one compression spring and encapsulating the at least one compression spring within a buoyant flexible encapsulation material. The process further comprises joining the antenna segment to a buoyant cable transmission line segment.

Other details of the buoyant cable antenna system of the present invention and the process for manufacturing same as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.

Referring now to a buoyant cable antenna system in accordance with the present invention may be deployed from a submerged marine vehicle . The buoyant cable antenna system includes a buoyant cable transmission line segment and an antenna segment attached to an end of the buoyant cable transmission line segment by a joint . The buoyant cable transmission line segment may comprise any suitable buoyant cable transmission line known in the art.

The antenna segment may have a variety of sections having different shapes preferably all formed from a flexible memory material. For example the antenna segment may include a U shaped keel portion to counterbalance vertical element . Following the keel portion the antenna segment may include a horizontal serpentine shaped section . The section in a preferred embodiment floats on the water surface. Still further the antenna segment may include a vertical element . Element is a fractional wavelength rigid linear conductor suitably moisture proofed by a casing. A conventional microwave coaxial transmission line not shown extends through the one or more helical springs and the linear conductor element is suitably connected by a coupling arrangement not shown with the transmission line.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the joint the keel portion the horizontal serpentine shaped section and the curved portion of vertical antenna element are each formed from an encapsulated compression helical spring coil structure. Any suitable technique known in the art may be used to form the portion the section and the vertical element from a suitable flexible memory material. The serpentine section which includes buoyant encapsulant imparts forces maintaining section vertical.

In a preferred technique each of the aforementioned antenna sections except segment which is rigid linear antenna elements is formed from one or more compression springs . When a coil of a compression spring is pinched into a curved shape with a consecutive coil in a given area the compression spring will start to assume a curved shape. By pinching a plurality of coils along the length of the compression spring the compression spring will assume a particular curved shape. Thus a compression spring can be pinched to form the shape of the U shaped keel portion . If desired a separate compression spring or the same compression spring could be pinched to form the horizontal serpentine shaped portion . Further the coupling at the lower end of vertical element can be formed from the same compression spring or yet another compression spring permitting bending for storage in linear relation thereto. Once the compression spring or springs have been shaped it is or they are laid in a mold . The mold is then filled with an encapsulating material that encapsulates the spring s and retains the desired spring shape. One suitable material which provides buoyancy is the microballoon loaded polymer disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 606 329 entitled Buoyant Cable Antenna hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The result is a flexible construction which has a shape memory so that it returns to the encapsulated shape even after being straightened and or flexed. The encapsulating material in addition to insuring that the desired shape will be retained provides increased mechanical rigidity to the encapsulated spring . Springs of any spring constant can be used to provide an end desired material spring constant. After the antenna segment is formed it may be joined in any suitable manner to the buoyant cable transmission line using any suitable means known in the art such as joint .

By providing an antenna segment having a vertical element which extends above the water surface one can extend the frequency range of the antenna.

While the antenna system of the present invention has been illustrated as being deployed from a submerged vehicle such a submarine it may be deployed from any suitable marine vehicle.

It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a serpentine buoyant cable antenna which fully satisfies the objects means and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof other alternatives modifications and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Therefore it is intended to embrace those alternatives modifications and variations which fall within the broad scope of the appended claims.
