title: Linear actuator for flapping hydrofoil
abstract: A linear actuator is provided that converts linear motion to oscillatory motion. The linear actuator includes flats, a hinge, and linear actuators. A hydrofoil is mountable on a spindle attached to the hinge. In operation, a linear push direction by the linear actuator drive causes the hydrofoil to rotate in an oscillating manner. A linear push by another linear actuator drive reverses the oscillation directions of the hydrofoil. The flats are preferably made of flexible strip metal to easily transmit motion to the spindle. The hydrofoil and spindle combine to a slot for smooth transmission of linear to oscillatory motion.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates to propulsors specifically to a linear actuator that produces oscillatory motion. The oscillatory motion is employed by flapping hydrofoils used in propulsors for undersea vehicles.

It is known in the art that there are significant differences between heaving pitching foil propulsion and conventional propulsion. The design of current underwater propulsors is based on steady state hydrodynamic and aerodynamic theories as well as experimental knowledge. This is true of aircraft and undersea vehicles with this branch of engineering reaching a high level of maturity.

Further improvement in conventional propulsion will be incremental if the basic mechanism of production of lift on a hydrofoil remains largely the same. Conversely if new and powerful mechanisms of lift production can be found and computational methods of hydrofoil blade design for implementing those mechanisms can be developed new material technologies control theories and information processing architecture can be implemented.

For heaving pitching foil propulsion a flapping hydrofoil is used. In operation the hydrofoil moves about an axis transverse to the direction of vehicle movement as does a rudder but the hydrofoil oscillates so as to generate vortices about axes transverse to this direction. A single hydrofoil may be used or a plurality of hydrofoils variously moving toward or from each other may be used. The hydrofoil movements and phases of multiple hydrofoils may be variously intermittent may be altered in frequency and amplitude or may be asymmetric. These variations are advantageously selected for conditions when wake detection or reduction is not important when a vehicle speed changes or when the vehicle maneuvers.

Based on neural mechanics a significant improvement in the development of quieter heaving pitching propulsors is likely. Research into biology rather than physics indicates the feasibility that complex active systems can indeed be miniaturized and can be functional competitive.

Based on steady state hydrodynamics and aerodynamics flying insects like fruit flies are not supposed to fly yet the insects do. It has been shown using scaled up models of flying insects like fruit flies that the fruit flies possess three mechanisms of lift enhancement. These lift mechanisms are based on unsteady hydrodynamics and not steady state hydrodynamics.

First the lift mechanisms produce vortices at the leading and trailing edges of the wings of the fruit flies. This dynamic stall delays conventional stall and allows higher levels of lift forces to be produced. Second a rotational effect occurs due to wing rotation. It has also been shown that efficiency is highest and maximum lift is produced when the center of rotation is at about the quarter chord point from the leading edge. The third lift mechanism is wake or vortex capture.

As such an improvement to propulsion would be to help apply the effects of the lift mechanisms one or two or all three of the effects. The improved mechanisms could be used with undersea vehicles to enhance the lift produced by propulsion blades and the rotational speed RPM revolutions per minute can thus be reduced.

As is also known in the art there are three sources of propulsion radiated noise coming from a rotor blade. The first source of propulsion radiated noise is due to the ingestion of upstream vehicle turbulence by the rotor blade. The second source of propulsion radiated noise is blade tonals due to the gust created by a rotor blade shearing through the wake of the upstream stator blade. The third source of propulsion radiated noise is trailing edge vibration.

These three sources of propulsion radiated noise are proportional to the 4 5and 6power of RPM. When the RPM is reduced the noise due to all these three sources are reduced. In heaving and pitching propulsion frequencies are 1 100or even less than those in conventional propulsors.

As such an improvement in decreasing radiated noise would be to go further than simply applying a heaving and pitching mechanism. One such improvement would be implementing the heaving and pitching mechanism in an even quieter manner by the use of an improved actuator.

Presently the oscillatory motion of actuators is produced by servo gear drives which tend to have a modest efficiency. Thus there is also a need for more efficient mechanisms for producing oscillatory motions in hydrofoils. More importantly even apart from efficiency servo gear drives produce noise and vibration in the hull which in turn radiates noise. As such there is a need to lower such drive noise and vibration.

Accordingly it is a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide a device that converts linear motion to oscillatory motion.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a device that produces oscillatory motion for flapping hydrofoils.

It is further object of the present invention to provide a device that produces oscillatory motion in a quiet manner.

In order to attain the objects described there is provided a linear actuator of the present invention. The linear actuator generally includes flats a hinge and linear drives. A hydrofoil is mounted on a spindle attached to the hinge. In operation a linear push direction by the linear actuator drive causes the hydrofoil to rotate in an oscillating manner. A linear push by another linear actuator drive reverses the oscillation directions of the hydrofoil. The flats are preferably made of flexible strip metal to easily transmit motion to the spindle. The hydrofoil and spindle combine to a slot for smooth transmission of linear to oscillatory motion. The linear actuator lowers radiated noise of undersea vehicles due the elimination of servos with gear drives for producing heaving and pitching motion. Also the linear actuator has the potential to be free of backlash common in gear drives due to wear and tear of the gear drives in use.

Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout the several views one sees that schematically depicts a linear actuator of the present invention.

Construction of the linear actuator is shown in and . In the figures the flats and merge into and mechanically attach to a divider block before the hinge where the spindle is centrally positioned. The flats and are preferably made of flexible strip metal to easily transmit motion to the spindle however other flexible materials known to those skilled in the art may be used. A similar block from the spindle meets the block and at the merging point there is a slot to allow unobstructed motion transmission between the linkages of the blocks.

The linear actuator of the present invention lowers radiated noise of undersea vehicles due the elimination of servos with gear drives for producing heaving and pitching motion. Also the linear actuator has the potential to be free of backlash common in gear drives due to wear and tear of the gear drives in use.

Furthermore the linear actuator has the potential to be lighter and free of mechanical mechanisms by the use of artificial muscles and electrically operated by the use of electrodes and operationally similar electro active polymers.

Still further the linear actuator has the potential to utilize linear electromechanical drives which have less mechanical friction compared to gear drives that motors and servos utilize.
