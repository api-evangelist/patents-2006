title: Determining a user's groups
abstract: The present invention is directed to technology for determining the set of groups of which a user is a member. A user can be a static member, dynamic member or nested member of a group. A user is a nested member of a first group if that user is a member of a second group and the second group is a member of the first group. There can be multiple levels of nesting. For example, an entity can be a nested member of a first group if that entity is a member of a second group, which is a member of a third group, which is a member of a fourth group, which is a member of the first group. The present invention can determine the groups of which the user is a static member, dynamic member or nested member.
