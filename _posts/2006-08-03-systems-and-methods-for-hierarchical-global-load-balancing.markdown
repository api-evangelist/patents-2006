The present invention generally relates to data communication networks. In particular the present invention relates to systems and methods for providing aggregator appliances for global and hierarchical load balancing of branch offices.

A corporate or enterprise network may service many branch offices. Each branch office may have its own network servers and resources. An appliance may be deployed at a branch office to provide gateway services locally to the client or servers located at the branch office. In the corporate wide network branch office appliances may be deployed at each of the branch offices. Many resources such as servers applications data files may be deployed across these branch offices. Additionally a branch office may have under utilized resources and available computing time.

At any of the branch offices there may be resources that could be available or useful to access by users or computing devices at other branch offices. For example a client of a first branch office may want to access a resource such as an application on a server at a second branch office. In some cases the client of the first branch office is not aware of the existence or availability of resources at the second branch office. In other cases resources at branch offices lay idle as they are not easily available to users across the corporate network. This results in inefficient use of the corporate network and deployed resource. In order to avail a client of a branch office access to resources from another branch office an administrator may need to manually and specifically configure the gateway or branch office appliance to know of the other appliances in the network. With resources deployed across many branch offices each of the branch office appliances may need to be manually configured to know of the other branch office appliances. This leads to significant amount of time and costs in configuring and maintaining multiple branch office appliances or gateway.

It would therefore be desirable to provide systems and methods to reduce branch office configuration while load balancing resources globally across the enterprise and branch offices.

The present invention is directed towards an aggregator appliance that provides aggregation and load balancing of branch office appliances in a hierarchical fashion and a manner that reduces configuration of the branch office appliance. Any of the branch office appliances may be configured to know of or identify a single aggregator appliance . For example a first branch office appliance may be configured to identify and connect to the first aggregator appliance. The first branch office appliance may not be configured to have any information and therefore may not know of the second aggregator appliance or any branch office appliances connected to the second aggregator appliance. In this manner the configuration of branch office appliance is reduced. Even though the configuration is reduced a branch office appliance servicing a request may access any of the other appliances known to an aggregator appliance. Since the aggregator appliances share information on branch office appliance a first aggregator appliance can identify to a first branch office appliance information identifying any of the branch office appliances connected via any of the aggregator appliances. In this way resource requests can be load balanced globally across all branch offices and branch office appliances.

In one aspect the present invention is related to a method for providing a hierarchy of appliances to more efficiently access resources across a plurality of branch offices. The method includes the steps of establishing by a first aggregator appliance connections with a first plurality of branch office appliances and establishing by a second aggregator appliance connections with a second plurality of branch office appliances.

The method includes receiving by the first aggregator appliance from a first branch office appliance of the first plurality of branch office a request from a client for access to a resource. The first aggregator appliance identifies via the second aggregator appliance a second branch office appliance from the second plurality of branch office appliances to service the request. The first aggregator appliance transmits to one of the client or a first branch office appliance information identifying the second branch office appliance. The method includes the client establishing a connection with the second branch office appliance.
