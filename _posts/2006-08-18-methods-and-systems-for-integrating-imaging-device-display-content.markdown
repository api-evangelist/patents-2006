This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 233 270 entitled Methods and Systems for Imaging Device Display Standardization filed on Sep. 22 2005 which is a continuation in part of 

Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for integrating imaging device display content.

Imaging devices such as printers copiers scanners and fax machines can have a wide array of functions and capabilities to fit specific uses or combinations of uses. Imaging devices often take the form of a multi function peripheral device MFP that combines the functions of two or more of the traditionally separated imaging devices. An MFP may combine any number of imaging devices but typically comprises the functions of a printer scanner copier and fax machine.

Some imaging devices may contain computing resources for data storage and processing such as processors hard disk drives memory and other devices. As imaging devices add more features and functions they become more costly and complex.

More complex imaging devices and MFPs may comprise network connectivity to provide communication with other computing devices such as personal computers other imaging devices network servers and other apparatus. This connectivity allows the imaging device to utilize off board resources that are available on a connected network.

Imaging devices typically have a user input panel with an array of buttons knobs and other user input devices. Some devices also have a display panel which can be for display only or can be a touch panel display that enables user input directly on the display.

Devices with touch panel displays or displays with buttons arranged in cooperation with the display can display menu data that may be selected by user input. This menu data is typically driven by an on board server module within the imaging device.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise systems methods and devices for interacting with a remote computing device from an imaging device. These embodiments comprise remote computing devices configured to communicate with imaging devices imaging devices configured to communicate with remote computing devices and systems comprising various combinations of remote computing devices in communication with imaging devices.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for imaging device display standardization.

The foregoing and other objectives features and advantages of the invention will be more readily understood upon consideration of the following detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the present invention will be best understood by reference to the drawings wherein like parts are designated by like numerals throughout. The figures listed above are expressly incorporated as part of this detailed description.

It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein could be arranged and designed in a wide variety of different configurations. Thus the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the methods and systems of the present invention is not intended to limit the scope of the invention but it is merely representative of the presently preferred embodiments of the invention.

Elements of embodiments of the present invention may be embodied in hardware firmware and or software. While exemplary embodiments revealed herein may only describe one of these forms it is to be understood that one skilled in the art would be able to effectuate these elements in any of these forms while resting within the scope of the present invention.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise interfaces and architecture that integrate imaging devices with remote computing device applications and environments to provide solutions that may not be possible solely with an imaging device alone. Some embodiments comprise an infrastructure and set of interfaces that allow applications on a network to programmatically control imaging device functions and interact with a user through an imaging device input panel. Software functions that are not practical within the imaging device can be performed on the server but are accessible from the imaging device.

For the purposes of this specification and claims an imaging device IDev may be described as a device that performs an imaging function. Imaging functions comprise scanning printing copying image transmission sending and receiving image conversion and other functions. Exemplary imaging devices comprise printers copiers facsimile machines scanners computing devices that transmit convert or process images and other devices. An IDev may also perform multiple imaging functions. For example and not by way of limitation a multi function peripheral device MFP which typically has the capability to perform a plurality of functions comprising a printer scanner copier and or a facsimile machine or image transmitter receiver is a type of imaging device. Other MFP imaging devices may comprise other combinations of functions and still qualify as an IDev.

For the purposes of this specification and claims a remote computing device RCD is a device capable of processing data and communicating with other devices through a communications link. An RCD is a remote device because it requires a communications link such as a network connection a telephone line a serial cable or some other wired or wireless link to communicate with other devices such as an imaging device. Some exemplary RCDs are network servers networked computers and other processing and storage devices that have communications links.

Some embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to . These embodiments comprise an imaging device IDev that may be a multi function peripheral device MFP or a single function device. The imaging device further comprises a user interface UI panel which may comprise input buttons and a display device or may comprise a touch panel system with or without buttons . User input and display may also be performed through a separate UI device which may be connected to the imaging device by a communication link such as a USB connection a network cable a wireless connection or some other communications link. UI device may comprise an input device such as a keyboard or buttons as well as a display device which may also be a touch screen panel. UI device may also comprise an interface for transfer of instructions that are input to the device from a remote input device. This form of UI device may comprise memory sticks USB memory cards and other storage devices that may be configured to store input for transfer to an imaging device.

These embodiments further comprise a remote computing device RCD that is linked to the imaging device via a communications link such as a network connection. This network connection may be a typical wired connection or a wireless link.

Embodiments of the present invention may provide menu data from the RCD to the imaging device UI panel or remote panel via the network connection . Once this menu data is fed to the imaging device an UI panel on the imaging device may be used to interact with applications that run on the remote computing device . User input received from UI panels may be returned directly to the remote computing device .

A Web Service is a software application identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier URI whose interfaces and binding are capable of being defined described and discovered by Extensible Markup Language XML artifacts and supports direct interactions with other software applications using XML based messages via Internet based protocols.

An application on the remote computing device may use one or more Web Services to control various features in the imaging device such as enabling disabling or setting device values or controlling device functions.

Embodiments of the present invention allow network applications running on remote computing devices to interact with the user of the imaging device through the imaging device I O panel. These embodiments allow imaging device user interface Ul control i.e. touch panel button display by applications. Some embodiments may also integrate custom display screens or menus with the native imaging device UI. Embodiments may hand off control of imaging device functions between standard operation modes performed on the imaging device in response to user input to an imaging device UI and open systems modes that utilize network resources such as applications on RCDs through user input at the imaging device UI.

Embodiments of the present invention comprise network based applications that have full control over the imaging device UI to display text and graphics in any format. In these embodiments the application can programmatically display buttons textboxes graphics etc. in any layout desired.

In some embodiments the UI layout is easy to program using a standard language such as a markup language. These languages comprise Hypertext Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML Wireless Markup Language WML Extensible Hypertext Markup Language XHTML and other languages.

In some embodiments of the present invention a remote computing device application or server application is able to request a keyboard UI to be displayed on the imaging device display . In some embodiments this functionality is available on the imaging device and does not need to be recreated by remote computing device applications. In some embodiments the remote computing device may define the keyboard prompt and default values. These embodiments may comprise a remote computing device that is able to rename imaging device UI buttons such as the OK and Cancel buttons as well as define additional buttons.

In some embodiments menu templates may be served to the imaging device UI by the imaging device itself or from a remote computing device .

Some embodiments of the present invention may comprise a remote computing device application that is registered as the External Authorization server. The External Authorization application may control access to the imaging device and may have top level control of the UI. UI control may be given to this application in the same manner that control is given to an internal auditor.

In these embodiments when an imaging device system boots it checks to see if an External Authorization application is registered. If so the imaging device is placed in disabled mode and the application is contacted to take control of the UI. If the External Authorization server is not available an error message may be displayed and the device may remain disabled. The imaging device may periodically try to contact the External Authorization server until it is available. Table 1 below describes what entity has control of the UI in an exemplary embodiment when the device is in a disabled state.

In embodiments of the present invention access to the custom UI panels of imaging devices may vary from application to application. Some solutions such as Document Management integration may wish to leverage the native Image Send screens but display some custom UI s to gather additional information about a scan job. Other solutions like custom printing applications may be accessed from a separate mode than the native functions.

In order to accommodate the diversified needs of these solutions applications embodiments may support multiple integration points for UI control. These integration points are based on a user action trigger for which applications may register. In some embodiments applications may be registered with target devices so that the device knows that when trigger A occurs on the front panel to contact remote computing device B for instructions. In exemplary embodiments applications may be integrated with an imaging device at any of several trigger points.

Remote computing devices may be registered to a specific function and contacted when that function s hardware key is pressed e.g. Image Send on the imaging device UI. Any UI information provided by the remote computing device may be displayed instead of the standard function screens native to the imaging device. This trigger may be used for applications that wish to replace the existing functions with completely custom UI s such as an alternative scan solution or a specialized display such as a Section 508 compatible screen or other specialized need interface that may have large buttons or other accommodations.

In some embodiments each function on the imaging device may have a menu on the touch screen that remote computing devices such as servers can register. This enables solutions applications to provide custom content and still use some of the standard functionality provided by the imaging device. When a button assigned to a custom application is selected a menu will be displayed with the solutions registered to that function. Users may select the desired solution and the remote computing device will be contacted for instructions.

In some embodiments a stand alone RCD mode that provides remote computing device application access can be accessed from the job queue portion of the UI that is displayed on every screen. This trigger point may be used for applications that do not fit within one of the standard device functions such as custom printing solutions on an imaging device. When the RCD menu is selected a menu will be displayed with the solutions applications registered to the generic RCD mode. Users will select the desired solution and the remote computing device will be contacted for instructions.

In some embodiments of the present invention when an imaging device is enabled additional hardware keys may be used to manage the device. Hardware key assignments for an exemplary embodiment are shown in table 2.

In some embodiments in addition to the key for logout a timeout period may be implemented. Some embodiments also comprise an auto clear setting that can be configured for a given period of time such as 10 to 240 seconds or disabled . In these embodiments when there is no activity for the time configured in auto clear the device may automatically return to disabled mode and attempt to contact a remote computing device to retake control of the UI.

Depending on a particular solution a remote computing device application may have full or only partial control of the imaging device UI and a particular imaging job. In some embodiments partial control may include cases where a remote computing device is monitoring clicks but native modes are responsible for the UI interaction and controlling the job. Partial control may also include cases where the remote computing device application is integrated with a native mode UI trigger function custom menu . In these embodiments the imaging device may handle all error and jam notifications with only a notification sent to the relevant remote computing device application.

For some embodiments in cases where the remote computing device application has full control over the UI and the job error and jam notifications may be handled differently depending on the type of error. For recoverable errors a notification may be sent to the remote computing device application and the application may be responsible for displaying messages and resolving the error. For non recoverable errors the imaging device and RCD mode may interact to gracefully handle the error condition e.g. provide user with instructions for clearing jam .

In some embodiments at different points throughout an imaging job several applications may need control over an imaging device including but not limited to an External Authorization application a standard RCD application an imaging device native mode and other applications. The following section describes for an exemplary embodiment the various steps in an exemplary job the entities that may have control during each step and what type of control may be allowed.

Step 1 User provides credentials to access the device at the device UI. This step may be controlled by a remote computing device such as an External Authorization application or by Internal Accounting native mode in the imaging device itself. At the end of this step the device is enabled. The External Authorization application may also specify default parameters or disable specific job parameters e.g. default file format is PDF but user may change color mode is set to B W and user may not change .

Step 2 User sets parameters for the job using one of the native imaging device modes or a standard RCD application. At the end of this step the user makes an input to initiate the job. When the input is made an optional notification may be sent to the standard RCD application which can then change job parameters if desired. An e mail application is one example of an application that may request notification when the user input is made. A user may use native Image Send screens or other input to select scan options and choose e mail recipients. A user may then select a custom application button and choose the scan to e mail option from the menu. The e mail application may then display custom screens for the user to set permissions for the file. Once a user places the original document s on the scanner and initiates the process the e mail application may capture the destination parameters set by the user and change the target destination to the e mail application FTP server. The e mail application may then receive the file apply the appropriate permissions and send to the e mail recipients selected by the user. A remote computing device application may also want to retake control of the UI at this point if as in some embodiments the application generates thumbnails of the scanned images and displays them to the user for verification.

Step 3 Once the job is initiated the imaging device is responsible for scanning or RIPing the job and spooling it to the HDD. If the imaging device is configured to authorize jobs with an external authorization application it may send a click report to the application and wait for instructions. The external authorization application may enable the job for sending printing cancel the job or change job parameters and then enable . As an example a rules based printing application may wish to change job parameters after it receives a click report. Some rules based printing applications support rules based printing and scanning that can limit what each user is allowed to do based on the time of day the destination or many other parameters. For example only users in the marketing group may be able to scan high quality color images. If a user from another group selects color and 600 dpi a rules based application may change the parameters to color and 200 dpi. At the end of this step the job should either be authorized or canceled.

Step 4 In some embodiments this may be an optional step where the standard RCD application in step 2 may have specified the destination as a HDD for temporary storage. This step may also be used in some embodiments by a Java application running on the imaging device. For example a government office may have a custom encryption application running on the device that takes the scanned document encrypts it and then requests the imaging device to send it to the target destination selected by the user in step 2. In some embodiments it may be beneficial to send a notification to the external authorization application after this step because the imaging device does not know how long the file will be on the HDD or what the application is going to do with it and after the send print step.

Step 5 In the final step the file is actually output. In typical embodiments the file is either sent over the network or printed locally. At the end of this step a notification that the job was successfully completed should be sent to the external authorization application and optionally to the standard RCD application.

The API s may be used to allow a remote computing device application to control access to an imaging device for vend applications and to manage the device from a remote location.

In some embodiments of the present invention a Device Control and Vend API allows applications to enable and disable access to the device and track click counts. The Device Control and Vend API may provide an RCD with the following controls 

Enable disable device of function this may allow an RCD to enable or disable access to the device as a whole or by function to enforce individual user privileges. In some exemplary embodiments the functions listed in Table 3 may be selectively enabled or disabled by an application.

Report clicks used at the end of a successful job the clicks used may be reported back to an RCD including 

Debit mode in these embodiments when an application enables the device it may specify if the current job requires authorization. If so the job will be spooled to memory and click information e.g. as defined in Table 4 will be sent to an RCD. An RCD will then notify the device if the job should be deleted or output sent. At this point the application also has the option of changing job parameters. If the application does not require authorization the job will continue as normal and a click report will be sent at the end of the job.

Print job accounting in these embodiments an RCD may wish to monitor print jobs along with walk up functions. For print job accounting an IDev may monitor all incoming print jobs and send accounting data in the PJL header to an RCD for verification before printing the job. The RCD will evaluate the accounting data or lack thereof and inform the IDev to continue with or cancel the job.

Report on unidentified jobs in these embodiments an RCD may also wish to monitor print jobs that it cannot associate to a specific user such as device reports and incoming fax jobs. The RCD can register to receive click counts for all unidentified jobs so that it may bill them to a general account.

In some embodiments of the present invention a Device Management API allows a network application to remotely setup and manage the imaging device. In exemplary embodiments the Device Management API may provide an RCD with the following controls 

The above groupings are provided only as an exemplary embodiment detailing which settings should be included. In some embodiments actual API s should be grouped by functional areas since there may be overlap between Key Operator settings and web page settings.

In some embodiments an Internal Accounting API may allow a remote computing device application to configure internal accounting and report click counts. In some exemplary embodiments an Internal Accounting API may include 

Some embodiments of the present invention may comprise a Font and Form Management API which allows an RCD application to remotely download and manage fonts and forms in mass storage. In some exemplary embodiments a Font and Form Management API may provide a remote computing device with the following controls 

In some embodiments of the present invention a Firmware Management API may allow a remote computing device or network application to remotely download and manage the imaging device firmware. In some exemplary embodiments a Firmware Management API may provide a remote computing device e.g. a server with the following controls 

In some embodiments of the present invention device function API s allow a remote computing device application to use existing imaging device functionality to provide new custom solutions.

In some embodiments an Image Send API may provide the remote computing device application with the following controls 

In some embodiments a remote computing device can change the default values on the imaging device or the values for the current job. For the current job the remote computing device may also specify if scan parameters may be modified by the user or not. If one remote computing device application e.g. Access Control specifies that a parameter cannot be changed and then a second application e.g. Document Management tries to set the parameter a notification may be sent to the second application and the setting will not be changed.

In some embodiments print jobs may be submitted by remote computing device applications using standard printing channels. In some exemplary embodiments a Print API may provide a remote computing device with the following additional control 

In some embodiments of the present invention a Copy API may provide a remote computing device with the following exemplary controls 

In some embodiments a remote computing device can change the default values on the imaging device or the values for the current job. For the current job the remote computing device may also specify if copy parameters may be modified by the user or not.

In some embodiments of the present invention a Document Filing API may provide a remote computing device with the following exemplary controls 

Allowing external applications to control an imaging device opens up the imaging device to new security vulnerabilities. In embodiments of the present invention that provide some security measures the following exemplary items are security concerns that may be addressed by the remote computing device interface.

Access to remote computing device interfaces may be limited to valid applications. Embodiments provide extensive access and control of the imaging device which poses a significant security risk. The interface of these embodiments may be protected from access by attackers while maintaining ease of setup and use for valid solutions.

Confidential data user credentials and job data may be protected during network transfer. User credentials and job data may be secured during network transfer to ensure that it cannot be stolen an intruder cannot monitor device activity and a man in the middle attack cannot change messages. Imaging devices may support Secure Sockets Layer SSL and other connections to ensure data is safe while being communicated between the imaging device and remote computing device applications.

Administrators may have the ability to lock down imaging device access. For users with strict security policies administrators may have the ability to disable access by remote computing devices or limit access to specific applications. Administrators may have an option to register the limited applications that they wish to access the imaging device interfaces.

Remote computing device applications may ensure the imaging device is not being spoofed. The remote computing device may be able to authenticate an imaging device that it is contract with it to ensure an intruder cannot imitate the imaging device to collect network configuration and password information monitor file folder structures of a document management system or spoof security settings and DSK status of the imaging device.

A remote computing device may ensure that the server is not being spoofed. The imaging device must be able to authenticate all remote computing devices that it is in contact with to ensure that an intruder is not spoofing the remote computing device s IP address. By pretending to be the remote computing device an intruder could steal user credentials redirect scanned documents change device settings or firmware or bring down the access control system either to provide access to unauthorized users or initiate a denial of service attack for valid users .

Access control vend applications may not be compromised when a remote computing device is unavailable. When the remote computing device is unavailable it may not be acceptable to provide open access to the device. If the remote computing device is unavailable at startup or becomes unavailable at anytime e.g. someone disconnects network cable the imaging device may immediately be disabled and an error message displayed.

An administrator may be able to adjust a security level based on company and application requirements. Security requirements can have a large impact on the time it takes to develop a remote computing device application and the resources required to implement the solution. Users using some embodiments may range from a small business with one imaging device no IT staff and a simple scan or print application to a large government office using access control and audit trails to track all device activity. The security measures used to protect imaging device interfaces may be adjustable by the administrator to match the target environment.

The imaging device and remote computing device applications may be able to hand off user credentials. Users may be prompted to login at multiple points throughout a job. For example an access control application or accounting application may control total device access the imaging device may have user authentication enabled for Image Send and a document management application may require user login before showing a folder list. In many environments all of these applications will use a common user database. In some embodiments it is therefore desirable for the applications to pass user credentials to each other so that each one does not have to repeat the authentication process.

In these embodiments menu data may be sent through a communications link to an imaging device . Accordingly menu data configured for display on an imaging device is stored on RCD .

An RCD of some embodiments will be further configured to receive user input obtained through the user interface of an imaging device and transferred to the RCD over communications links . Once this input data is received at an RCD the input data may be processed . This processing may comprise conversion of the data to a new format execution of commands contained within the data or some other process. Once the input data has been processed the processed output may be sent back to the imaging device where the processed output may be used in an imaging device process or function.

In some embodiments as described with reference to an RCD may send menu data configured for an imaging device display using a markup language. The markup language menu data is then received at the imaging device and displayed to a user. Typically this will prompt the user to enter an input on the imaging device user interface .

In these embodiments a single RCD may be used to provide processing power resources and functionality to a plurality of imaging devices without reproducing these resources in each imaging device. In some embodiments data generated by input on one imaging device may be directed to another imaging device for processed data output or final processing.

Some embodiments of the present invention may be described with reference to . In these embodiments an imaging device IDev comprises a user interface which is capable of receiving user input and displaying data to a user.

In some embodiments an RCD or database may be connected to an IDev over a wide area network such as the internet .

Some embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for functionality standardization with imaging device IDev display customization. The look and feel of an IDev operation panel display is a constituent part of the IDev from both the operational and marketing perspective. Applications developed on a remote computing device RCD intended to run on a multiplicity of IDevs while requiring the same operational function on each of the variety of IDevs benefit by retaining the look and feel customary to each particular IDev. It is undesirable that application developers require a priori knowledge and understanding of the layout and display attributes distinctive to a target IDev. In exemplary embodiments of the present invention an application developer may write a single application that will retain functionality on a multiplicity of IDevs while reflecting the look and feel of individual IDevs.

Some embodiments of the present invention achieve the above by separation of layout and format information IDev dependent information from function and operation information IDev independent information. The application running on the RCD communicates display data formatted to a predefined syntactic profile that the IDev integrates into a form that defines the look and feel of the IDev. The composition of control buttons content area and an optional paging area for navigation between multiple pages of content may comprise a form matched to a syntactic profile to which display data may be formatted. The IDev display information is formed by combining the function information provided by the application the IDev independent information with the layout and look and feel the IDev dependent information into the integrated page. Exemplary embodiments described herein may comprise various control elements such as control buttons checkboxes check buttons radio buttons soft keys hard keys pointer operated controls and others known in the art. These control elements are merely exemplary and the present invention does not rely on a particular control element.

Some embodiments of the present invention comprise methods and systems for imaging device IDev display standardization that allow imaging devices with diverse operation panel display characteristics and user input device capabilities to display standardized application user interface screens. In some exemplary embodiments of the present invention an application developer may write a single application that may be used by a user at an IDev equipped with a physical keyboard peripheral and a UI display capable of displaying only three lines of text. Another user at a different IDev that is not equipped with a physical keyboard and which has a larger UI display capable of displaying a soft keyboard along with more lines of text may access the same application and view the same UI screens as the first user without the need of writing multiple versions of the application customized for every IDev UI display possibility.

Some embodiments of the present invention may comprise imaging devices IDevs equipped with embedded forms which may comprise formatting instructions specific to that IDev s operation panel display and input capabilities. These stored forms may be integrated with UI data received from remote applications to form a standardized page specifically formatted to be displayed on that IDev s UI display. In some exemplary embodiments a form may comprise an XHTML form class that may provide buttons titles and layout information for various application UI screens such as login and menus.

Some embodiments of the present invention may comprise applications written to operate in conjunction with IDev format forms. These applications may generate application specific template field data ASTFD and a form ID which may be sent to an IDev when requested. The IDev may then use the form ID from the application to identify the corresponding format form stored on the IDev and may then integrate the format form with the ASTFD to form a customized application screen for that IDev s UI display. In some exemplary embodiments a form ID may comprise an XHTML form class reference that may specify the type of form to be used for that particular data.

In further embodiments of the present invention a Template Server Application TSA may be used to manage the ASTFD and form IDs for multiple applications. In some embodiments when an application request is received from an IDev the TSA may match the application selection with the corresponding ASTFD and form ID and send the ASTFD and form ID back to the IDev. The TSA may work in conjunction with one or more other applications to format data and interface with an IDev.

Some embodiments of the present invention may comprise a stand alone imaging device IDev with internal processing capabilities. Other embodiments may comprise an imaging device IDev in communication with one or more remote computing devices RCDs .

In an exemplary embodiment illustrated in an imaging device IDev application login method may request input of a text string such as a name and a password at a UI for access to the application. How this input is accomplished may vary from one imaging device to another depending on size and input capability constraints imposed upon a specific IDev UI and its display. In some embodiments of the present invention an IDev UI display may only be able to display 3 lines of text and may have a physical keyboard attached via USB or some other method for user input of text.

Other IDev UI displays may have larger display capacity but may not have a physical keyboard attached for data input. These embodiments may have a soft keyboard which may be accessed at the UI display. In these embodiments the IDev UI display menus may comprise both a text field and a button field for the soft keyboard or may alternate between the two fields depending on user input.

Other imaging devices may allow an application menu screen on an IDev UI display to show a text field and soft keyboard displayed simultaneously. The IDev application may provide the same template field data and form ID to every IDev that requests the application. The requesting IDev may match the field data and form ID provided by the application to a corresponding form stored on the IDev. The stored form may provide the necessary formatting information required to display the data correctly on that specific IDev UI display.
