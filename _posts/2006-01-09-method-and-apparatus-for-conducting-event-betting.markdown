This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 642 613 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONDUCTING EVENT BETTING filed on Jan. 10 2005. This application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The field of the invention relates generally to sports and event betting and more specifically to the use of the Internet in land based casino sports and event betting.

Betting on sports and other events is a multi billion dollar business for casinos and the Internet around the world. Land based casinos have large sports and event betting parlors for attracting bettors. These parlors display the bets that a person may make on various sporting or types of events. Bets are placed on most major sports including professional and college football soccer baseball basketball auto racing and ice hockey as well as cricket rugby. Further bets are placed on various sports tournaments including the NCAA Men s and Women s Basketball Championships and World Cup Soccer. Also bets may be placed on other types of events including a selection of the winner of a reality television show e.g. the Survivor reality show when the first person lands on Mars the winner of the next United States Presidential election or any other type of event.

Land based casinos generally restrict bettors to place their bets and pay for them on site e.g. in the casino . Because of this requirement it is thought that sports and event bettors will then play other games at the land based casino. For some casinos bets may also be placed by kiosks placed throughout the casino so that the bettor need not travel too far from where they may be playing other games to place bets. A few land based casinos presently take sports and event bets completely over the Internet where the bettor makes and pays for the bet on line. Additionally websites that exclusively perform on line betting and numerous Internet only casinos with no land based counterpart now take sports and event bets. There is a present and recurring need for new methods for making sports and event bets that are advantageous to both the bettor and to the bet taking establishment.

According to one aspect of the present invention a method for conducting event betting is provided. The method comprises acts of registering one or more bets by a bettor off site from a casino and accepting a payment made by the bettor for the one or more registered bets at a land based casino. According to one embodiment of the invention the act of registering includes an act of registering the one or more bets using interactive television. According to another embodiment the act of registering includes an act of registering the one or more bets using at least one of the Internet and a website. According to another embodiment the method further comprises an act of permitting the bettor to view at least one of the one or more registered bets. According to another embodiment the method further comprises an act of providing to the bettor a registration number for the one or more registered bets.

According to one embodiment of the invention the act of providing is performed by a website operator. According to another embodiment the method further comprises an act of permitting the bettor to pay for the one or more bets within the casino using at least one of a cashier a kiosk and a wireless interface. According to another embodiment the method further comprises acts of accepting by the casino a registration number from the bettor and confirming the registration number for the one or more bets. According to another embodiment the bettor is permitted to pay for the one or more registered bets with at least one of money and loyalty points. According to another embodiment the bettor is permitted to pay for the one or more registered bets by at least one of cash a debit card a credit card an account credit and a loyalty program credit. According to another embodiment the method further comprises an act of determining a payout for at least one of the one or more registered bets. According to another embodiment the payout for winning may include at least one of money a credit merchandise and loyalty points.

According to one embodiment of the invention the determined payout includes money and the method further comprises an act of paying out money including providing at least one of cash a check a debit card and an account credit. According to another embodiment the determined payout includes loyalty points and the method further comprises an act of paying out loyalty points including providing at least one of a loyalty program credit and an account credit. According to another embodiment at least one of a website operator and a computer system automatically determines if the one or more registered bets is a winning bet. According to another embodiment at least one of the website operator and computer system automatically notifies the bettor of the winning bet. According to another embodiment the bettor is automatically notified of a win in an electronic manner including by an e mail message by the Internet by a telephone and by a text message.

According to one embodiment of the invention odds for the one or more bets are set when the one or more bets are registered. According to another embodiment odds for the one or more bets are set when the one or more bets are paid for. According to another embodiment odds for the one or more bets change as the event approaches. According to another embodiment the method further comprises an act of requiring the bettor to return to the land based casino to receive winnings. According to another embodiment the event is a sports event.

Further features and advantages of the present invention as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings like reference numerals indicate like or functionally similar elements.

Bettors often enjoy the lively atmosphere of a land based casino when betting on sports or any other type event. Land based casinos foster this atmosphere by providing rooms for viewing sports or events and by hosting parties that draw many bettors including the Super Bowl and the NCAA Men s Basketball Championship. Land based casinos like to draw sports and event bettors so increase foot traffic through the casino and to hopefully increase gaming revenue.

However it is appreciated that betting on sports or an event may be inconvenient for a bettor when using a land based casino. A bettor must go to the land based casino to find out the bets taken and the odds a bettor will often go to the land based casino only if he or she is certain that he or she wants to place a bet on a specific event or sports activity. However with the advent of the Internet betting sites and the on line casinos the land based casinos are at a disadvantage to obtaining bettors that can get information on other betting opportunities more easily.

One aspect of the present invention relates to a system and method for conducting sports and event betting. According to one aspect the ease of using a network e.g. the Internet cellular and or other type of network is combined with sports and event betting at a land based casino. Thus sport and other types of event betting are improved as betting is more convenient to the bettor.

According to one embodiment a bettor may sign onto a website e.g. through the Internet and or other type of network to place a bet on any sports or other event including professional and college football soccer baseball basketball auto racing and ice hockey as well as cricket rugby and various sports tournaments including the NCAA Men s and Women s Basketball Championships and World Cup Soccer. Other events upon which a bet may be placed include any type of event such as for example choosing the winner of a reality television show e.g. the Survivor reality show when the first person lands on Mars or the winner of the next United States Presidential election.

According to one embodiment a website e.g. made available through the Internet or other type of network includes a listing of all the possible bets that may be made. According to another embodiment the bettor may then select the wagers to be made on line and register the wagers to be made with the casino. One advantage of this is especially apparent for complicated or multiple selection events that may involve multiple selections of events to occur. For instance a bet involving the entire NCAA Men s Basketball Championship Tournament which has 63 games and 64 teams is a complicated bet that may require multiple event selections. In another example choosing a fantasy league team e.g. for the National Football League NFL may have as many as 30 team members or positions and as many as 60 choices for each position further complicating the wagering process. However such traditional wagers were limited to being placed in the gaming establishment by the bettor. According to one aspect the bettor is permitted to arrange the bet outside of the gaming establishment and to make payment for the bet in a legal manner.

According to another embodiment a bettor may propose a bet for the website operator to consider. According to another embodiment a registration number is issued by the website operator if the bet is accepted. According to another embodiment the bettor then proceeds to the land based casino running the website and pays for the registered bet. According to one aspect by permitting the bettor to making the actual payment for the wager at the land based casino legal issues with Internet betting in the United States are reduced or eliminated. This method is believed to provide convenience to the bettor because the bettor can determine and place their bet s prior to going to the casino. Further such a method may provide additional foot traffic for the casinos to enhance play of their other games as bettors are required to travel to the casino to make payment.

At block the bettor reviews the available bets on the website. According to one embodiment the website may list all or some of the possible bets that may be made. The possible bets that may be shown may be determined according to the bettor s account or betting profile e.g. possible football bets will not be shown to a bettor not interested in football . Available bets may also be shown based on the historical betting behavior of the bettor.

Odds shown for a possible bet may be set or may be variable depending upon when the bet is registered or when the bet is paid for. For example a bet on the winner of the Major League Baseball World Series may have 6 1 odds after the regular season and before the baseball playoffs start 1 1 odds just before the World Series starts and 1 4 odds after the third game of the Series. For this example the odds of the registered bet may be determined at the time the bet is registered or at the time the bet is paid for. If the odds for a registered bet are determined at the time the bet is registered the land based casino may require payment for the registered bet within a specified time period e.g. one minute one hour one day one week one month etc. and this specified time period may shorten as the sports or other event approaches.

At block the bettor determines the bet s to make and at block the bettor registers the bet s . For instance the bets may be registered on a website e.g. through a communication network including the Internet cellular network etc. . The bettor may make a bet listed on the website. Alternatively or in addition to the offered bets that are listed the player may propose a bet not on the website. For instance in the case where a bet is not listed on the website the bettor may state the specific event that is being bet on and the bettor or the website operator may determine the odds to be given to the bettor for the bet.

When the website operator accepts the bet the website may provide a registration transaction or confirmation number to the bettor for the bet s at block . The bettor then proceeds to the land based casino at block for payment. For instance the bettor may proceed to a cashier a kiosk or other means available for paying for the bet s at the casino or other legal gambling jurisdiction. At block the bettor provides the bet registration number to the casino the casino confirms the registration number at block . At block the bettor pays the casino for the bet s and the bettor may obtain a betting slip showing the bet s placed and the odds on the bet s .

At block the event is held that determines the outcome of the bet and the casino determines if the bettor is a winner at block . If the bettor is a winner the casino then pays out the winnings to the bettor at block . To receive the winnings a bettor may be required to return to the casino. If the bettor is not a winner no payout occurs block .

At block it is possible that the bettor may need to make more picks on the same bet. For example a bettor may need to make more picks for second and other additional rounds of a multiple round tournament based upon the previous round s results. Such a tournament may include for example the FIFA World Cup in soccer or the NCAA Men s Basketball Championship. In such a tournament it is possible that a bettor may need to make all picks for all rounds before placing the bet.

When paying for a registered bet a bettor may pay for instance using money loyalty points combination thereof or any other payment method. In particular a bettor may pay using money by debit card credit card check cash or from an account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively or in addition to other payment methods a bettor may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The bettor may pay in person e.g. by using a cashier or by other methods within the casino including telephone handheld device or kiosk. Payment may be in any form that is legal in the particular jurisdiction.

The computer system or game operator may automatically determine when a bettor is a winner. Such a result may be automatically authenticated and verified by the computer system. In this instance the computer system may then notify the bettor that he or she has won and what the winnings are. Notification of winning to a bettor may occur by mail e mail computer web or network telephone television pager fax kiosk or any other method.

After a winner is authenticated and verified the computer system may then notify all bettors of the win. Additionally the computer system may display the winning bet the bettor s identity or the payout.

A bettor may also be able to replay or review a past bets using an audio enabled or video enabled device. For instance a kiosk telephone having a display television computer or handheld device may be used to view past bets. By accessing a selected bet in the computer system a game player may be able to see the event outcome the bet odds and the payout.

In one embodiment a computer system may be used to operate most acts of the betting operation including taking registering and paying out bets. For instance computer system s used to perform betting functions according to one embodiment may include single or multiple computer systems one or more of which may include a supercomputer a minicomputer a mainframe computer or a personal computer. A computer system used to run the betting operation may also include any combination of computer system types that cooperate to accomplish system level tasks.
