The present invention generally relates to solid state extrusion of semi crystalline fluoro polymer films more specifically to solid state extrusion of ferroelectric polymer films below the Curie transition temperature of the ferroelectric polymer.

Many polymers copolymers and polymer compositions can be fabricated into polymer films having a thickness of about 1000 micrometers or less. In general polymer film forming methods include solution casting melt pressing and melt extrusion. Solution casting involves pouring casting a solution of a polymer in a solvent onto a surface and evaporating the solvent leaving a film on the surface. Melt pressing and melt extrusion of thermoplastic polymers may include forming films by pressing a molten polymer between plates or extruding the molten polymer though a slit followed by cooling below the melting temperature of the polymer. Films with molecular orientation can be formed from semi crystalline polymer films by biaxial tensile drawing i.e. stretching the film utilizing methods known in the art. Polymer films may also be formed using compressional techniques which may include deformation of a polymer into a film by forging or extrusion of the polymer at or near the polymer melting point e.g. solid state deformation or extrusion .

Various semi crystalline organic polymers may have crystallites that may exist in more than one crystal morphology. These crystallites may be interconvertible while in the solid state. Typically such polymers may exhibit a solid solid transition that is a crystal crystal transition involving the inter conversion of the crystal forms at a particular transition temperature. Examples of such polymers include those referred to as ferroelectric polymers which often exhibit a crystal crystal transition from a ferroelectric crystal form to a paraelectric crystal form at a transition temperature known as a Curie temperature T. Semi crystalline fluoro polymers containing the vinylidene fluoride VDF group are a particularly relevant example.

It has previously been reported that solid state techniques may be used to produce films from semi crystalline polymers that have more than one crystal morphology that may be able to inter convert. However it has been reported that such techniques are only operable in a narrow temperature range between the crystal crystal transition temperature on the low temperature end and the melting temperature on the high temperature end see Zachariadcs A. B. Porter R. S. Eds. Marcel Dekker NY 1983 pp. 1 50. 

Solid state processing is thought possible in this range because the morphology of the crystallite that is stable above the crystal crystal transition temperature may have a lower modulus i.e. stiffness than the morphology of the crystallite that is stable below the crystal crystal transition temperature. Often it occurs that the higher modulus crystallite is too stiff to allow solid state processing below the crystal crystal transition temperature. see Aharoni S. M. Sibilia J. P. . 1979 19 pp. 450 455 and Aharoni S. M. Sibilia J. P. 1979 23 pp. 133 140 .

Reports of attempts of solid state processing of semi crystalline fluoro polymers include the following Peterlin and Elwell see Peterlin A. Elwell I. H. 1967 2 pp. 1 6 reported reducing the thickness and expanded the transverse dimensions by subjecting polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF films to a rolling action in the solid state at room temperature. PVDF is a semi crystalline VDF containing polymer that exhibits a crystal crystal transition at its Curie transition temperature T where the rhombohedral and hexagonal crystals are at inter conversion equilibrium. Importantly in PVDF the Tis very close to the melting temperature. As known to one of skill in the art PVDF may be referred to as ferroelectric polymer. PVDF polymer is capable of providing ferroelectric properties at temperatures below its Curie transition temperature. Peterlin and Elwell also reported that rolling the polymers through pinch rollers to compress the polymer substantially increased the orientation of polymer chains in the roll plane.

Nagai et al. see Nagai M. Uehara H. Kanamoto T. in Japanese 1996 53 pp. 555 561 and Nagai M. Nakamura K Uehara H. Kanamoto T. Takahashi Y. Furukawa T. J. Polym. Sci. Part B Polym. Phys. 1999 37 pp. 2549 2556 and Nakamura et al. see Nakamura K. Imada K. Takayanagi M. 1972 2 pp. 71 88 and Nakamura K. Nagai M. Kanamoto T. Takahashi Y. Furukawa T. J. Polym. Sci. Part B Polym. Phys. 2001 39 pp. 1371 1380 reported fabricating chain aligned PVDF films from PVDF gel films by solid state co extrusion to high draw ratios at 160 C. i.e. above the PVDF Curie transition temperature and about 10 below the PVDF melt temperature .

The chain orientation and crystallinity of the solid state modified films reported by Nagai et al. and by Nakamura et al. were significantly higher than that of PVDF films made by conventional melt extrusion and stretching processes. The degree of crystallinity the polar ferroelectric crystalline content and the Young s modulus of the films increased with draw ratio ultimately reaching a crystalline degree in the range 73 80 a polar crystal content of 100 and a Young s modulus in the draw direction of 10.5 GPa at the highest ratios. The ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties were also markedly enhanced and among the highest reported for polar crystal form of PVDF.

Cakmak M. 1993 33 pp. 1570 1582 reported extruded rods of polyvinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene copolymer p VDF TrFE at temperatures in the range of 120 to 150 C. which is above the Curie transition temperature range 70 115 C. of p VDF TrFE and below the melt temperature 150 C. of these copolymer compositions.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 282 277 4 341 927 4 363 611 and 4 449 905 are directed to tooling useful for the solid state extrusion of semi crystalline polymers. The exemplified polymers include polyolefins e.g. polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene and the like . The co extrusion temperature ranges recited were between the heat deflection temperature and the crystalline melting temperature of the polymer.

Accordingly solid state extrusion of polymers having a crystal crystal transition temperatures has been limited to temperatures in a range between above the crystal crystal transition temperature i.e. above the Curie transition temperature of a ferroelectric polymer and the melting temperature.

As can be seen there is a need for a method of solid state formation of ferroelectric polymer films at or below the Curie transition temperature of the polymer.

Accordingly this invention is a method to produce a semi crystalline fluoro polymer film. A semi crystalline fluoro polymer material is used. The material is compressed to produce the film. During compression the material is maintained at a temperature below the melting point of the material. The compression step can be cycled to allow cooling of the material between compression stages. Alternative methods are provided for compressing the material with a co extrusion substrate extruding the material and utilizing mandrel expansion for the material.

These and other features aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings description and claims.

The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention since the scope of the invention is best defined by the appended claims.

For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto and for ease of reference herein when a polymer is referred to as comprising a particular monomer the monomer present in the polymer is in the polymerized form. As used herein and unless otherwise noted the term polymer may include a homopolymer i.e. a polymer comprising essentially one monomer a copolymer i.e. a polymer comprising two or more monomers or a blend of homopolymers and or copolymers. A polymer which undergoes a crystal crystal transition need not be ferroelectric but may be ferroelectric. In addition for ease of reference it is to be understood that a ferroelectric polymer is a polymer capable of exhibiting ferroelectric properties when the ferroelectric polymer is at a temperature below its Curie transition temperature. As such a ferroelectric polymer need merely be capable of exhibiting ferroelectric properties within some temperature range.

Unless otherwise noted relevant polymers include the family of fluoro polymers preferably semi crystalline fluorine containing polymers more preferably VDF containing fluoro polymers. The simplest member of the family is the homopolymer PVDF formed by polymerizing the VDF monomer There are many relevant semi crystalline VDF containing copolymer or terpolymer compositions formed by the polymerization of VDF with one two or more additional monomers.

The present invention generally provides a method to produce a polymeric film in the solid state preferably a semi crystalline VDF containing fluoro polymer film. The method may comprise solid state deformation and or solid state extrusion of the fluoro polymer.

The method of the present invention is suitable at temperatures ranging from the glass transition temperature of the polymer up to the melting temperature of the polymer. Unlike the prior art the present invention is not limited to extrusion temperatures above the crystal crystal or Curie transition temperature of ferroelectric polymers. In fact the present invention provides for formation of semi crystalline fluoro polymer films and in particular ferroelectric polymer films over a broad temperature range extending from the glass transition temperature T on the low end through the crystal crystal or Curie temperature T to the melt temperature T at the high end. Thus films can be formed from a solid semi crystalline fluoro polymer at temperatures from just above its Twhere its amorphous phase is in a rubbery state and its crystalline content is in a ferroelectric state up and through its crystal crystal transition temperature where the amorphous phase is in its rubbery state and the crystalline phase converts from a ferroelectric to a paraelectric state. This was unexpected in view of prior literature reports that state that semi crystalline polymers can only be formed in their solid state at temperatures between their crystal crystal transition temperatures and their melting temperatures.

In an embodiment the polymers include semi crystalline compositions containing covalently bound fluorine. Examples of semi crystalline fluoro polymers suitable for use herein may include vinylidene fluoride VDF trifluoroethylene TrFE tetrafluoroethylene TFE hexafluoropropylene HFP 1 1 chloro fluoro ethane 1 2 chloro fluoro ethane chloro tetrafluoro ethane or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing monomers.

Preferred copolymer compositions of the present invention include poly VDF TrFE polymers. Poly VDF TrFE polymers having VDF TrFE ratios higher than about 50 50 weight to weight percent are preferable. Such ferroelectric polymers may be semi crystalline comprised of crystallites and an amorphous phase. The crystallites of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer exhibit a crystal crystal transition which may be a Curie transition involving the inter conversion of a ferroelectric crystal form for example an orthorhombic crystal form which is stable at temperatures below the Curie transition temperature to a paraelectric crystal form for example a hexagonal crystal form which is stable at temperatures above the Curie transition temperature.

The degree of crystallinity varies with processing conditions and preferably may vary from about 50 weight in as cast films to about 95 wt in annealed films e.g. films that have been heat treated. Crystallite size within these semi crystalline fluoro polymer films can vary from nanometer to micrometer dimensions.

The crystallites in PVDF and in VDF containing copolymers and terpolymers are known to crystallize in one or more of four crystal morphologies which differ in polarity. Crystal polarity is most affected by the orientation of the polar C

Crystallites including polar crystallites can be randomly oriented within a film such that no net polarization develops across the surfaces of the film either because the crystallites themselves are non polar or because polar domains within the crystallites are randomly oriented in the film. Typically the polar orientation of crystallites in a film can be aligned by strong applied electric fields a process known as poling. In this process randomly oriented polar domains within crystallites may be oriented so that the direction of essentially all of their polarities is aligned normal to the film surfaces.

In crystallites of semi crystalline VDF containing fluoro polymer films the polar orientation of domains within the crystallites can be aligned by applying an E field with a magnitude greater than the coercive field Ec . During alignment the dipoles on the polymer chain are caused to rotate to an orientation most closely parallel to the applied field.

In an embodiment the method of the present invention may include solid state deformation of semi crystalline fluoro polymers as shown in wherein a polymer sample which may comprise a semi crystalline fluoro polymer and which has an initial surface area is compressed to produce a semi crystalline fluoro polymer film having a final film surface area . Solid state deformation may thus result in radial deformation of polymer sample into semi crystalline fluoro polymer film . In an embodiment semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may be a ferroelectric fluoro polymer film.

The applying step of the present invention may comprise a compression pressure being applied to polymer sample . Preferably polymer sample is maintained at a compression temperature while the compression pressure is applied. The compression temperature may be below the melting temperature of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer below a crystal crystal transition temperature of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer and or below the Curie transition temperature of the ferroelectric polymer. The compression pressure i.e. compression force per unit area may be applied at a magnitude and for a period of time sufficient to increase the initial surface area of polymer sample relative to the surface area of the same semi crystalline fluoro polymer prior to the applying step to produce semi crystalline fluoro polymer film . This semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may have crystallites which can exist in two or more intra convertible crystal forms. After the applying step film thickness of semi crystalline fluoro polymer film which may be a ferroelectric fluoro polymer film is less than an original sample thickness of polymer sample . The desired film thickness may depend on the final application or use of semi crystalline fluoro polymer film .

Accordingly for purposes herein semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may comprise crystallites which can exist in two or more intra convertible crystal forms and may have a final film surface area which is greater than initial surface area of polymer sample prior to the applying step.

In an embodiment semi crystalline fluoro polymer film of the present invention may have a film thickness of less than or equal to about 1000 micrometers i.e. 1 mm . In another embodiment a semi crystalline fluoro polymer film of the present invention may have a film thickness greater than or equal to about 0.1 micrometers. Preferably film thickness of semi crystalline fluoro polymer film is about 100 micrometers or less preferably about 50 micrometers or less. Also preferably film thickness of semi crystalline fluoro polymer film is about 1 micrometer or greater preferably about 5 micrometers or greater with about 10 micrometers or greater being more preferred.

The amount by which initial surface area of polymer sample may be increased during the applying step to produce semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may be expressed in terms of a compression ratio which is defined for purposes herein as final film surface area divided by initial surface area. In an embodiment the compression ratio may be greater than 1 preferably greater than 1.1 more preferably greater than 1.5 still more preferably greater than 2 still more preferably greater than 3 still more preferably greater than 3.5 still more preferably greater than 4 still more preferably greater than 4.5 still more preferably greater than 5 still more preferably greater than 5.5 still more preferably greater than 6.

During the applying step polymer sample may be compressed at a compression pressure of greater than or equal to about 10 000 pounds per square foot lbs ft 0.480 MPa . Higher pressures are preferable to lower pressures. Most preferably the pressure should be greater than 150 000 lbs ft 7.2 MPa . The magnitude of compression pressure may be a function of the desired film thickness of semi crystalline fluoro polymer film produced.

In an embodiment the applying step of the present invention may be conducted e.g. compression pressure applied to polymer sample in a single step or in multiple steps. Application of compression pressure to polymer sample may however result in an increase in temperature of polymer sample . Accordingly to maintain the semi crystalline fluoro polymer of polymer sample below either a crystal crystal transition temperature e.g. a Curie transition temperature or the melt temperature or at or below another temperature as the case may be during the applying step compression pressure may be applied to polymer sample while polymer sample is being simultaneously cooled e.g. heat being removed . This may be accomplished by providing cooling to the compression components or apparatus and or to polymer sample itself either during the applying step before the applying step or a combination thereof.

In another embodiment the applying step may comprise a plurality of applying cycles. Each applying cycle may comprise the application of at least a portion of compression pressure to polymer sample followed by a resting period or step wherein no additional compressional pressure force is applied to polymer sample . In this way the heat generated during each of the applying cycles e.g. application of compression pressure resulting in a temperature increase of polymer sample may be allowed to dissipate either through natural convection or through active removal of the heat e.g. cooling of polymer sample cooling of the compression apparatus or both . Accordingly the applying step may comprise one or more applying cycles which may be repeated a plurality of times.

In one embodiment the applying step may comprise one or more applying cycles each applying cycle comprising the steps of applying at least a portion of the total compression pressure to polymer sample followed by maintaining that compression pressure for a rest period wherein heat may be removed from the sample from the extrusion equipment or both. In subsequent applying cycles the remainder of the total compression pressure may then be applied to polymer sample incrementally.

In an alternative embodiment the applying step may comprise one or more applying cycles comprising the steps of applying at least a portion of the compression pressure to polymer sample followed by a release of at least a portion of that compression pressure during the rest period wherein heat may be removed from polymer sample from the compression extrusion equipment or both. In subsequent applying cycles the remainder of the total compression pressure may then be applied.

In yet another embodiment the applying step may comprise one or more applying cycles comprising the steps of applying the total compression pressure to polymer sample followed by removal of at least a portion of that compression pressure during a rest period wherein heat may be removed from the sample from the extrusion equipment or both. In subsequent applying cycles the full or total compression pressure may be applied to polymer sample until semi crystalline fluoro polymer film having the desired properties has been produced.

In an embodiment the applying step comprises at least two of any of the above described applying cycles. Preferably the applying step comprises five or more of any of the above described applying cycles more preferably the applying step of the present invention comprises ten or more of any of the above described applying cycles.

The applying cycles may each apply an equal increase of the compression pressure to polymer sample such that the total compression pressure is applied in uniform increments e.g. such that the compression pressure of each applying cycle is increased by a uniform amount. In another embodiment compression pressure of each applying cycle may increase or decrease by a non uniform amount e.g. the total compression pressure may be applied using applying cycles wherein an increase in an amount of the compression pressure from one cycle to another is different than the increase in compression pressure between to other applying cycles. 

As shown in the method of the present invention may also include co forging polymer sample to produce semi crystalline fluoro polymer film preferably a ferroelectric polymer film. In this embodiment the method to produce semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may comprise a disposing step wherein polymer sample which may itself be an annealed polymer sample a film an annealed film a cast film or a sheet of initial surface area is disposed arranged and or mounted between two layers of a co extrusion substrate or co extrusion substrates and . In an alternative embodiment shown in and a plurality of discrete polymer samples may each individually be disposed between two separate layers of co extrusion substrate to produce a plurality of alternating layers of co extrusion substrate and polymer samples . Accordingly the disposing step may comprise arranging a plurality of discrete polymer samples each individually between a plurality of layers of co extrusion substrate to produce a plurality of alternating layers of the plurality of discrete polymer samples each layer being separated from another by one or more layers of co extrusion substrate and or .

Referring to during the applying step compression pressure is applied to polymer sample through co extrusion substrate at a compression temperature below the melt temperature preferably below a crystal crystal transition temperature and or below the Curie transition temperature of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer of polymer sample for a period of time sufficient to produce semi crystalline fluoro polymer film between the layers of co extrusion substrate . During the applying step both polymer sample and co extrusion substrate may undergo an increase in surface area. As described above semi crystalline fluoro polymer film has a final film surface area which is greater than initial surface area of polymer sample likewise semi crystalline fluoro polymer film has a film thickness which is less than original sample thickness of polymer sample .

As shown in the method of the present invention may also include a removing step wherein semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may be removed from one or more of co extrusion substrates once formed thereby rendering one or more layers of co extrusion substrate a sacrificial component of the inventive method.

The layers of co extrusion substrate and or may comprise the same material or may comprise different materials from one another. Co extrusion substrate may comprise a thermoplastic resin with polyamide resins Nylon being preferred.

In another embodiment of the present invention as shown in a semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may be produced by solid state co extrusion of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer. The method may comprise the steps of disposing polymer sample having an initial surface area between layers of co extrusion substrate to produce an extrusion billet . Similar to the embodiment shown in and extrusion billet may comprise a plurality of discrete polymer samples each individually disposed between two separate layers of co extrusion substrate and or and to produce a plurality of alternating layers of co extrusion substrate and polymer samples .

The co extrusion method may also include arranging extrusion billet within a die inlet of an extrusion die wherein extrusion die comprises die inlet in communication with a die outlet . Die inlet may have an inlet cross sectional area which is greater than an outlet cross sectional area of die outlet . The method may also comprise an applying step wherein compression pressure is applied against extrusion billet to force at least a portion of extrusion billet through extrusion die from die inlet to die outlet wherein the thickness of extrusion billet passing through die outlet is reduced relative to the thickness of extrusion billet passing through die inlet . Accordingly an extruded billet length of an extruded billet after extrusion is greater than a billet length of extrusion billet before extrusion. Semi crystalline fluoro polymer film is thus produced between the outer and inner layers of co extrusion substrate . During the applying step polymer sample is maintained at a temperature below the melting point of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer composition of polymer sample preferably below a crystal crystal or Curie transition temperature of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer. Accordingly semi crystalline fluoro polymer film so produced has a final film surface area which is greater than initial surface area of polymer sample . In an embodiment heat may be removed from extrusion die during the applying step or steps.

In another embodiment formation of semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may be accomplished by expanding polymer sample about an expansion mandrel . depicts an expansion mandrel disposed in an extrusion chamber having a concentric cylindrical arrangement i.e. having a circular cross section in particular a frustoconical shape. However expansion mandrel and the corresponding extrusion chamber may comprise any number of geometric cross sections.

Taking the embodiment shown in as an example an embodiment of the present invention may include a disposing step wherein polymer sample comprising a semi crystalline fluoro polymer and having an initial surface area not shown may be arranged between an outer layer of a co extrusion substrate and an inner layer of co extrusion substrate to produce a cylindrical extrusion billet dimensioned and arranged such that at least of portion of which is disposable about expansion mandrel . As such the layers of cylindrical extrusion billet may comprise a semi crystalline fluoro polymer sandwiched between outer layer and inner layer of co extrusion substrate which are dimensioned and arranged such that inner layer fits at least partially within outer layer . Cylindrical extrusion billet may then be radially arranged about a portion of expansion mandrel . In an embodiment expansion mandrel may comprise frustoconical shape along a central axis such that the diameter of expansion mandrel increases from one end to the other along collinear with central axis . Solid state extrusion of polymer sample according to the method shown in may produce a semi crystalline fluoro polymer film which may be bi axially oriented and semi crystalline.

The method may also comprise the applying step as disclosed previously wherein compression pressure is applied against cylindrical extrusion billet e.g. using a ram such that cylindrical extrusion billet is forced over expansion mandrel e.g. co linear with central axis . The applying step may thus result in the surface area of cylindrical extrusion billet not shown being increased to produce semi crystalline fluoro polymer film sandwiched between outer layer of co extrusion substrate and inner layer of co extrusion substrate . In an embodiment outer layer of co extrusion substrate may comprise the same material as inner layer of co extrusion substrate . In another embodiment outer layer of co extrusion substrate may comprise a different material than inner layer of co extrusion substrate .

To maintain the temperature of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer film during the applying step extrusion mandrel extrusion chamber and or ram may be cooled to maintain polymer sample at a temperature below the melting point of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer composition of polymer sample and co extrusion substrate composition s preferably below the crystal crystal or Curie transition temperature of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer of polymer sample during the applying step.

As shown in expansion mandrel may be concentrically disposed within extrusion chamber such that at least a portion of an inner wall of extrusion chamber is separated from an outer surface of expansion mandrel by an extrusion clearance distance . Expansion mandrel extrusion chamber co extrusion substrates and polymer sample are preferably dimensioned and arranged to produce void free semi crystalline fluoro polymer films . The dimensions of one or more of the various components shown in may allow for producing semi crystalline fluoro polymer films having varying degrees of polymer extension and alignment.

Accordingly in an embodiment the method of the present invention teaches production of a semi crystalline fluoro polymer film. This includes the steps of disposing polymer sample comprising a semi crystalline fluoro polymer between outer layer of co extrusion substrate and inner layer of co extrusion substrate . An extrusion billet is produced having an initial billet surface area not shown . An inner layer of extrusion billet is fitted radially about expansion mandrel and compression pressure is applied against extrusion billet . At least a portion of extrusion billet is forced over expansion mandrel such that a final surface area of extrusion billet is larger than the initial billet surface area not shown . This produces semi crystalline fluoro polymer film between outer layer and inner layer of co extrusion substrate . In an embodiment semi crystalline fluoro polymer film has a final film surface area which is greater than an initial surface area of polymer sample . Preferably polymer sample is maintained at a compression temperature below a melting temperature of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer of polymer sample during applying of compression pressure .

In a preferred embodiment outer layer and inner layer of co extrusion substrates comprise concentric cylinders wherein outer layer is dimensioned to be radially disposable about at least a portion of inner layer and wherein inner layer is dimensioned to be radially disposable about at least a portion of expansion mandrel preferably expansion mandrel has a frustoconical shape.

In an embodiment solid state co extrusion conditions as described herein may be manipulated to generate semi crystalline fluoro polymer films comprising conformational defects in crystallites. Such semi crystalline fluoro polymer films may exhibit enhanced strains and lowered dielectric and elastic hysteretic losses when excited by alternating applied E fields when compared to films prepared by casting or melt processing techniques. It is thought that the shearing which may occur under solid state deformation or solid state extrusion conditions disclosed herein reduces the crystallites of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer of polymer sample and introduces conformational defects into semi crystalline fluoro polymer films .

Semi crystalline fluoro polymer solid state processed films of the present invention may exhibit excellent elastic electrical dielectric and electromechanical properties which are an improvement over irradiated and or stretched films. Improved elastic properties gained by the inventive solid state processing can be designed to fabricate films with varying degrees of crystallinity and molecular orientation i.e. polymer chain extension and alignment . Varying degrees of uni and biaxial molecular orientation can be achieved with consequent enhancements in tensile strength and stiffness.

It has been discovered that films of the present invention may possess improved electrical properties over irradiated and or stretched films. Compared to the orientation and property enhancements that can be produced by tensile drawing solid state processing generates the molecular orientation under high compressional stresses. Accordingly semi crystalline fluoro polymer films of the present invention may have fewer voids and closer packed polymer chains than do polymer films known in the art contributing to higher densities and higher dielectric breakdown strengths over conventional semi crystalline fluoro polymer films.

Films of the present invention may also possess improved dielectric properties as compared to irradiated and or stretched films. The crystallites in p VDF TrFE films are organized in assemblies having a spherulitic shape. The compressional stresses in the disclosed solid state processing of the present invention can be used to deform i.e. squash the spherulitic assemblies which may cause a rearrangement of polymer chains in the amorphous and crystalline components of the spherulite and inter spherulite regions of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer. Rearrangement may be accomplished by the introduction of conformational defects. When the deformation and rearrangement occurs in a crystallite it may become a conformational defect in the polymeric films of the present invention. Conformational defects referred to herein may thus be departures from the all trans or tttt conformation of a perfect ferroelectric crystallite in p VDF TrFE films. The trans gauche t confirmation is an example of such a conformational defect when it occurs in an all trans crystallite. Conformational defects which occur in the inventive semi crystalline fluoro polymer films may add rotational mobility to the dipoles of the crystallite and thereby may lead to elevated and thus improved dielectric constants when compared to other semi crystalline fluoro polymer films known in the art.

Films of the present invention may also possess improved electromechanical properties as compared to irradiated and or stretched films. Conformational defects generated in the films by the methods of the present invention may also act to reduce the size of ferroelectric domains in crystallites and the size of crystallites themselves in the inventive semi crystalline fluoro polymer films. As such semi crystalline fluoro polymer films of the present invention having smaller crystallites and thus smaller ferroelectric domains as compared to known semi crystalline fluoro polymers may be polarized and switched in polarity more easily i.e. though use of lower applied coercive electric fields Ec and with lower hysteresis i.e. slimmer hysteresis in electric displacement vs alternating E field loops D E loops . Semi crystalline fluoro polymer films of the present invention may exhibit thickness and longitudinal strains x under cyclic E fields. Associated with this slim D E loop is a slim x E displacement vs. electric field hysteresis loop. The low energy loss associated with the thin hysteresis loops of the present invention may be a key property requirement of electro mechanical transducers e.g. actuators sound projectors and the like.

In an embodiment the semi crystalline fluoro polymers of the present invention are such that below the coercive field Ec the dimensions of polar p VDF TrFE crystallites may vary linearly with the strength of an applied electric field E field . As a result of the aggregate dimensional changes of all the crystallites in a film the film s dimensions may thus change as a function of an applied E field. For example in an embodiment of the present invention the semi crystalline fluoro polymer film produced may have a thickness or a film length and width that may vary under the influence of an E field applied to opposite faces of the film. A measure of the magnitude of this effect is the ratio d which is defined as the change in dimension x divided by change in electric field strength E d x E 

This property of the inventive semi crystalline fluoro polymer films may have important technological applications. For example the films of the present invention may be used as actuators or sound generators by utilizing the change in film dimension to cause low or high frequency stress or pressure waves in the environment around them when the films are actuated by low or high frequency E fields respectively.

In an embodiment the present invention may comprise semi crystalline fluoro polymer film produced according to any one of the methods either alone or in combination as disclosed herein. In an embodiment semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may have crystallites which can exist in two or more intra convertible crystal forms. In another embodiment semi crystalline fluoro polymer film may have a thickness of less than 1000 micrometers and greater than 0.1 micrometers. In an alternative embodiment the present invention may comprise an electrical device comprising semi crystalline fluoro polymer film produced according to any one of the methods either alone or in combination as disclosed herein.

Accordingly semi crystalline fluoro polymer film of the present invention may have applications as sensors of pressure low frequency stresses to acoustic and ultrasound frequency pressure disturbances since such applied stresses may cause changes in dimension of the film and consequent change in voltage in electrodes on the film the so called converse effect .

In the following examples semi crystalline fluoro polymer samples of 65 35 wt wt p VDF TrFE were deformed while in the solid state. The 65 35 p VDF TrFE composition is a semi crystalline fluoro polymer which exhibits an endothermic ferroelectric to paraelectric crystal crystal transition at temperatures in the range of 70 to 115 C. i.e. T 70 115 C. as observed by differential scanning calorimetry. 

Semi crystalline fluoro polymer samples used in the examples were circular plugs having an initial dimension of a 0.75 inch diameter 0.004 thickness were sandwiched between two nylon discs the co extrusion substrate and loaded into a 1 O.D. nylon tube to form a 1 O.D. 3 8 high assembly. The assembly was placed between the platens of a 100 000 lb ftpress wherein the compressional pressure was applied for solid state co forging. The platen had a temperature sensor mounted close within 0.05 to the polymer specimen to monitor any temperature rise that may have occurred during application of the compressional pressure.

Heat is generated during co forging and causes the temperature of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer nylon assembly to rise sharply. The heat may be generated by mechanical energy that is deposited i.e. energy not recovered in the semi crystalline fluoro polymer nylon assembly when compression stress is applied. This is V P work energy where V represents the volume of the p VDF TrFE polymer sample and the nylon sheets P is the change in compression stress or compression pressure. Since the mass of the nylon component is 50 100 times greater than that of the semi crystalline fluoro polymer sample most of the heat generated may be in the nylon component i.e. the co extrusion substrate .

A semi crystalline fluoro polymer film was formed by rapidly forging a film at 20 C. This deformation has an effect on the electric displacement vs. E field property i.e. the D E loop depicted using Sawyer Tower measurements of the electric displacement vs. electric field E at 1 Hz and 25 C. shows a comparison of D E loops for comparative annealed samples comparative irradiated semi crystalline fluoro polymer films and a ferroelectric film produced according to the present invention. As can be seen in the inventive solid state deformation has a similar effect on the D E loop as comparative irradiation. Both Example 1 and the comparative irradiated films exhibit slimmer D E loops compared to a comparative annealed film. The loops are slimmer because both the remanent polarization Pr and coercive field Ec parameters are smaller. This is evidence that solid state deformation of the present invention like irradiation introduces conformational defects into the semi crystalline fluoro polymer films.

In Example 2 an as cast polymeric film and an annealed semi crystalline fluoro polymer film of p VDF TrFE were compressed in one 3 second step with a 45 second hold time at the compression pressure. Heat was generated causing the instantaneous temperature rise from an initial temperature of 20 C. to about 78 C. After the applying step the Example 2 semi crystalline fluoro polymer film which was thinner and larger in surface area than the initial semi crystalline fluoro polymer sample. The semi crystalline fluoro polymer film was recovered by peeling away the nylon co deformation components. The compression ratio i.e. film surface area divided by initial area was 3.2 to 3.6. The films were deformed at temperatures below Tfor the semi crystalline fluoro polymer where the crystallites in the polymer film exist in a higher modulus ferroelectric form. The data is in Table 1.

In these experiments the maximum temperature seen by the films was controlled to be in the range 35 78 C. by chilling the forging assembly to 0 C. Example 3 12 C. Example 4 and 43 C. Example 5 prior to the applying step. These chilled assemblies were then compressed in one step lasting 3 seconds. Compression ratios of 2.2 to 3.2 were achieved. The temperature of deformation was always below Twhere the crystallites in the film were in the higher modulus ferroelectric state. The data are in Table 1 Examples 4 and 5 represent an average of 3 samples each.

This experiments illustrate that either as cast or annealed 65 35 p VDF TrFB polymer films can be co deformed according to the present invention. In these experiments the maximum temperature seen by the films did not exceed 25 C. This was achieved by chilling the assemblies to 50 C. and pressing in 5 applying cycles each comprising application of the full compression pressure in 3 seconds with a 45 second pause at that compression pressure followed by release of the pressure for a 60 second pauses to allow heat to dissipate.

Example 6 was co deformed from an as cast 65 35 w w p VDF TrFE polymer. Example 7 was co deformed from a 65 35 w w p VDF TrFE polymer composition that had been annealed at 140 C. for 19 hours to enhance its degree of crystallinity. The data are in Table 1.

The annealed film had a higher crystalline degree 62 than the as cast film 56 . Co deforming the as cast semi crystalline fluoro polymer film Example 6 and the annealed semi crystalline fluoro polymer film Example 7 increased the crystalline degrees to 80 and 88 respectively. A broader range of ferroelectric crystallite sizes in the film that was co deformed according to the method of the present invention from the as cast semi crystalline fluoro polymer is suggested by the more diffuse Curie transition in Example 6 see .

These experiments illustrate that double co forging of annealed films and high compression ratios are feasible. The film in Example 8 was formed from an as cast 65 35 p VDF TrFE polymer film that was annealed at 140 C. for 15 hours. The assembly of the annealed polymer film between nylon sheets was cooled to 50 C. and the compressional pressure applied in 9 steps of 3 to 7 seconds application followed by 45 seconds hold and then the pressure was released for 60 second pauses. This yielded a forged film with a compression ratio of 2.7.

The film in Example 9 was produced by applying a compression pressure to the film produced in Example 8 a second time. The Example 8 forged film was recovered and re mounted in new assembly between nylon sheets chilled to 59 C. and pressed a second time in 14 steps 3 second full compression pressure and hold for 45 seconds followed by release of the pressure for 45 second pauses. The final compression ratio of the double forged Example 9 film was 7.9.

In the following examples a technique for solid state co extrusion of p VDF TrFE films using the tool in is described. An extrusion billet was assembled consisting of the p VDF TrFE semi crystalline fluoro polymer mounted between close fitting nylon cylinders and inserted in an extrusion chamber over a smaller diameter end of an expansion mandrel. Co extrusion occurs when a ram forced the billet over the increasing diameter of the expansion mandrel. In the following examples the ram rate was 0.25 inches per minute for a product rate of 0.5 inches per minute resulting in a film area increase of 2 1. The compression pressure force was 12 000 to 17 000 lb f tfor an extrusion pressure of 18 000 to 26 000 pounds per square inch. The temperature range was ambient to less than 70 C. The film in the billet is extended both longitudinally and radially as it is forced over the expansion mandrel. Polymer chains in the extruded film are bi axially oriented in the plane of the film due to the biaxial flow axial and radial during extrusion.

These examples illustrate the use of tooling shown in to biaxially co extrude a film two times to achieve a cumulative biaxial area increase of 3.94 1 An as cast 65 35 p VDF TrFE semi crystalline fluoro polymer film was mounted between nylon tubes i.e. an inner co extrusion substrate and an outer co extrusion substrate to form an extrusion billet. The extrusion billet was fitted over a portion of the expansion mandrel located within an extrusion chamber and compression pressure was applied to a ram in contact with the extrusion billet.

In Example 10 a first co extrusion expanded the semi crystalline fluoro polymer in two directions axial and radial to yield an intermediate biaxially oriented film. The area ratio of the Example 10 film to the original semi crystalline fluoro polymer sample was 2.27 1.

In Example 11 the Example 10 film was remounted in new nylon cylinders an extruded a second time in the same direction to produce the Example 11 film. The area ratio of Example 11 to the as cast original film was 3.94 1.

These examples illustrate double co extrusion of a double layer of annealed semi crystalline fluoro polymer. Two layers of an annealed 65 35 p VDF TrFE semi crystalline fluoro polymer were mounted between nylon tubes to form an extrusion billet.

In Example 12 a first co extrusion expanded the film in two directions to yield an intermediate biaxially oriented semi crystalline fluoro polymer film. The area ratio of Example 12 film to the original film was 2.37 1.

In Example 13 the Example 12 film was remounted an extruded a second time in the same direction yielding the Example 13 film. The area ratio of Example 13 to the original un extruded polymer was 5.5 1. The double layer of doubly extruded film was easily peeled apart from each other and from the nylon. This demonstrates a means of increasing the productivity of co extrusion.

It is noteworthy that significant biaxial orientation and chain extension was generated in annealed 65 35 p VDF TrFE film by solid state co extrusion. Annealed films are not generally orientable by tensile drawing because they contain a high degree of large crystallites and as such they are often too brittle for tensile drawing.

It should be understood of course that the foregoing relates to preferred embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.
