The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of a royalty.

The invention relates to explosive materials. More particularly the invention relates to insensitive explosives. Most particularly the invention relates to melt cast mixtures of insensitive explosive materials and sensitive explosive materials.

Explosive materials are classified under a U.S. Department of Transportation standard as hazardous materials. Explosive materials are be sub classified in one of the defined sub categories from Mass Explosion Hazard 1.1 at one end of the scale to Explosive Article Extremely Insensitive 1.6 at the other end of the scale. The utility of an explosive is inversely related to its propensity to detonate. Utility in this sense means detonation insensitivity during handling transportation and storage.

Military munitions with a lower hazard classified explosives have the advantages of reduced vulnerability to sympathetic detonation detonation during transportation and handling and detonation with extended storage and temperature cycling.

Research at Livermore National Laboratory found that formulations of nitroguanidine and triaminotrinitrobenzene TATB were very resistant to accidental detonation. Extensive testing of PBX 9502 95 TATB 5 polymer binder resulted in a new hazard classification for Insensitive High Explosive IHE . The discovery of insensitive high explosives significantly reduced the requirements and therefore the cost of handling and storing these materials.

The Department of Defense Explosive Safety Board established hazard classification Class 1.5 for Insensitive Explosives to identify the significant insensitivity to detonation of triaminotrinitrobenzene TATB . New explosives have been found that have extremely low probability of round to round en mass reaction of projectiles containing the explosives. Explosives in this category are classified as Extremely Insensitive Detonating Substances EIDS in Class 1.6. These explosives are distinguished from blasting agents.

Use of reduced hazard classification explosives in conventional projectiles provides substantial advantages in operational readiness sustainability and survivability due to their reduced quantity distance QD storage and handling requirement restrictions and vulnerability. The use of detonation insensitive explosives also reduces the exposure of the public to potential hazard during transportation of munitions over public roadways.

Ammonium nitrate has been used in low melting point explosive compositions. The physical properties of ammonium nitrate present a number of disadvantages in explosives. It is hydroscopic which presents a maintenance problem over the storage life. It also requires a phase stabilizer which adds parasitic weight to any formulation and dilutes explosive performance. Other nitrate salts have also been used as explosives but they have an excess of fuel or some other disadvantage.

There is a need in the art for an explosive composition with reduced sensitivity to impact friction and shock. Sensitivity results in vulnerability of rounds projectiles bombs and warheads to cook off premature reaction and round to round propagation mass detonation and reactivity to the impact of bullets high velocity fragments shape charge jets electrostatic discharge and heat.

The invention is an insensitive explosive composition. The composition comprises diethylenetriamine trinitrate DETN and methyl nitroguanidine MeNQ in a molar ratio of 0.55 1 to 1.35 1. This composition includes the eutectic composition. The composition is characterized in the absence of ammonium nitrate.

The invention is also an insensitive explosive composition comprising a nitrate salt and a nitroguanidine in a molar ratio of 0.55 1 to 1.35 1. The nitrate salt is selected from the group consisting of diethylenetriamine trinitrate DETN ethylenediamine dinitrate EDD and mixtures thereof. The nitroguanidine is selected from the group consisting of methyl nitroguanidine MeNQ nitroguanidine NQ and mixtures thereof.

A eutectic mixture is a composition of two or more chemical compounds that melt completely at a temperature minimum to form a single homogeneous liquid. On cooling the homogeneous liquid solidifies to form a single solid comprising two intimately dispersed solid phases. The eutectic melting temperature is the lowest temperature at which a mixture of the chemical compounds melts. The eutectic melting temperature is anomalous in that it is usually much lower than the melting temperatures of mixtures of slightly different compositions. The melting temperature and the composition are unique and unpredictable physical properties of the eutectic.

It has been found that some oxidizers and fuels form eutectic mixtures. Accordingly the formation of eutectic mixtures has been used to provide the intimate mixing of oxidizer and fuel in explosive compositions. An additional benefit is the reduction in melting temperature. Melting a mixture in a casing is a convenient method of filling projectiles. This method is known as melt casting.

Melt casting includes heating an explosive composition to a temperature above the melting point optionally admixing any solid powders to the melt pouring the admixture into a cavity and allowing the admixture to cool and solidify.

Ethylenediamine dinitrate EDDN and higher analog salts form a double salt with ammonium nitrate AN . Ethylenediamine dinitrate EDDN and higher analogs also for eutectics with ammonium nitrate AN . In particular the double salt of diethylenetriamine trinitrate DETN and ammonium nitrate AN forms a eutectic.

Nitroguanidine NQ and methyl nitroguanidine MeNQ form double salts with ammonium nitrate AN . Methyl nitroguanidine MeNQ and ammonium nitrate AN also form a eutectic. However all double salts and eutectics formed with ammonium nitrate AN are sensitive to detonation.

Inventors have found that higher analog salts form low melting eutectics with oxidizers other than ammonium nitrate AN . The higher analog salts of particular interest for explosives include 

Interestingly useful eutectics have been found by combining one of these compounds or a mixture thereof with nitroguanidine NQ methyl nitroguanidine MeNQ or a mixture thereof.

Attention is drawn to a binary phase diagram of diethylenetriamine trinitrate DETN and methyl nitroguanidine MeNQ . The initial melting point of diethylenetriamine trinitrate DETN is nominally 150 C. and of methyl guanidine MeNQ is nominally 160 C. The eutectic composition was identified experimentally by the melting point minimum. This minimum was nominally 122 C. at 43 wt DETN and 57 wt MeNQ.

Following this discovery binary ternary and quaternary eutectic compositions were formulated between the fuels 

An optimum was discovered for the quaternary eutectic. The quaternary eutectic had a nominal melting point of 101 C. This optimum is the Best Mode contemplated by inventors for use as a desensitized explosive. The optimum composition comprises 

It is known to those trained in the art that composition variation in batches of the quaternary composition occur do to factors such as weighing and mixing. Compositions adjacent the quaternary eutectic composition are also useful. It is desirable to have a composition with a melting temperature below about 124 C. preferably below about 115 C. more preferably below about 105 C. The most preferred melting temperature is the eutectic melting temperature of 101 C.

CHEETAH thermochemical code is a computation method that predicts the performance of explosives and explosive mixtures based on thermodynamics and reaction kinetics. The prediction method was developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

Eutectics were analyzed using the computation method of the CHEETAH thermochemical code. The eutectics were found to have an explosive performance in the range of trinitrotoluene TNT and Composition B. Composition B comprises 39.5 wt trinitrotoluene TNT 59.5 wt cyclotrimethylene trinitramine RDX and 1 wt wax. Wax provides detonation desensitization.

Sensitive nitramines such as cyclotrimethylene trinitramine RDX have been added to the insensitive explosive of the invention to adjust shock sensitivity critical diameter and initiability. The combination of a sensitive explosive with the insensitive composition produces a low melting point solid in the absence of ammonium nitrate AN and associated detonation sensitivity. Inclusion of quantities of methyl nitroguanidine MeNQ and nitroguanidine NQ produces compositions that are inherently reduced in detonation sensitivity.

The insensitive compositions including the optimum quaternary eutectic are preferably used in combination with a sensitive explosive such as 

These sensitive explosives as well as the insensitive compositions per se are used in the absence of ammonium nitrate AN ammonium perchlorate AP lithium perchlorate or equivalent oxidizers.

Explosives of the invention were intended for use in the 155 mm artillery projectile. For this purpose compositions of the Best Mode insensitive explosive composition in combination with cyclotrimethylene trinitramine RDX were formulated and tested for sensitivity according to the Naval Ordnance Laboratory NOL Large Scale Gap Test LSGT . Test results are reported in Example 6 and graphically presented in a plot of Gap Pressure measured in kilobars kbar versus RDX content of the composition tested.

The Naval Ordnance Laboratory NOL Large Scale Gap Test LSGT is used to determine the sensitivity of an explosive composition to shock pressure. The test apparatus includes a blasting cap and booster charge to provide shock pressure a variable gap and polymethylmethacrylate PMMA gap separation cards for measuring the gap a steel tube container and a witness plate to verify detonation. In the testing procedure the gap is increased until the test material fails to detonate. The NOL LSGT was developed by the Naval Ordnance Lab NOL and is also referred to as the card gap test. Expanded Large Scale Gap Test ELSGT is similar to NOL LSGT at approximately double the scales.

During the test the gap i.e the separation of the test sample from the booster charge is measured by 0.01 inch thick polymethylmethacrylate PMMA cards. Each card indicates 1 kilobar of gap pressure. The test is reported as the number of cards or as the kilobars of gap pressure at which the sample fails to detonate. A wider gap at detonation indicates the test material is less shock sensitive. 70 cards is the nominal division between high detonation sensitivity explosives and low detonation sensitivity explosives. The test gives only a relative indication of sensitivity. The numerical value depends on sample size sample density void fraction sample preparation and characteristics of the test apparatus.

A quantity of the Best Mode insensitive explosive was divided into five portions. Cyclotrimethylene trinitramine RDX was added to four of the portions. The five portions were tested according to the Large Scale Gap Test. Results are reported in . Each point on represents a group of 7 NOL LSGT test measurements. The card gap is varied to find the 50 point. The pressure corresponding to the card gap is reported. This pressure is taken from calibration data.

Also shown in are the detonation sensitivity for two conventional 155 mm artillery shell fills. PBX 9502 is the upper horizontal line and AFX 757 is the lower horizontal line. PBX 9502 is an insensitive high explosive IHE comprising 95 triaminotrinitrobenzene TATB and 5 polymer binder. AFX 757 is an insensitive high explosive IHE comprising 25 cyclotrimethylene trinitramine RDX ammonium perchlorate aluminum powder and rubber binder.

It is desirable to have an explosive composition with an explosive effect measured by the Large Scale Gap Test LSGT between 50 and 70 kilobars. It is also desirable to have an explosive composition with Large Scale Gap Test LSGT between that of PBX 9502 and AFX 757. The desired explosive would be classified as an Insensitive Munition IM as specified in MIL STD 2105C. Inventors have found an explosive with these characteristics. This explosive comprises an insensitive explosive component and 6 wt to 9 wt cyclotrimethylene trinitramine RDX a sensitive explosive component. The insensitive explosive composition comprises 

Other applications may require an amount of sensitive explosive e.g. cyclotrimethylene trinitramine RDX in an amount of 2 wt to 75 wt . For example 5 wt to 10 wt is preferred for this application.

An insensitive explosive is high bulk density nitroguanidine HBNQ . Nitroguanidine is commercially available in a needle crystalline form having a low specific gravity and in a massive crystalline size having a high specific gravity. Either of these is useful for the invention. However the use of a particulate high bulk density nitroguanidine HBNQ is preferred for processing safety particularly in the presence of small amounts of water and for handling. A preferred composition of sensitive explosives is a mixture of particulate high bulk density nitroguanidine HBNQ in an amount of 10 wt to 60 wt and cyclotrimethylene trinitramine RDX in an amount of 2 wt to 25 wt .

The energy release rate and blast pressure of the explosive composition are increased with the inclusion of a metal powder. It is known that the particle size should be 100 mesh or finer preferably about 2 to about 100 microns. The powder will comprise about 0 wt to about 35 wt preferably 5 wt to 10 wt of the composition. The higher end of the range is used in under water explosives. In particularly powders of aluminum tantalum zirconium titanium boron and the like may be suspended in the melt cast explosive solid.

The invention was discovered by experimentation. Although inventors do not wish to be bound by any specific theory of the mechanism of the invention they have considered the scientific basis for it.

Military explosives such as trinitrotoluene TNT combine oxidizer and fuel in a single molecule resulting in a short diffusion distance between the moieties that cause in the chemical detonation reaction. This is also the case for explosives in which the oxidizer and fuel are combined to form a crystalline compound.

Ammonium nitrate AN has the disadvantage of excess oxidizing capacity for explosives. Ammonium nitrate explosives are sensitive to detonation. Other nitrate salts have been used as explosives but they have an excess of fuel or some other disadvantage. It would be desirable to find an explosive with an oxidizer fuel ratio near unity.

It is known to those skilled in the art that ammonium nitrate AN is difficult to handle and store. At temperatures below 32.3 C. the stable crystal is orthorhombic bipyramidal. At temperatures between 32.3 C. and 84 C. the stable crystal is orthorhombic. A sample of ammonium nitrate AN cycled multiple times through the 32.3 C. 90 F. crystal transition temperature experiences significantly increased shock sensitivity thereby increasing the hazard potential of the sample. This physical property is particularly undesirable in military ordnance.

A double salt is a compound comprising two different cations and one anion or one cation and two different anions. A double salt with an oxidizer fuel ratio of 1.0 provides more explosive potential than a mixture of the ingredients in the same ratio. Double salts have also been made from ammonium nitrate AN and diethylenetriamine trinitrate DETN . These double salts are energetic explosives however they are sensitive to detonation.

Military explosive formulations are often eutectic mixtures of fuel rich components such as ethylenediamine dinitrate EDDN nitroguanidine NQ with oxidizer rich components such as ammonium nitrate AN potassium nitrate KN calcium nitrate ammonium perchlorate and lithium perchlorate.

Inventors postulate that the explosive compositions are double salts of the nitrate salt and the nitroguanidine. Inventors have discovered that explosive double salts are formed with the exclusion of ammonium nitrate AN .

The density of compositions of Example 1 were calculated by CHEETAH thermochemical code and measured by gas pycnometry. Results of the calculations and measurements are reported in Table 2.

Compositions from Example 1 were evaluated in the laboratory for sensitivity. The data are reported in Table 3.

The physical properties of DEMN compositions were calculated and compared to that of trinitrotoluene TNT and Composition B. The calculated properties of DEMN compositions falls between those of trinitrotoluene TNT and Composition B. Estimates of detonation pressure P velocity D and energy H for DEMN DEMN III and DEMN IV are reported in Table 4.

Small scale sensitivity testing indicates DEMN variations i.e. combinations of DETN EDD MeNQ and NQ have a sensitivity suitable for military munitions. The impact friction and electrostatic sensitivities of DEMN and DEMN IV are listed in Table 3 along with kinetic and Henkin critical temperature data.

The Henkin bath test is used to determine the thermal stability of explosives by isothermally testing samples in a heated metal bath. A 40 mg sample of explosive is weighed and placed in a No. 8 aluminum blasting cap shell. The cap is then sealed. Testing is done on the sealed test samples at a series of temperatures. The test measures time to explosion. A graph is made from final data showing time vs. temperature to determine the thermal stability of the explosive sample cook off time and reaction rate . This thermal analysis combined with other tests such as impact sensitivity are used to determine proper explosive handling techniques.

The shock sensitivity of DEMN IV compositions was measured according to the Naval Ordnance Laboratory NOL Large Scale Gap Test LSGT . Results are reported in Table 6.

The shock sensitivity of DEMN as a function of RDX content is shown in . The desirable range of RDX that may be incorporated into DEMN is from 6 wt to 9 wt for detonation insensitive munitions IM . This is stated nominally as 5 wt to 10 wt .

A phase diagram for the diethylenetriamine trinitrate DETN methyl nitroguanidine MeNQ binary was constructed from laboratory measurements. Binary compositions were compounded over the range of 0 mol DETN to 100 mol DETN. The melting points of the compositions were recorded and was constructed from the data. The melting point of DETN was measured at 150.59 C. The melting point of MeNQ was measured at 160.77 C. A melting point minimum for the binary was found at approximately 122 C. The binary eutectic composition was 43 mol DETN 57 mol MeNQ. Data for the eutectic temperature and composition are shown in .
