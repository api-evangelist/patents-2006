This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. JP 2005 370755 which was filed on Dec. 22 2005 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus according to an electrophotographic process.

Image formation according to the electrophotographic process is widely employed in copying machines printers facsimile apparatuses and so on. In image formation according to the electrophotographic process a photoreceptor having a photosensitive layer which is formed on a surface thereof and contains a photoconductive substance is used. After the surface of the photoreceptor is uniformly charged by giving electric charges an electrostatic latent image corresponding to image information is formed through various image forming processes the electrostatic latent image is developed with toner supplied from a developing device to be a toner image and the resultant toner image is transferred and fixed to a recording medium such as a recording sheet.

In order to improve the quality of an image transferred and fixed to a recording medium and improve transfer efficiency that is a ratio of the amount of toner transferred onto a recording medium to the amount of toner of a toner image formed on a photoreceptor various transfer methods and fixing methods have been proposed up to now.

As an example of such transfer methods can be given a transfer method comprising the steps of transferring a toner image formed on a photoreceptor onto a primary transfer medium transferring the toner image transferred to the primary transfer medium to a secondary transfer medium having a heat source inside and transferring and fixing the toner image transferred to the secondary transfer medium to a recording sheet that is a recording medium refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication JP A 63 34572 1988 .

According to the technique disclosed in JP A 63 34572 it is possible by preheating toner on the secondary transfer medium to sufficiently heat the toner before transferring to a recording medium. According to the technique by making the temperature of the toner reach the neighborhood of a critical interface temperature on the secondary transfer medium and then transferring and fixing the toner to a recording medium namely a recording sheet at a fixing nip area it is possible to secure a fix level at a relatively low fixing temperature even in a high speed system machine. Moreover according to the technique adoption of a non electric field transfer system a thermal transfer system using heat makes it possible to increase transfer efficiency at the time of transferring a toner image from the primary transfer medium to the secondary transfer medium as compared with a case where a conventional electric field transfer system is adopted and makes it possible to obtain an image of higher quality with less toner scattering.

However the technique disclosed in JP A 63 34572 has a problem as described below. In the technique disclosed in JP A 63 34572 a silicone RTV room temperature vulcanizable belt having good surface smoothness is used as the primary transfer medium and a heating roller having a diameter of 120 mm provided with silicone RTV on an aluminum Al core metal having a halogen lamp inside is used as the secondary transfer medium.

In the technique disclosed in JP A 63 34572 toner is transferred from the photoreceptor belt to the primary transfer medium from the primary transfer medium to the secondary transfer medium and from the secondary transfer medium to a recording sheet. In a case where silicone RTV is used as a material of a surface layer of the transfer medium when toner is transferred from the primary transfer medium to the secondary transfer medium by thermal transfer the toner is likely to stick and remain on the silicone RTV surface of the primary transfer medium and division of toner namely toner offset occurs at a nip area between the photoreceptor belt and the primary transfer medium because toner releasability of silicone RTV is insufficient.

In a case where division of toner namely toner offset occurs part of the toner remains on the primary transfer medium and toner for forming a toner image later gets short with the result that there arises a problem such that image quality decreases. Moreover also when a toner image is transferred from the secondary transfer medium to a recording sheet because of the insufficient releasability toner offset occurs and toner remains on the secondary transfer medium with the result that there arises a problem such that image quality significantly decreases.

To solve such a problem of decrease in image quality due to toner offset in an ordinary fixing system it is necessary to apply a liquid having releasability such as silicone oil to the silicone RTV in order to increase toner releasability. However in a so called two stage transfusing system as disclosed in JP A 63 34572 that thermally transfers from the photoreceptor belt to the primary transfer medium and then from the primary transfer medium to the secondary transfer medium and thereafter transfers and fixes to a recording sheet there is an adverse effect by application of the silicone oil that is a problem of oil contamination of the photoreceptor belt and a developing portion with the silicone oil.

The cause of the above is that due to contact of the primary transfer belt and the photoreceptor belt with each other the oil reaches the photoreceptor belt from the primary transfer medium and adversely affects formation of an electrostatic latent image and formation of a toner image at the time of development. Further since the oil also reaches the inside of a development tank through the photoreceptor belt there is also a problem such that a failure in development is induced.

There is another adverse effect such that due to existence of the silicone oil having good releasability at a nip area between the primary transfer medium and the secondary transfer medium the secondary transfer medium acquires high releasability from the silicone oil and thermal transfer of toner from the primary transfer medium to the secondary transfer medium in a good condition is impossible. That is to say there is a problem such that a thermal transfer property is significantly impaired.

In the technique disclosed in JP A 63 34572 in order to avoid the problems resulting from use of the oil a release agent that gives releasability is added into a developer. By adding a release agent into a developer it is possible to realize an oilless system that allows transferring and fixing without applying silicone oil to a transfer medium and a fixing roller. However in the case of adopting the oilless system it is usual to form the surfaces of the transfer medium and the fixing roller with tubes made of a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether abbreviated to PFA or coat the surfaces with PFA. In the case of using a developer to which a release agent is added and obtaining desired releasability it is actually difficult to use a surface material other than PFA.

Since the silicone RTV illustrated as an example of the material of the surface layers of the primary and secondary transfer mediums in the technique disclosed in JP A 63 34572 has poor releasability it is presumed that decrease in image quality due to the poor releasability occurs on the primary transfer medium or on the secondary transfer medium even if a developer into which a release agent is added is used.

Further the technique disclosed in JP A 63 34572 also has a problem as described below from the perspective of power saving.

At present by the request for improvement of image formation efficiency a color copier a multifunction peripheral and so on are required to have a process speed of about 200 mm sec to 400 mm sec in general. However generally in the case of using the high speed process as described above the maximum power consumption far exceeds 1.5 kVA 100V 15 A that is an allowable limit of electric power of a commercial power source. Therefore it becomes necessary to prepare a large capacity power source when using a high speed process machine in an ordinary office home and so on.

Power consumption of a fixing portion forms the largest proportion in the details of power consumption of an image forming apparatus and it is necessary to set a fixing temperature high in order to prevent occurrence of toner offset when continuously printing a plurality of sheets at a high speed with the result that the power consumption tends to further increase.

Further since the number of sheets of image formation per unit time is large in the case of the high speed process heat of the surface of the fixing roller is removed by recording sheets while the recording sheets are continuously passing the temperature of the surface of the fixing roller rapidly decreases and it takes long hours before the temperature returns to a predetermined fixing temperature. In short there is a problem of so called decrease of a heat follow up property.

A conventionally used fixing system is a system in which after a toner image is transferred onto a recording sheet by the electrostatic action in a transfer portion a recording sheet is conveyed to a nip area formed between a pair of heated rollers a roller pair that is composed of a fixing roller having a halogen lamp inside to heat and a pressure roller pressing and contacting the fixing roller and that forms a nip between the rollers and toner is melted and fixed to the recording sheet at the nip area. In this system increase of the heat follow up property against decrease of the fixing temperature while sheets are continuously passing is attempted by making a rubber layer of the surface of the fixing roller thin or selecting a lamp of high wattage as the heating lamp installed in the fixing roller.

Accordingly in the high speed process machine in order to sufficiently fix while satisfying an offset property a heat source of high wattage is installed heating efficiency is increased by making a diameter of the fixing roller large and a fixing nip width is secured by winding an endless belt serving as a pressure member on the fixing roller so as to abut.

The technique disclosed in JP A 63 34572 adopts a method of using the heating roller having a large diameter of 120 mm as the secondary transfer medium that transfers and fixes transferred toner to a transfer sheet. In a case where the heating roller has a large diameter of 120 mm a space between the halogen lamp and the Al core metal serving as a roller core metal is too large and hence heat transfer efficiency is bad and it takes much time to increase the temperature. Further since a surface area of the secondary transfer medium is large the amount of heat radiated from the secondary transfer medium into the air is large and heating loss is large. Accordingly use of a large diameter roller as in the technique disclosed in JP A 63 34572 runs counter to energy saving because loss of electric power increases and causes a problem such that the aim of adoption of a transfuse system to fix at a high speed with small power consumption is not fully achieved.

Further since a time required for transfer of a toner image is short in the high speed process transfer efficiency is as low as 85 to 95 the efficiency of use of toner is bad and the amount of waste toner is large which leads to a lot of waste. Therefore in the high speed process it is desired to increase transfer efficiency and decrease waste toner production.

An object of the invention is to provide an image forming apparatus capable of transferring and fixing a toner image of high quality in a high speed process and forming an image having a good fixed level even at a relatively low fixing temperature by increasing transfer efficiency to reduce waste toner production.

a toner image bearing member provided in an image forming section for forming a toner image containing toner of one or two or more colors for carrying the toner image 

an intermediate transfer section to which the toner image is primarily transferred from the toner image bearing member 

a transfuse section to which the toner image is secondarily transferred from the intermediate transfer section and which thirdly transfers and fixes the transferred toner image to a recording medium and

a secondary transfer member disposed so as to press against the transfuse section through contact with the intermediate transfer section 

wherein pressure at a first nip area as a pressure contact area formed by the transfuse section and the secondary transfer member pressing against the transfuse section through contact with the intermediate transfer section is in a range of from 5.3 N cmto 20 N cm and

the transfuse section and the intermediate transfer section are configured to be driven at such speeds that a driving speed of the intermediate transfer section is higher than a driving speed of the transfuse section.

Further in the invention it is preferable that a ratio of the driving speed of the intermediate transfer section to the driving speed of the transfuse section is in a range of from 1.02 to 1.04.

According to the invention in the image forming apparatus that primarily transfers a toner image from the toner image bearing member to the intermediate transfer section secondarily transfers the toner image from the intermediate transfer section to the transfuse section and thirdly transfers and fixes the toner image from the transfuse section to a recording medium the pressure at the first nip area formed when the secondary transfer member disposed so as to press against the transfuse section through contact with the intermediate transfer section and the transfuse section press against each other is set to fall in a range of from 5.3 N cmto 20 N cm and the transfuse section and the intermediate transfer section are configured to be driven at such speeds that the driving speed of the intermediate transfer section is higher than the driving speed of the transfuse section where the ratio of the driving speed of the intermediate transfer section to the driving speed of the transfuse section is preferably set to fall in a range of from 1.02 to 1.04. Since the pressure at the first nip area and the driving speed ratio of the intermediate transfer section and the transfuse section are thus set in favorable ranges it becomes possible to increase the efficiency of transfer of toner from the intermediate transfer section to the transfuse section and decrease waste toner production and transfer a toner image without causing decrease in image quality.

Further in the invention it is preferable that the transfuse section includes a transfuse roller to which a toner image is secondarily transferred from the intermediate transfer section and

the transfuse roller has at least a rubber layer and the rubber layer has a hardness of 70 through 90 degrees in Asker C.

According to the invention the transfuse section includes the transfuse roller to which a toner image is secondarily transferred from the intermediate transfer section the transfuse roller has at least the rubber layer and the hardness in Asker C of the rubber layer is set to 70 through 90 degrees. Consequently the rubber layer is elastically deformed and can exhibit a good follow up property to asperities on a surface of a recording medium with the result that it is possible to prevent occurrence of micro offset and exert a scraping off force of scraping off toner by shear deformation of the rubber layer thereby realizing highly efficient transfer.

Furthermore in the invention it is preferable that the transfuse roller has a surface layer made of a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether.

According to the invention the transfuse roller has on the surface layer the application layer made of a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether expressed with an abbreviation of PFA hereafter whereby a thin surface layer having excellent releasability is realized. Consequently existence of the PFA application layer does not hinder elastic deformation of the transfuse roller and the rubber layer of the transfuse roller can maintain a good follow up property to asperities on a surface of a recording sheet with the result that it is possible to prevent occurrence of micro offset and exert a scraping off force of scraping off toner by shear deformation of the rubber layer thereby realizing highly efficient transfer.

Still further in the invention it is preferable that the transfuse section includes a pressure member pressing against the transfuse roller and

pressure at a second nip area as a pressure contact area formed by the transfuse roller and the pressure member pressing is in a range of from 13.3 N cmto 33.3 N cm.

According to the invention the transfuse section includes the pressure member pressing against the transfuse roller and the pressure at the second nip area that is the pressure contact portion formed when the pressure member presses against the transfuse roller is set to fall in a range of from 13.3 N cmto 33.3 N cm. Consequently it is possible to extend the life of the transfuse roller and prevent occurrence of micro offset.

Still further in the invention it is preferable that a circumferential length of the transfuse roller from the first nip area which is formed by the transfuse roller and the secondary transfer member pressing to the second nip area which is formed by the transfuse roller and the pressure member pressing is 50 mm or more.

According to the invention the circumferential length of the transfuse roller from the first nip area to the second nip area is 50 mm or more whereby it is possible to sufficiently preheat toner transferred from the intermediate transfer section by the transfuse roller before the toner is transferred to a recording medium. Consequently it becomes possible to secure a sufficiently good fix level of a toner image on a recording medium even if a fixing temperature is relatively low and obtain an image of high quality.

Still further in the invention it is preferable that the intermediate transfer section includes an intermediate transfer belt to which a toner image is primarily transferred from the toner bearing member and

According to the invention the intermediate transfer section includes the intermediate transfer belt and the volume resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt is set to fall in a range of from 1 10 cm to 1 10 cm whereby charge of the intermediate transfer belt is suppressed and it is possible to make toner separate in a favorable condition when thermally transferring a toner image from the intermediate transfer belt to the transfuse roller.

In brief the image forming apparatus comprises an image forming section that forms a toner image an intermediate transfer section to which a toner image denoted by reference symbol T in the drawing is primarily transferred and a transfuse section to which a toner image is secondarily transferred from the intermediate transfer section and which thirdly transfers the transferred toner image to a recording medium P and fixes to the recording medium P.

The image forming section includes image forming units and arranged in this order from upstream in a direction of arrow z that is a direction in which an intermediate transfer belt included in the intermediate transfer section described later is rotationally driven. Since the image forming units and have the same configurations except using black toner cyan toner magenta toner and yellow toner respectively corresponding portions will be denoted by the same reference numerals and moreover the individual units will be expressed by attaching b representing black c representing cyan m representing magenta and y representing yellow to the ends of the reference numerals as indicators representing the toner colors. The image forming units and the respective portions of the image forming units will be denoted by only the reference numerals in a case where generically called and will be denoted by attaching the alphabetical letters representing the toner colors described above to the ends of the reference numerals in a case where illustrated for the individual units.

Since the image forming units have the same configurations as described above a configuration of the image forming unit using black toner will be described as a representative and descriptions of the other image forming units will be omitted.

The photoreceptor drum is a roller shaped member arranged in an upper part of the image forming apparatus and supported so as to be freely rotated around an axis thereof by a driving mechanism not illustrated and on a surface thereof has a photosensitive layer for forming an electrostatic latent image corresponding to image information by irradiation of a laser beam from the exposure unit

The charging device is a charging member for uniformly charging the surface of the photoreceptor drum to a predetermined potential. As the charging device it is possible to use any of types of a roller type and a brush type as contact type a charger type and so on.

The exposure unit is constituted by a laser scanning unit LSU . The exposure unit irradiates the uniformly charged photoreceptor drum with a laser beam corresponding to image information for exposure thereby forming an electrostatic latent image corresponding to black image information on the surface of the photoreceptor drum

The developing device supplies toner of a developer held in a developer tank from a developing roller to the electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the photoreceptor drum thereby making the image visible that is forming a toner image. The developing roller is disposed so as to face the surface of the photoreceptor drum and so as to be capable of rotationally driven around an axis thereof and charged with electric charge in the developing device thereby supplying toner adhering to a surface of the developing roller to the electrostatic latent image formed on the surface of the photoreceptor drum

The cleaner unit eliminates and collects toner remaining on the surface of the photoreceptor drum after the toner image formed on the surface of the photoreceptor drum is primarily transferred to the intermediate transfer section .

In the image forming unit the surface of the photoreceptor drum that is rotationally driven is uniformly charged by the charging device an electrostatic latent image is formed by irradiation of a laser beam corresponding to image information from the exposure unit and development is performed by supply of black toner from the developing device to the electrostatic latent image whereby a black toner image is formed. After the toner image is primarily transferred to the intermediate transfer section toner remaining on the surface of the photoreceptor drum is eliminated cleaned up and collected by the cleaner unit . After that the same image forming operation is repeatedly executed.

With regard to the image forming units except the image forming unit the image forming unit forms a toner image corresponding to cyan image information the image forming unit forms a toner image corresponding to magenta image information and the image forming unit forms a toner image corresponding to yellow image information.

Referring to again the intermediate transfer section includes the intermediate transfer belt a driving roller a driven roller and primary transfer rollers and expressed by only reference numeral in a case where generically called disposed so as to correspond to the respective image forming units . The intermediate transfer section is arranged so that the intermediate transfer belt serving as a primary transfer medium contacts the photoreceptor drums below the image forming section .

The intermediate transfer belt extends over the driving roller the driven roller and the primary transfer rollers . The driving roller is provided with a rotation driving mechanism not illustrated . As the driving roller is rotationally driven around an axis thereof by the rotation driving mechanism the intermediate transfer belt is rotationally driven in the direction of arrow z.

The driving roller of the present embodiment is constituted by a hollow core metal made of steel whose wall thickness is 0.5 mm and a coating layer that coats the surface of the hollow core metal and is made of silicone rubber having a thickness of 100 m and the driving roller has a diameter of 50 mm. The coating layer is disposed for the purpose of increasing a friction force with the intermediate transfer belt and securing a driving force of the driving roller to the intermediate transfer belt . The intermediate transfer belt is wound on the driving roller at a winding angle of about 180 .

The driven roller is constituted by a hollow core metal made of steel and a coating layer as in the case of the driving roller applies tension to the intermediate transfer belt set thereon and makes a driven rotation by a rotation driving force of the driving roller transmitted via the intermediate transfer belt .

The primary transfer rollers are rotatably disposed so as to face the photoreceptor drums of the respective image forming units via the intermediate transfer belt . Transfer bias having a polarity opposite to those of toner images formed on the surfaces of the photoreceptor drums is applied to the primary transfer rollers and the toner images of the respective colors formed on the respective photoreceptor drums are primarily transferred to the intermediate transfer belt at the primary transfer rollers so as to be sequentially overlaid whereby a full color toner image is formed on the intermediate transfer belt .

In the present embodiment the intermediate transfer belt is 500 mm in perimeter. The belt basal member is made of polyimide having a thickness of 90 m for example. A conductive filler is mixed into the belt basal member whereby volume resistivity thereof is regulated so as to become 1 10 cm or more and 1 10 cm or less. As the conductive filler carbon black or the like is used. The volume resistivity can be measured with for example HIRESTA UP produced by Dia Instruments Co. Ltd. .

By using the intermediate transfer belt whose volume resistivity is within a range of from 1 10 cm to 1 10 cm charge of the intermediate transfer belt is suppressed and at a first nip area that is a pressure contact portion formed when a secondary transfer roller presses against a transfuse roller described later toner separates from the intermediate transfer belt in a favorable condition when thermally transferred secondarily transferred to the transfuse section .

In a case where the volume resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt is more than 1 10 cm once a charge potential of the intermediate transfer roller increases mainly bias for transfer is applied at the primary transfer rollers and the intermediate transfer belt is charged at the moment the potential is hard to decrease. As a result the intermediate transfer belt has a potential opposite to a charge potential of toner the toner is electrostatically attracted to the intermediate transfer belt and the toner is hard to separate from the intermediate transfer belt .

In a case where the volume resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt is less than 1 10 cm at the time of primary transfer in which toner is transferred from the photoreceptor drums onto the intermediate transfer belt toner scattering occurs because of the low volume resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt with the result that transfer efficiency decreases and decrease in image quality is induced because the scattered toner contaminates the inside of the apparatus and a recording sheet. Accordingly the volume resistivity of the intermediate transfer belt is set within the range of from 1 10 cm to 1 10 cm and preferably set to 1 10 cm.

In the present embodiment the release layer is formed by an application layer containing PFA namely a perfluoroalkoxy resin. The release layer is formed so as to have a thickness of for example 10 m and surface roughness Ra arithmetical mean roughness Ra specified by JIS B0601 of 0.6 m or less. By forming the release layer of PFA coating as a surface layer of the intermediate transfer belt it is possible to make toner separate in a more favorable condition in secondary transfer from the intermediate transfer belt to the transfuse section .

The transfuse section is disposed so that the transfuse roller and the pressure roller are aligned in this order above and below on a downstream side in the rotation driving direction z of the intermediate transfer belt with respect to the yellow image forming unit below and almost midway between the black image forming unit and the cyan image forming unit

The secondary transfer roller of the present embodiment pressing against the transfuse roller has a core metal made of aluminum having a columnar shape and an elastic layer made of foamed silicone rubber which is formed on an outer peripheral face of the core metal . For example the secondary transfer roller is 40 mm in outer diameter and the elastic layer is 5 mm in thickness.

It is preferred that the elastic layer of the secondary transfer roller has a hardness of 30 through 60 degrees in Asker C load 9.8 N . By setting the hardness of the secondary transfer roller to 30 through 60 degrees in Asker C load 9.8 N it is possible to form a uniform and wide nip area even at a low pressure force and realize favorable thermal transfer efficiency. In a case where the hardness in Asker C of the elastic layer is less than 30 degree there is a problem with durability because the secondary transfer roller causes plastic deformation. On the other hand in a case where the hardness in Asker C of the elastic layer is more than 60 degree the secondary transfer roller is so hard that it is impossible to secure a sufficient nip width a distance in a circumference direction of the nip area with the result that transfer efficiency becomes bad and hollow defects due to increase of surface pressure occur.

The secondary transfer roller is arranged inside the intermediate transfer belt and above the transfuse roller and presses against the transfuse roller arranged outside the intermediate transfer belt via the intermediate transfer belt by a pressuring mechanism not illustrated whereby the first nip area is formed.

The transfuse roller includes a hollow core metal an intermediate layer formed on an outer peripheral surface of the hollow core metal an application layer formed on the intermediate layer and a heater serving as a roller heating source disposed inside the hollow core metal . The transfuse roller is rotationally driven in a direction of arrow by a rotation driving mechanism not illustrated .

In the present embodiment the transfuse roller is formed so as to have an outer diameter of 40 mm. The hollow core metal is a tube made of aluminum having a thickness of 3 mm for example. The intermediate layer is for example a rubber layer made of silicone rubber and a hardness in Asker C load 9.8 N thereof is set to 70 trough 90 degrees.

In the case of using a silicone rubber material whose hardness is A5 degree in the spring type hardness test specified by JIS K6301 and whose thickness is 1.5 mm it is possible to set the hardness in Asker C load 9.8 N to 70 degree. In the case of using a silicone rubber material whose hardness is A20 degree in the spring type hardness test specified by JIS K6301 and whose thickness is 0.5 mm it is possible to set the hardness in Asker C load 9.8 N to 90 degree.

In a case where the intermediate layer is formed with rubber whose hardness is within the above range a deformation follow up property of the intermediate layer to minute asperities on a surface of a recording sheet is good and hence it is possible to prevent occurrence of a failure in image quality called micro offset and obtain an image of quality. Here micro offset is a phenomenon such that a rubber layer and a toner layer of a roller cannot sufficiently contact recesses of a recording sheet and toner at the recesses peels off after a transfuse process.

The hardness in Asker C load 9.8 N of the rubber layer forming the intermediate layer constituting the transfuse roller is within the range of from 70 through 90 degrees and it is preferred that the hardness is 80 degree. Assuming that the rubber layer has rather high breaking strength and also has deformability in consideration of prevention of occurrence of micro offset and durability of the intermediate layer it is preferred to use rubber whose hardness is A20 degree specified by JIS K6301 which is the lower limit to be durable. Moreover in consideration of thickness as the intermediate layer of the roller it is preferred that the hardness in Asker C load 9.8 N is 80 degree.

As an outermost layer of the transfuse roller the application layer of PFA is formed. Application of PFA allows forming a thin layer. For example in the case of forming the outermost layer of the roller with a tube it is only possible to form a layer of 20 m to 30 m in thickness because of a manufacturing process and a material. However in the case of forming by application it is possible to form a layer of 10 m in thickness.

By forming the thin PFA application layer it is possible to increase the deformation follow up property to asperities on a surface of a recording sheet without canceling elasticity of the intermediate layer . Therefore it is possible to prevent occurrence of micro offset and it is possible to sufficiently exert a scraping off force of scraping off toner by shear deformation of the intermediate layer and realize highly efficient transfer. Moreover since the PFA application layer has excellent toner releasability it is possible to form an image of quality on a recording sheet without causing toner offset.

The heater disposed inside the hollow core metal is for example a halogen lamp. A heating temperature of the transfuse roller is set and controlled by a temperature sensor disposed near the transfuse roller and a control power source that controls on off operations of the heater in response to detection outputs of the temperature sensor but the temperature sensor and the control power source are not illustrated in the drawing.

The secondary transfer roller presses against the transfuse roller via the intermediate transfer belt whereby the first nip area as a pressure contact area of both the rollers is formed. The transfuse roller and the secondary transfer roller press against each other so that pressure at the first nip area becomes 5.3 N cmto 20 N cm and preferably becomes 12 N cm.

In a case where the pressure at the first nip area is less than 5.3 N cm it is impossible to secure a stable nip width because of insufficient surface pressure with the result that a failure in transfer due to low thermal transfer efficiency occurs and the failure in transfer extremely deteriorates color reproducibility. On the other hand in a case where the pressure at the first nip area is more than 20 N cm there arises a problem that deterioration of images occurs because of toner filming and hollow defects and that plastic deformation of the secondary transfer roller occurs easily and the life of the roller gets short.

Grounds for calculation of the range of the pressure at the first nip area will be explained below. The nip width formed at the first nip area is 0.4 cm to 0.5 cm. In consideration of strength of the secondary transfer roller plastic deformation of elastic rubber occurs when a pressure force is too high and thermal transfer efficiency a favorable value of force given for forming the nip area is about 40 N to 120 N on one side. Converting this value into surface pressure a minimum value is given by an expression 1 and a maximum value is given by an expression 2 . In the expressions 1 and 2 30 cm is a length of the nip namely a length of the roller. 40 2 0.5 cm 30 cm 5.3 cm 1 120 2 0.4 cm 30 cm 20 cm 2 

Further at the first nip area the intermediate transfer belt is rotationally driven in the direction of arrow z the transfuse roller is rotationally driven in the direction of arrow and a ratio of a driving speed Vb of the intermediate transfer belt to a driving speed Vr of the transfuse roller Vb Vr referred to as a driving speed ratio hereafter is set to 1.02 to 1.04. Consequently it is possible to increase the efficiency of secondary transfer of a toner image from the intermediate transfer belt to the transfuse roller .

The following is presumed to be a reason for increase of the transfer efficiency by virtue of setting of the driving speed ratio Vb Vr in a range of from 1.02 to 1.04.

Since the speed Vr of the transfuse roller is slower than the speed Vb of the intermediate transfer belt a rubber part of the intermediate layer of the transfuse roller is stressed in the opposite direction to the rotation driving direction at the first nip area so that shear deformation is caused. However after passing through the first nip area the intermediate layer recovers from a sheared state and returns to its original shape. Force for returning to the original shape of the intermediate layer of the transfuse roller becomes a scrape off force of scraping off toner from the surface of the intermediate transfer belt with the result that the transfer efficiency increases.

In a case where the driving speed ratio Vb Vr is less than 1.02 it is impossible to cause sufficient shear deformation of the intermediate layer in the transfuse roller with the result that an effect of scraping off toner gets weak and it is impossible to obtain sufficient transfer efficiency. On the other hand in a case where the driving speed ratio Vb Vr is more than 1.04 the intermediate layer causes excessive shear deformation with the result that a lateral ruck is generated in parallel to an axial direction of the transfuse roller and decreases image quality and a white line caused by elongation of an image due to a difference in speed is formed outstandingly.

A full color toner image formed by primarily transferring toner images of the respective colors formed on the photoreceptor drums of the respective image forming units onto the intermediate transfer belt so as to be sequentially overlaid by the respective primary transfer rollers reaches the first nip area formed by the secondary transfer roller and the transfuse roller in accordance with rotation of the intermediate transfer belt in the direction of arrow z.

The toner image reaching the first nip area is thermally transferred onto the transfuse roller by the action of heat of the transfuse roller . At this moment it is possible to transfer the toner image with high transfer efficiency from the intermediate transfer belt to the transfuse roller because as described before the pressure at the first nip area is set within the favorable range the surface layer of the intermediate transfer belt is made with PFA having excellent releasability and the driving speed ratio Vb Vr is set within the favorable range.

The pressure roller includes a core metal an elastic layer formed on an outer peripheral face of the core metal and a coating layer formed on an outer peripheral face of the elastic layer . In the present embodiment the pressure roller is formed so as to have an outer diameter of 40 mm. The core metal is made of aluminum and formed into a columnar shape. The elastic layer is formed by silicone rubber. The coating layer is formed by a PFA tube. In a case where a halogen lamp is installed inside the core metal so as to be ready for a high speed process a hollow type core metal is used.

The pressure roller presses against the transfuse roller by a pressure mechanism not illustrated whereby a second nip area that is a pressure contact portion with the transfuse roller is formed. The second nip area is formed opposite the first nip area formed between the secondary transfer roller and the transfuse roller at an angle of almost 180 on a circumference of the transfuse roller .

The transfuse roller and the pressure roller press against each other so that pressure at the second nip area becomes 13.3 N cmto 33.3 N cm and preferably becomes 22 N cm.

In a case where the pressure at the second nip area is less than 13.3 N cm the intermediate layer of the transfuse roller cannot be deformed because the surface pressure is insufficient and cannot exhibit a deformation follow up property to recesses of a recording sheet with the result that micro offset occurs noticeably. In a case where the pressure at the second nip area is more than 33.3 N cmon the contrary it is possible to prevent occurrence of micro offset and increase a fix level. However after a continuous rotation driving time exceeds 500 hours or so there arises a phenomenon such that the PFA application layer of the transfuse roller peels off the rubber layer namely the intermediate layer and there arises a problem such that the intermediate layer peels off the hollow core metal of the transfuse roller .

Grounds for calculation of a range of the pressure at the second nip area will be explained below. A nip width formed at the second nip area is 0.4 cm to 0.5 cm. Force given for formation of the nip area needs to be large to a certain degree in consideration of strength of the roller the coating of the surface layer peels off and the rubber peels off the core metal when a pressure force is too high and in order to secure a transfuse property and effectively prevent occurrence of micro offset. Considering the above in total a favorable value of the force is about 100 N to 200 N on one side.

Converting this value into surface pressure a minimum value is given by an expression 3 and a maximum value is given by an expression 4 . In the expressions 3 and 4 30 cm is a length of the nip namely a length of the roller. 100 2 0.5 cm 30 cm 13.3 3 200 2 0.4 cm 30 cm 33.3 4 

Taking intermediate values of the nip width and the force the nip width is 0.45 cm and the force is 150 N on one side whereby it is possible to obtain 22 N cmas an optimum value of the pressure at the second nip area .

A toner image transferred from the intermediate transfer belt onto the transfuse roller at the first nip area of the transfuse roller is conveyed to the second nip area by rotation in the direction of arrow of the transfuse roller . In the process of conveyance from the first nip area to the second nip area toner on the transfuse roller is sufficiently heated by the transfuse roller . Therefore reproducibility of an image of dots and thin lines is increased by a moderate thermal cohesion action and solid density of a solid image is increased by filming by virtue of the action of a pulling force among toner particles with the result that it is possible to obtain an image of considerably high quality.

Accordingly a distance from the first nip area to the second nip area on the outer peripheral face of the transfuse roller is important to sufficiently heat the toner on the transfuse roller . By making the distance from the first nip area to the second nip area long it is possible to make a time to heat the toner long so that it is possible to sufficiently melt the toner on the surface of the transfuse roller .

In an image forming apparatus assumed by the invention in which a process speed is 100 mm sec to 400 mm sec in a high speed process it is possible by setting the distance from the first nip area to the second nip area to 50 mm or more to sufficiently heat the toner on the transfuse roller and exhibit the above effects.

In the present embodiment the first nip area and the second nip area are formed so as to be opposed to each other at an angle of 180 on the outer peripheral face of the transfuse roller . Therefore setting the distance from the first nip area to the second nip area to 50 mm or more is setting a perimeter of the transfuse roller to 100 mm 50 mm 2 or more. Since the outer diameter of the transfuse roller of the present embodiment is 40 mm as described before the perimeter thereof is 40 mm 3.14 125.6 mm. Thus the perimeter is set to 100 mm or more.

The toner image on the transfuse roller conveyed to the second nip area in accordance with rotation of the transfuse roller is at the second nip area thirdly transferred onto a recording sheet P conveyed to the second nip area by a sheet conveying portion not illustrated and fixed by heating and pressuring by the transfuse roller and the pressure roller thereby becoming a final image.

At the second nip area the nip width is a proper width for heating about 4 mm to 5 mm and it is possible to transfer and fix the toner image while heating the recording sheet P conveyed into the second nip area . Therefore at this moment a rapid decrease in temperature of toner does not occur at an interface between the toner and the recording sheet P and the toner sufficiently melted in advance in the process of conveyance by the transfuse roller penetrates far into fiber of the recording sheet P which allows obtaining a final image having a high fix level by an anchor effect.

Since the image forming apparatus thus allows heating and sufficiently melting the toner before third transfer on the outer peripheral face of the transfuse roller in the process of conveyance of the toner image from the first nip area to the second nip area it is possible to obtain a sufficient fix level when a fixing temperature of the transfuse roller is set to about 180 C. even when a process speed is 400 mm sec which is the assumed maximum speed. Accordingly it is possible to largely decrease the amount of electric power consumed by the fixing portion of the image forming apparatus whereby it is possible to hold down the maximum power consumption to 1.5 kVA 100V 15 A or less and it becomes possible to introduce the image forming apparatus to an ordinary office and home.

Further since the image forming apparatus performs secondary transfer and third transfer by the thermal transfer action a problem peculiar to electric field transfer such as occurrence of toner scattering or residual toner on the intermediate transfer belt decrease transfer efficiency does not occur. Accordingly it is possible to efficiently consume toner so that it is unnecessary to dispose a mechanism for collecting waste toner produced on the intermediate transfer belt or a cleaning mechanism for the intermediate transfer belt.

The invention is not limited to the above embodiment and may include various modified examples. For example although the image forming apparatus illustrated in the present embodiment is a color laser printer the image forming apparatus is not limited thereto and may be a monochrome image forming apparatus such as a monochrome laser printer an image forming apparatus formed as a color copier or an image forming apparatus formed as a multifunction peripheral provided with a plurality of functions such as a printer a copier and a scanner. Moreover although the illustrated intermediate transfer medium of the intermediate transfer section is the intermediate transfer belt the intermediate transfer medium is not limited thereto and may be a drum shaped one.

The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description and all changes which come within the meaning and the range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein.
