The present invention relates to e Commerce and more particularly to technology sharing during demand and supply planning in a network based supply chain environment.

The ability to quickly easily and efficiently communicate has always been a critical component if not a necessity for successful business operations. Today as the global economy continues to expand the ability to communicate is even more important. In partial response to these demands sophisticated telecommunications equipment has been developed that permits users to quickly and easily place receive transfer and switch telephone calls as well as provide advanced features such as call accounting and voice messaging functionality. As these features have become widely available in local telecommunications equipment such as private branch exchange PBX telephone switches central offices key and hybrid telephone systems small telecommunications switches call accounting systems voice messaging systems computer telephony interface CTI devices automatic call distribution ACD devices internet servers etc. the demand for and installation of these systems has continued to expand. Often a vast number of sites have layered or integrated two or more of the aforementioned devices and rarely are these different devices using the same operating system or of the same brand. More often these differing devices include a mixture of operating systems and brands.

Such a mix of advanced telecommunications equipment however still typically relies upon a significant amount of manual human interaction to install setup operate modify and maintain. Specifically when a new telephone switch such as a PBX is to be installed at a facility not only must the physical equipment itself be installed but the equipment must be configured and programmed to operate as desired by the users of the facility. In fact as more and more advanced features have become available in the equipment the burden on the equipment installer to initially setup and configure these features for the specific needs of the end user and the burden on the technician in maintaining and modifying the equipment the associated cable records for the equipment and cable and service activities has also increased.

When a telephone switch is accompanied by other telecommunications equipment such as voice messaging systems call accounting systems CTI devices wireless communication servers or ACD devices installation inconveniences are still further multiplied. Specifically many of these ancillary pieces of equipment require additional entry of user information that is duplicative of information already entered into the main telephone switching equipment. In such case not only must a technician program the main telecommunications switch but additional time and money must be spent for programming ancillary equipment with similar information. Typically these systems must be perfectly synchronized with each other or problems will occur. As a result the total cost of the installation is greatly increased and data entry error rates are greatly increased.

To further complicate the installation and management of this equipment each discrete change to one component of a telecommunications system often requires additional similar changes to several other components. Furthermore these additional changes typically must be done in a specific order and since the operating system design of each of the telecommunications devices often changes from manufacturer to manufacturer and from device to device by using an entirely different command structure for each different component. Therefore when done manually a technician must remember different command structures for each of the devices that require programming and also must remember the order in which the changes should be made and further may require different terminals passwords procedures software etc. Thus a highly skilled technician having familiarity with all of the various types of equipment that make up the telecommunications system must perform these changes or as is more common multiple technicians are required. Clearly with even a limited number of devices that require installation maintenance or programming the likelihood of an error is greatly increased.

Since modern telecommunications equipment provides substantial flexibility in programming to accommodate varying preferences of different users it is often necessary to begin the installation of such equipment by surveying users as to their desires and preferences so that these can be accurately reflected through programming of the equipment. This is typically done by distributing a questionnaire to each user to receive information sufficient to allow the equipment to be properly configured. Thus not only is there a substantial time commitment needed to review and enter the information received on such questionnaires into the equipment but significant effort on the part of each and every user is also required to complete the questionnaires. Typically collection of this data and entry of it must wait until the system is installed while in the present invention described below this information can be stored externally checked for omissions checked for errors or duplications and processed months in advance.

Such disadvantages are particularly highlighted when an outdated PBX or central office system is replaced with an improved system or a change is made in a present system. In such case each user is typically surveyed as to their preferences as above and this information is manually re entered after installation of the improved PBX or central office system. Thus since equipment upgrades impact each and every user in a facility a significant devotion of resources is required. As a result the benefits of advanced features provided by improved telecommunications equipment often does not outweigh the installation costs and thus many organizations either do not upgrade their equipment or delay such upgrades as long as possible.

There is thus a need for a supply chain intermediary to overcome these disadvantages particularly in an e Commerce environment.

A system method and article of manufacture are provided for technology sharing during demand and supply planning in a network based supply chain environment. Steps included are providing locator and mapping capabilities utilizing the network. Technology that includes streaming audio stereo audio and video data is also shared utilizing the network. Encryption capabilities for the technology are also included. Further searching capabilities are provided utilizing the network in addition to logging events and passive user profiling. The event logging includes logging network operations. User profile data is automatically received and stored. User profile data includes user identity state preferences and interests. User profile data is also automatically exported to an active profile manager which automatically adds additional user profile data. Additional user profile data includes information related to whether the user is a service provider or a manufacturer and the location of user.

A representative hardware environment is depicted in which illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation in accordance with one embodiment having a central processing unit such as a microprocessor and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus . The workstation shown in includes a Random Access Memory RAM Read Only Memory ROM an I O adapter for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units to the bus a user interface adapter for connecting a keyboard a mouse a speaker a microphone and or other user interface devices such as a touch screen not shown to the bus communication adapter for connecting the workstation to a communication network e.g. a data processing network and a display adapter for connecting the bus to a display device .

The workstation typically has resident thereon an operating system such as the Microsoft Windows NT or Windows 95 Operating System OS the IBM OS 2 operating system the MAC OS or UNIX operating system. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may also be implemented on other platforms and operating systems.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention is written using JAVA C and the C language and utilizes object oriented programming methodology. Object oriented programming OOP has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP.

OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects including the steps of analyzing the problem designing the system and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures it can be visualized as a self sufficient component that does not require other additional structures procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP therefore views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components called objects each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data structures and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.

In general OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint from which many objects can be formed.

OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality a piston engine comprises a piston valves and many other components the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.

OOP also allows creation of an object that depends from another object. If there are two objects one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine its piston is made of ceramic. In this case the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine depends from the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.

When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics but may have the same underlying functions associated with it e.g. how many pistons in the engine ignition sequences lubrication etc. . To access each of these functions in any piston engine object a programmer would call the same functions with the same names but each type of piston engine may have different overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.

With the concepts of composition relationship encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact our logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows 

With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality whether that reality is a physical entity a process a system or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.

If 90 of a new OOP software program consists of proven existing components made from preexisting reusable objects then only the remaining 10 of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90 already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10 of the program. As a result OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other previously built objects.

This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub assemblies. OOP technology therefore makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.

Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles such as encapsulation inheritance polymorphism and composition relationship. With the advent of the C language many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C is an OOP language that offers a fast machine executable code. Furthermore C is suitable for both commercial application and systems programming projects. For now C appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers but there is a host of other OOP languages such as Smalltalk Common Lisp Object System CLOS and Eiffel. Additionally OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.

Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus windows dialog boxes and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.

Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks calculating a mathematical table or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.

The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user rather than program logic to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse keyboard and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer s code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it s called by the event loop. Application code still sits on top of the system.

Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus windows and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.

Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows supports copy and paste and so on the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control and the programmer s code is called only when the framework needs it e.g. to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure .

A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user as is also true for event loop programs but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways as opposed to isolated programs having custom code being created over and over again for similar problems.

Thus as is explained above a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior e.g. for menus and windows and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.

Thus through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language HTML to implement documents on the Internet together with a general purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the Newco. HTTP or other protocols could be readily substituted for HTML without undue experimentation. Information on these products is available in T. Berners Lee D. Connoly RFC 1866 Hypertext Markup Language 2.0 November 1995 and R. Fielding H Frystyk T. Berners Lee J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP 1.1 HTTP Working Group Internet Draft May 2 1996 . HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. HTML has been in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML .

To date Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web based solutions. However HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas 

With lava developers can create robust User Interface UI components. Custom widgets e.g. real time stock tickers animated icons etc. can be created and client side performance is improved. Unlike HTML Java supports the notion of client side validation offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic real time Web pages can be created. Using the above mentioned custom UI components dynamic Web pages can also be created.

Sun s Java language has emerged as an industry recognized language for programming the Internet. Sun defines Java as a simple object oriented distributed interpreted robust secure architecture neutral portable high performance multithreaded dynamic buzzword compliant general purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform independent Java applets. Java applets are small specialized applications that comply with Sun s Java Application Programming Interface API allowing developers to add interactive content to Web documents e.g. simple animations page adornments basic games etc. . Applets execute within a Java compatible browser e.g. Netscape Navigator by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint Java s core feature set is based on C . Sun s Java literature states that Java is basically C with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution. 

Another technology that provides similar function to JAVA is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation 3 D virtual reality video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards work on multiple platforms and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group s building blocks are called ActiveX Controls small fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language HTML pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C Borland Delphi Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and in the future Microsoft s development tool for Java code named Jakarta. ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for JAVA without undue experimentation to practice the invention.

In an aspect of the present invention the information of the manufacturer may include information relating to the availability of the manufacturer offerings. In such an aspect the service provider may be notified of the availability of the manufacturer offerings that match the service installation information.

In one example of the present invention particularly applicable to installation of communication lines between telecommunications providers and their suppliers a method is provided for use in cooperation with a computer having memory in a Synchronous Optical Network SONET for generating an optimized transition plan for the placement of Self Healing Rings SHR and the routing of point to point demand in accordance with projected customer demand over a selected multi period time interval.

SONET is both a standard and a set of specifications for building high speed digital communications networks that run over fiberoptic cables while interfacing with existing electrical protocols and asynchronous transmission equipment. Fiberoptics has revolutionized telecommunications in view of the large bandwidth availability currently estimated in the hundreds of gigabits per second which continues to increase with technological advances such as wave division multiplexing and similar developments in light polarization and dispersion shifted fibers.

As those skilled in the art will recognize SONET specifies a digital hierarchy based on Optical Carrier OC rather than electrical levels. SONET does define Synchronous Transport Signals STS however which are electrical interfaces used as the multiplexing mechanisms within SONET Network Elements NE . Network elements combine STS as needed up to STS N where N is the number of STS then convert the total electrical multiplex to an optical carrier and transmit it over optical fiber. SONET is multiplexed at the byte level allowing services to be dynamically placed into the broadband STS for transport. The basic SONET of 64 Kbps per byte is the same speed as the conceptual voice channel DSO allowing SONET to easily integrate all currently used digital services into the optical hierarchy.

One of the principal benefits of SONET is that it allows for the direct multiplexing of current network services such as DS DSC DS and DS into the synchronous payload of STS . As those skilled in the art will recognize the above rates as in the case of most defined rates were developed based on existing transmission systems. For example the DS and DS signal rates 1.544 million bits per second and 6.312 million bits per second are the transmission rates of the T and T wire pair carrier systems. Initially one multiplexer called an M was used to combined four DS channels into a DS and a second multiplexer called an M was used to combine seven DS channels into a DS. Presently most networks use a single multiplexer termed an M which combines twenty eight DS channels into a DS. Of course one of the key attributes of these previous multiplexer designs is that they permit DS signals to be timed independently i.e. asynchronous multiplexing. Bits can therefore be sent at different transmission rates because individual channels need not be synchronized to a common timing source.

The asynchronous DS multiplexing standard was implemented in the days when most networks utilized analog technology and the few digital systems in existence generated their own clocking systems. Significantly the transmission specifications for DS signals specify that the bit rate is 1.544 million bits per second plus or minus 75 bps. To compensate for this range additional bits must therefore be stuffed into each DS signal before they are multiplexed to a higher rate. Again as those skilled in the art will recognize while bit stuffing supports independently clocked input signals it also makes it nearly impossible to locate individual DS or DSO channels within a DS bit stream. To extract a single channel a DS signal would need to first be demultiplexed through M components into twenty eight DSs before the channels could be switched or rearranged. As a result the process of adding or deleting channels is expensive.

In contrast to asynchronous multiplexing the SONET standard defines a viable alternative which supports greater capacity and efficiency. In the SONET multiplexing format the basic signal transmission rate STS operates at 51.84 million bits per second. AN STS can carry 28 DS signals or one asynchronous DS. STS signals are then multiplexed to produce higher bit rates STS STS etc. As referenced above the other term used to define the SONET signal levels is optical carrier. The bit rates are the same in each case so the bit rate of the STS equals the bit rate of the OC . The only difference is the type of signal that is being referenced. For example if the signal is in an electrical format it is referred to as an STS. Similarly if the signal is in an optical format compatible with a fiber medium it is referred to as an OC.

The SONET standards define an alternative to asynchronous DS multiplexing which describes how to divided STS signals into lower speed increments i.e. virtual tributaries. The major advantage of synchronous multiplexing is that when DS and other low speed channels are multiplexed directly into the STS format the lower speed channels can be identified and reconfigured for drop and insert. As a result the drop and insert process can be done simpler with less expense of hardware then the back to back M multiplexers used in asynchronous multiplexing.

Because of the large bandwidth availability in fiber and the growing volume of data traffic disruptions from link and node failures due to cable cuts for example become increasingly serious. Network survivability has therefore become a major concern for SONET designers and has fueled interest in what is known in the art as ring architectures. Such architectures take advantage of the capability provided by synchronous multiplexing in SONET to eliminate the need to backhaul traffic to central hubs. Thus at each switching office the SONET transport node directly accesses the required time slots in the bit stream through the use of modified Add Drop Multiplexers ADM . The SONET ring topology permits the creation of highly survivable networks which are viewed in the communications industry as essential for obtaining business for critical data communications.

In most cases the deployment of SONET rings results in cost savings since it is far less expensive for carriers to install a fiber ring then to deploy point to point links. Consider for example a rural route where linking remote terminals to a central office in a point to point application would require six multiplexers one at each site and at the Central Office CO for each route and six fibers two to each site. In a ring topology all that is required is one multiplexer at the CO and two fibers that go through a multiplexer at each site for a total of four multiplexers and two fibers. Significantly in the ring topology working or service traffic is routed in one direction only. If that fiber fails traffic is rerouted on a protection fiber to flow in the opposite direction. In this manner working traffic bypasses the failure to get to its proper destination.

Against this background it is readily seen that there is significant debate in the communications industry regarding the type and location of rings and in particular Self Healing Rings SHR to deploy. As those skilled in the art will recognize the directionality of service routing and the protection mechanism are key attributes that distinguish different self healing ring architectures. For example a unidirectional ring routes service traffic in only one direction of the ring. On the other hand a bidirectional ring routes the components of a duplex circuit in opposite directions on the ring. Similarly in a path switched ring traffic is protected on a per path basis and the switching is based on the health of each individual path where it exits the ring. Still further in a line switched ring switching is based on the health of the line between each pair of nodes. Thus when a line is faulty the entire line is switched off to a protection loop at the failure s boundaries.

The method and system of this example of the present invention utilizes selected mixed integer programs to efficiently model the information obtained during the iterative steps of the present invention in cooperation with a computer having sufficient memory. Such steps include the determination of nodes within the SONET under review identification of the number of periods within the selected time interval the determination of demand between nodes over this time period preferably in units of DS and the determination of discounted add drop costs for a plurality of selected Add Drop Multiplexers ADM s and related components based upon projected availability. If the number of nodes under review is small once this information is determined then the optimized discounted fixed and interconnection costs for this plurality of ADM s may be determined in accordance with a first selected mixed integer program. An electrical signal may thereafter be generated for receipt by the computer memory corresponding to a set of logical self healing rings with preliminary albeit detailed routing information. In contrast when the number of nodes under review is large a heuristic approach is required.

In the heuristic approach the user is required to load traffic to existing rings by repetitively identifying the smallest point to point demand between nodes on existing rings and assigning this demand to the rings until no demand left may be routed. Thereafter a proposed ring is created by identifying the greatest unsatisfied point to point demand between two adjacent nodes and assigning the nodes to the ring. At this point new proposed rings may either be randomly generated until all demand has been satisfied or in the alternative existing rings may be expanded. If the latter step is selected expansion is carried out by repetitively calculating the largest unsatisfied demand of neighbor nodes for each of the proposed rings and identifying a plurality of neighbor nodes having the greatest unsatisfied demand. At that point a determination may be made regarding the deficit of each of the proposed rings as well as the identification of a plurality of proposed rings with the greatest deficit.

Finally one of the rings with the greatest deficit may be assigned to one of the neighbor nodes and inter ring traffic may be loaded until all demand has been routed. Traffic is loaded through a process of repetitively identifying demand that can be routed the greatest distance through the smallest number of proposed rings and assigning that demand accordingly. At this point an electrical signal is summarily generated also for receipt by said computer memory and corresponding to a set of logical self healing rings with preliminary routing information.

Once logical rings have been determined whether in accordance with a mixed integer program or through repetitive iterations such as in the heuristic approach the placement of physical self healing rings and optimal traffic routing may thereafter be determined by retrieving the logical SHR and preliminary routing information from memory and maximizing the percentage of demand covered and minimizing the total inter ring traffic cost. This is accomplished through modeling the same in accordance with yet another mixed integer program and generating a corresponding electrical signal for receipt by said computer memory.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention illustrates a flowchart for a process for demand and supply planning utilizing a network where information from one or more service providers relating to demand of the service providers is received utilizing the network in operation . Received in operation utilizing the network is information from one or more manufacturers relating to the available supply of manufacturer offerings. The supply and demand for manufacturer offerings are compared to one another in operation and this comparison is used in operation to plan future supply and demand for the manufacturer offerings.

In an embodiment of the present invention collaborative forecasting may also be facilitated between service providers and manufacturers utilizing the network. In another embodiment of the present invention collaborative network roll out and planning utilizing the network may be facilitated between service providers and manufacturers. As an option a roll out planning tool may be provided for facilitating collaborative network roll out and planning between the service providers and the manufacturers utilizing the network. In a further embodiment of the present invention the supply of manufacturer offerings between manufacturers and service providers may be coordinated utilizing the network. In such an embodiment a supply chain planning tool may be provided for coordinating the supply of manufacturer offerings between the manufacturers and the service providers utilizing the network.

In even another embodiment of the present invention collaborative capacity planning may also be facilitated between service providers and manufacturers utilizing the network. In one aspect of this embodiment a production planning tool may be provided for facilitating the collaborative capacity planning. In yet a further embodiment of the present invention reverse inventory management may be conducted between the at least one service provider and the at least one manufacturer utilizing the network. Also the sharing of technology between service providers and manufacturers may be facilitated utilizing the network.

One exemplary embodiment of the present invention is adapted primarily for monitoring and controlling customer power demand in a utility such as electric gas and water. In particular this embodiment of the present invention is designed for the collection and transmission of user demand requirements and the control of user demand for utility services.

Domestic residential demand for electric power is growing at approximately 2 annually. Although utility companies can maintain pace with this growth by constructing more peaking and power plants this is not necessarily in the best interest of the utility companies and society at large. The factors of cost fuel availability and environmental concerns of both the utility company and the public in general have prompted a shift of emphasis from building additional generation capacity for satisfying the increasing demand to developing and employing a method and means of efficiency improvements production facility optimization and electrical conservation through demand side management. Implicit in this is the fact that not all electric power costs the same to generate. Power generated during peak times is more expensive than base line power. For demand side management utility companies will charge on a cost basis rather than an average use basis that has existed in the past.

Heretofore systems have been proposed for communicating utility usage at a customer s home to a central office. For example U.S. Pat. No. 4 086 434 discloses a remote condition reporting system including a microprocessor with memory and a firmware program telephone dialing equipment a clock and a plurality of inputs from meter readings and the outputs of sensors. The system initiates telephone calls to the utility company central offices at predetermined intervals to report utility usage including time of day power usage metering.

This embodiment of the present invention includes a monitoring and control system in which communication occurs through a fully distributed digital telecommunications switch without a centralized routing and handling facility. The distribution network is deployable to large numbers of residential and commercial customers for bidirectional real time communication. While initially designed for use with an electric power utility the invention is applicable in monitoring and controlling demand for other utilities such as gas or water as well as for data services.

A controlled load management and feedback system includes a power company central computer facility a plurality of home monitoring and control networks and one or more wide band distribution networks interconnecting home monitoring and control networks and the central computer facility. The distribution networks connect to one or more central computer systems through substation gateways via high speed digital lines.

The home monitoring and control network is located and operated within the power utility customer s home and includes electrical control monitoring and measurement devices which allow the utility to monitor electrical consumption in real time assist the customer in optimizing electrical power consumption and communicate real time consumption and changes in consumption to the power utility via the distribution network. Further the home network permits automatic meter reading and remote service disconnect and reconnect.

The distribution network includes a wire based hybrid fiber coaxial cable distribution system and an intelligent utility unit IUU which interfaces with the home network. The IUU controls communicates and configures devices within the home network and communicates information from the home network back to the utility central computer via the distribution system. The distribution network is configured in cells or small hubs which support 250 2 000 users at a time.

The utility central computer includes a T based communication digital backbone network which communicates with a distribution network through gateways typically located within a power substation. The backbone network consolidates traffic from different substations and routes the traffic to the utility host computer thus providing access to every user on the system. The host computer is able to forecast trends and predict when demand will exceed supply thus allowing corrective action to be taken. The computer can also generate reports for utility management and consumers showing usage and savings through demand management.

The following table is used to clarify terms used in this section of the description of the invention.

Data networks today rely heavily on shared medium packet based LAN technologies for both access and backbone connections. The use of packet switching systems such as bridges and routers to connect these LANs into global internets is now widespread. An internet router must be capable of processing packets based on many different protocols including IP IPX DECNET AppleTALK OSI SNA and others. The complexities of building networks capable of switching packets around the world using these different protocols is challenging to both vendors and users.

Standards based LAN systems work reasonably well at transfer rates up to about 100 Mbps. At transfer rates above 100 Mbps providing the processing power required by a packet switch interconnecting a group of networks becomes economically unrealistic for the performance levels desired. This inability to economically scale up performance is beginning to cause restrictions in some user s planned network expansions. Also today s data networks do not provide network managers with enough control over bandwidth allocation and user access.

Tomorrow s networks are expected to support multimedia applications with their much greater bandwidth and real time delivery requirements. The next generation networks should also have the ability to dynamically reconfigure the network so that it can guarantee a predetermined amount of bandwidth for the requested quality of service QOS . This includes providing access performance fault tolerance and security between any specified set of end systems as directed by the network s manager. The concept is to provide network managers with complete command and control over the entire network s infrastructure not just tell them when a failure has occurred.

A new set of technologies known as asynchronous transfer mode ATM may provide the best long term solution for implementing the requirements of both private and public internets. ATM promises to provide a more economical and scalable set of technologies for implementing the ultra high performance information networks that will be required to provide the quality of service users will demand. Thus over the next 20 years the network infrastructure may change from packet based standards to one based on ATM cell switching. While changes in the accompanying network will be dramatic it would be desirable for users making the transition to be able to retain their most recent equipment investment.

Another expected change in tomorrow s networks is a change in data flow. Data flow in today s network typically follows the client server computing model. This is where many clients are all transferring data into and out of one or more network servers. Clients do not normally talk to each other they share data by using the server. While this type of data exchange will continue much more of the information flow in tomorrow s networks will be peer to peer. Since the ultimate goal is a truly distributed computing environment where all systems act as both the client and server more of the data flow will follow a peer to peer model. The network will be required to provide more direct access to all peers wishing to use high performance backbone internets connecting for example the desktop computers.

The bulk of information transported in the future will be of digital origin. This digital information will require a great deal more bandwidth than today s separate voice fax and SNA networks which operate with acceptable performance using voice grade telephone lines. Voice will shrink as a percentage of total traffic while other forms of information including image and video will greatly increase. Even when compressing is available the bandwidth requirements for both inside and outside building networks will need to be greatly expanded.

Text files and images can be sent over existing packet based networks because the delivery of this information is not time critical. The new traffic voice and video is delivery time sensitive variable or excessive latency will degrade the quality of service and can render this information worthless.

The usefulness of packet switching networks for the transmission of digital information particularly burst type information has long been recognized. Such networks are generally point to point in nature in that a packet from a single source is directed to a single destination by an address attached to the packet. The network responds to the packet address by connecting the packet to the appropriate destination.

Packet switching networks are also used which combine burst type data with the more continuous types of information such as voice high quality audio and motion video. Commercialization of voice video and audio transmission makes it desirable to be able to connect packets to multiple destinations called packet broadcasting. For example a broadcast video service such as pay per view television involves a single source of video packets each of which is directed to multiple video receivers. Similarly conferencing capabilities for voice communication also require single source to multiple destination transmission.

One prior packet broadcast arrangement comprises a network consisting of a packet duplication arrangement followed by a packet routing arrangement. As a broadcast packet enters this network packet copies are made in the packet duplicating arrangement until as many copies exist as there are destinations for the packet. A translation table look up is then performed at the duplication arrangement outputs for each of the packet copies to provide a different single destination address for each copy. All of the packet copies with their new packet addresses are then applied to the packet routing arrangement which connects them to the appropriate network output ports.

In packet switching networks packets in the form of units of data are transmitted from a source such as a user terminal computer application program within a computer or other data handling or data communication device to a destination which may be simply another data handling or data communication device of the same character. The devices themselves typically are referred to as users in the context of the network. Blocks or frames of data are transmitted over a link along a path between nodes of the network. Each block consists of a packet together with control information in the form of a header and a trailer which are added to the packet as it exits the respective node. The header typically contains in addition to the destination address field a number of subfields such as operation code source address sequence number and length code. The trailer is typically a technique for generating redundancy checks such as a cyclic redundancy code for detecting errors. At the other end of the link the receiving node strips off the control information performs the required synchronization and error detection and reinserts the control information onto the departing packet.

Packet switching arose in part to fulfill the need for low cost data communications in networks developed to allow access to host computers. Special purpose computers designated as communication processors have been developed to offload the communication handling tasks which were formerly required of the host. The communication processor is adapted to interface with the host and to route packets along the network consequently such a processor is often simply called a packet switch. Data concentrators have also been developed to interface with hosts and to route packets along the network. In essence data concentrators serve to switch a number of lightly used links onto a smaller number of more heavily used links. They are often used in conjunction with and ahead of the packet switch.

In virtual circuit VC or connection oriented transmission packet switched data transmission is accomplished via predetermined end to end paths through the network in which user packets associated with a great number of users share link and switch facilities as the packets travel over the network. The packets may require storage at nodes between transmission links of the network until they may be forwarded along the respective outgoing link for the overall path. In connectionless transmission another mode of packet switched data transmission no initial connection is required for a data path through the network. In this mode individual datagrams carrying a destination address are routed through the network from source to destination via intermediate nodes and do not necessarily arrive in the order in which they were transmitted.

The widely used Telenet public packet switching network routes data using a two level hierarchy. The hierarchy comprises a long distance spanning backbone network with a multiplicity of nodes or hubs each of which utilizes a cluster of backbone switches and smaller geographic area networks with backbone trunks access lines and clustered lower level switches connected to each hub. Packet switched data is transmitted through the network via VCs using CCITT International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee of the International Telecommunications Union X.75 protocol which is a compatible enhancement of X.25 protocol.

For a communication session to proceed between the parties to a connection it is essential that data be presented in a form that can be recognized and manipulated. The sequence of required tasks at each end such as the format of the data delivered to a party the rate of delivery of the data and resequencing of packets received out of order is generally handled in an organized manner using layered communication architectures. Such architectures address the two portions of the communications problem one being that the delivery of data by an end user to the communication network should be such that the data arriving at the destination is correct and timely and the other being that the delivered data must be recognizable and in proper form for use. These two portions are handled by protocols or standard conventions for communication intelligently the first by network protocols and the second by higher level protocols. Each of these protocols has a series of layers. Examples of layered architectures include the Systems Network Architecture SNA developed by IBM and the subsequently developed Open Systems Interconnection OSI reference model. The latter has seven layers three of which are network services oriented including physical data link and network layers and the other four providing services to the end user by means of transport session presentation and application layers from lowest to highest layer.

X.25 is an interface organized as a three layered architecture for connecting data terminals computers and other user systems or devices generally refereed to as data terminal equipment DTE to a packet switched network through data circuit terminating equipment DCE utilized to control the DTE s access to the network. The three layers of the X.25 interface architecture are the physical level the frame level and the packet level. Although data communication between DCEs of the network is routinely handled by the network operator typically using techniques other than X.25 communication between the individual user system and the respective DCE with which it interfaces to the network is governed by the X.25 or similar protocol. In essence X.25 establishes procedures for congestion control among users as well as call setup or connect and call clearing or disconnect for individual users handling of errors and various other packet transmission services within the DTE DCE interface.

X.25 is employed for virtual circuit VC connections including the call setup data transfer and call clearing phases. Call setup between DTEs connected to the network is established by one DTE issuing an X.25 call request packet to the related DCE the packet containing the channel number for the logical connections the calling and called DTE addresses parameters specifying the call characteristics and the data. The destination DCE issues an incoming call packet which is of the same general format as the call request packet to the destination DTE the latter replying with a call accepted packet. In response the calling DCE issues a call connected packet to its related DTE. At that point the call is established and the data transfer phase may begin by delivery of data packets. When the call is compared i.e. the session is to end a call clearing procedure is initiated.

Prospective routing paths in the network are initially determined by a network control center which then transmits these predetermined paths to the backbone switches as routing tables consisting of primary and secondary choices of available links from each hub. The secondary choices are viable only in the event of primary link failures and the specific secondary link selection is a local decision at the respective hub based principally on current or recent traffic congestion patterns. The unavailability of an outgoing link from a hub at the time of the call setup effects a clearing back of the VC for the sought call to the preceding hub. An alternative link is then selected by that hub or if none is available there the VC circuit is again cleared back to the next preceding hub and so forth until an available path is uncovered from the routing tables. Messages concerning link and or hub failures are communicated immediately to the network control center and that information is dispatched to the rest of the network by the center.

In typical present day concentrators and packet switches the data processing devices reside in a plurality of cards or boards containing printed circuits or integrated circuits for performing the various functions of the respective device in combination with the system software. Typically the cards are inserted into designated slots in cages within a console with backplane access to a data bus for communication with one another or to other devices in the network. The VME bus is presently the most popular 16 32 bit backplane bus. References from time to time herein to cards or boards will be understood to mean the various devices embodied in such cards or boards.

Many public data networks PDNs offer little or no security for communications between users and hosts or other data processing devices within the network in keeping with the public purpose of the network and the desire for accessibility by a large number of actual and prospective users. Where restrictions on access are necessary or desirable it is customary to assign each authorized user an identification ID number or a password or both which must be used to gain access to the host. More elaborate security measures are necessary where access may be had to highly confidential data.

Some data communication networks involve a variety of different customers each of whom makes available a host and one or more databases to its users and may place a level of security on its database which differs from the level placed by other customers on their respective hosts and databases. In those instances it is customary to make the host responsible for security and access to itself and its associated database. Thus a user might have access to certain destinations in the network without restriction but no access to other destinations.

According to Yankee Group Research network management costs continue to increase with network managers spending an average of 45 percent of their budget on ongoing network management 20 percent on equipment and 35 percent on network transport services. It is a constant battle to reduce these costs yet somehow improve overall service to their customers. Reducing overall network management costs can be very difficult in today s business environment. Networks continue to become more complex with more and more demands being placed on the network managers and planners. For example the exponential growth of remote access has made their jobs more difficult as the requirement to establish and manage connections for remote offices and telecommuters is often required without additional personnel or budget resources. Unfortunately network managers and planners spend so much time in firefighting mode trying to support their complex networks that very little time is actually spent planning for network growth and enhancements. Combined with this is the fact that it is becoming difficult to keep highly skilled employees given the demand for certain skills in the marketplace and the premiums that will be paid for those skills. So what is a network manager to do More and more they are looking outside for help.

The market for customer network management services is generally referred to as Managed Networked Services MNS . Yankee Group estimates this market will estimated to grow from 3 B to 9 B within the next three years. MNS became the focus of service providers in 1995 as they saw revenues for frame relay network services double for two years in a row. What began as a way to boost the popularity of frame relay services by offering to lease and manage routers has blossomed into a diverse set of services that are now closer to those associated with outsourcing. Yankee Group research shows that 37 percent of Fortune 1000 managers are already outsourcing or plan to outsource their ongoing network operations management. In addition it is the communications provider that is thought of as the most likely provider for one stop shopping services.

The present invention s overall approach to implementing the NM MNS market offering is two fold. The current opportunity that presents itself is MNS. While this market opportunity for clients is large they need assistance in understanding data network management for years they have been solely focused on voice. Additionally they need to move into this market quickly in order to maintain and grow revenue. To this end the present invention includes a set of assets consisting primarily of job aids and software that can greatly reduce our clients lead time for service implementation.

Secondly the present invention assists service providers by providing them the tools to better manage their carrier data networks the packet switched networks of the future. The present invention significantly enhances and scales MNS assets to address carrier network management in a data networking world. This solution template enables the convergence of circuit and packet switching network control centers and workforces.

The present invention s market offering suggests companies take a graduated approach to delivering MNS. One end of the continuum consists of MNS for current network services including leased lines frame relay and X.25. On the far end is outsourced MNS characterized by long term contracts involving hundreds of millions of dollars. The NM MNS market offering is proposing our clients go beyond the management of the router and the WAN and into the world of the local area network LAN even as far as the desktop and business applications. Service providers have been intimidated by these propositions in the past since management of the LAN and its equipment and applications has clearly not been their forte.

It is hard to describe a typical MNS engagement because this is such a new. There are three entry points in which the present invention can become involved in helping our companies to move into the MNS market 

In an effort to clearly communicate exactly how we define NM MNS we have created an online catalog of services. The present invention s solution is a continuous cycle that begins with the four major processes associated with NM MNS. These processes drive the technology and the people components of the solution. Within each of these processes are a number of core functions and sub functions. The MNS Online Catalog contains all of this information including the supporting process technology and organizational solutions for each function.

Our solution is called the Managed Networked Services Integrated Solution MNSIS and has been developed using an approach which integrates Process Technology and People considerations.

Each process should be performed in order to provide a complete NM MNS solution. As mentioned above each process has a number of associated functions and sub functions that provide the complete picture of the process. The major functions associated with each process are as follows.

The main goal of the technology solution is to provide access to network information to make informed decisions. The present invention includes three layers of management element management information services management and presentation management. Every action starts with an incident. Processing is tailored to handling the incident with technology that responds to the unique characteristics of each incident.

The element manager communicates with the network elements to receive alarms and alerts through trapping and polling techniques. The element manager is the layer where the primary data reduction functions reside. At this layer events received at the element manager will be filtered aggregated and correlated to further isolate problems within the network. Information that is deemed critical to monitor and manage the network is translated into a standard object format and forwarded to the Information Services Manager. An element manager can be but is not necessarily software which adheres to open standards such as the Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP and the Object Management Group s OMG Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA .

The information services manager provides the data management and data communications between element managers and presentation managers. All information forwarded from the element managers is utilized by the information services manager to provide information to the network operators. The information services manager adheres to CORBA standards to provide ubiquitous information access via an Object Request Broker ORB . The ORB allows the information services manager to share management information stored in distributed databases.

The information services manager stores critical management information into operational real time and analytical historical distributed databases. These databases provide common data storage so that new products can be easily inserted into the management environment. For example if an event is received at an element manager that is deemed critical to display to a network user the information services manager will store a copy of the alarm in the operational database and then forward the alarm to the appropriate network operator.

Media and textual databases are also provided by the information services manager. The databases includes online manuals for administrative purposes as well as for the maintenance specialists to access element specific information. The databases also provide procedures policies and computer based training to network users.

The information services manager provides requested information real time and historical to the network users via the presentation manager.

The presentation manager performs the function its name implies the presentation of the information to an end user. Because different locations and job functions require access to different types of information there are at least two types of display methods. The first is for graphic intensive presentations and the second is for nomadic use such as field technicians. The first environment requires a graphic intensive display such as those provided by X Windows MOTIF. The second environment is potentially bandwidth poor where dial up or wireless access may be used along with more traditional LAN access. This is also where browser technology is employed.

The people vision for the NM MNS include an organization model for customer service support the corresponding roles and responsibilities for this organization model and a conceptual design for workforce transformation to packet switching.

Customer service support provides a single point of contact that is customer focused. This single point of contact provides technical expertise in resolving customer incidents troubles and requests. Generally a three tiered support structure is optimal for satisfying customer service needs. Each tier or level possesses an increasing level of skill with tasks and responsibilities distributed accordingly. Such a structure is as follows 

The above model is generally referred to as the Skilled Model because personnel at all three tiers are highly skilled. This model generally creates a high percentage of calls resolved on the first call. Other approaches include 

In this model users are requested to contact different areas via VRU depending on the nature of the incident. Calls are routed to the customer support representative best able to handle the call. This model can easily be coupled with the Skilled Model and has been at previous client engagements.

In this model Tier 1 only logs calls they do not resolve calls. One advantage of this model is that skilled resources don t have to waste time logging calls.

Managed Networked Services Integrated Solution The integrated network management solution template consists of a suite of best of breed third party software products that automate problem diagnosis notification custom developed reporting and IP services monitoring. This solution template is a great first step in realizing our technology solution vision.

Web Based SLA Reporting Tool is a browser based tool that provides the personalized SLA reports to customers in both a template and ad hoc format.

Data Mining Demonstration Provides the capability to analyze network management data looking for patterns and correlations across multiple dimensions. Build models of the behavior of the data in order to predict future growth or problems and facilitate managing the network in a proactive yet cost effective manner.

Customer to Event Mapping Module Add on module to the Managed Networked Services Integrated Solution which maps network element events to service offerings to customers. This tool allows the Customer Service Representative to proactively address network outages with customers.

Service Planning includes both the strategic and tactical planning required to manage distributed environments effectively. Although most planning typically occurs during rollout of the system certain planning activities must otherwise take place. Service Planning ensures that change can be successfully controlled and implemented.

Includes processes and procedures for handling necessary changes to systems or the organization in a distributed environment.

Systems Management consists of the day to day operational functions required to maintain the system e.g. fault detection correction security management and performance management .

Service Management controls the overall service to the users of the system. It isolates users from how the system is managed and ensures that users receive the quality support services they need to carry out their daily business activities.

The present invention includes a system method and article of manufacture for providing a hybrid circuit switched packet switched network. This hybrid network is used as a transitioning network to transition from old Core network architectures to New Core networks. In the present description the details of the NGN transitioning network will first be set forth after which details relating to specific billing aspects of the present invention will be described.

PSTN wireless and cable networks have continued to grow at their organic rates determined by the growth of the vertical services they were providing. In the beginning the data networks used a small portion of the backbone SONET bandwidth while PSTN was still the dominant bandwidth user. Due to the exponential growth in IP traffic the IP based data networks are soon slated to utilize more bandwidth than the PSTN. Also huge technical advances in packet technologies have made it possible to carry traditional voice over IP networks. This has started a move towards the Next Generation Network NGN where there will be more sharing of common network infrastructure to provide services and these services will start to become more interoperable. The main thrust of technologies in the NGN will be to provide interoperability between the new packet based infrastructure and existing legacy infrastructures. Due to the large investments made in the legacy infrastructure they will continue to exist for some time but most new innovations will occur on the packet based infrastructure. Slowly the parallel networks that were created to serve distinct services will merge to use a common packet based backbone and only differ in how access is provided wire line wireless cable satellite . The NGN is a transition network which will exist during the transformation from the current Core to the New Core .

As packet technologies continue to develop rapidly it will be possible to support what was once a distinct set of services voice video wireless on separate parallel networks on one integrated packet based network. There will still be separate access technologies wireless satellite cable wire line to access these services but the access networks will all use a common New Core network and its capabilities. The services will be interoperable across various access technologies and users will freely use services that cross many access technologies e.g. wireless to cable phone services web browsing from wireless devices etc.

The present invention maps a course for the network evolution from circuit to packet switched technology using a migratory approach in which the network becomes a hybrid circuit and packet topology over a 3 to 7 year period.

Next the network architecture for the wire line network as it transforms from Core to NGN to New Core will be described. Followed by architecture for cable wireless and satellite based access networks.

The current wire line Core network consists of parallel PSTN SMDS ATM Frame Relay B PRI and IP networks. The PSTN network has been evolving over the last century and is a mix of old and new circuit switched technologies. The PSTN network mainly provides point to point interactive two way voice communication services. The service set has evolved to include many intelligent network IN service features. During the late 1980s Advanced Intelligent Networks AIN emerged as the architecture to support new voice based services on the PSTN infrastructure.

The major IN requirements include session establishment advanced call processing call routing and call treatment network messages and call termination . Examples of applications and features are the CLASS family of services Call waiting Call forwarding Conference calling Call rejection enhanced call routing Number Portability Calling Card Services and Audio delivered Information Services e.g. travel stocks and weather .

These IN capabilities are enabled by devices such as SCP STP SSP and EIP in the AIN environment. These devices participate in the execution and completion of an IN service. In order to develop test and launch new IN service applications on the above mentioned components service providers deploy Service Creation Environment SCE platforms which provide an environment to quickly create new IN services. These SCE platforms are closely tied to the runtime environment and therefore with very few exceptions become a major undertaking and a complex coordination effort to launch a new or modified IN service in the Core network environment.

While the PSTN was growing in feature functionality as well as traffic demand new data networks have been created to support the inter networking of computing devices. These data networks provide interconnection to geographically dispersed computing devices at varying levels of transmission bandwidth e.g. 56 64K T 1 E 1 T 3 E 3 OC 3 STM 1 . The data networks consist of many technologies e.g. SMDS ATM frame relay and IP. In some cases these data networks themselves are parallel networks in other cases they share a common technology in the backbone e.g. ATM can be the backbone for frame relay and IP data networks . These data networks share the same SONET based backbone with the PSTN network. The services on the PSTN and the data networks are very distinct and non interoperable example voice versus web access .

With the rapid explosion of the Internet and innovation in packet based technologies the IP based data network has become the dominant network in terms of user traffic and its growth is slated to continue exponentially. This phenomenon has created a dilemma for traffic planners and engineers of the Core network. They have seen traffic grow on the access portions of their networks PSTN but have realized very little financial benefits from this usage because third party service providers have been the termination point of these internet data users. The incumbents have began to devise intelligent network solutions for this data traffic example RAS with SS7 gateway in order to solve two major challenges 1 off loading data traffic from the voice infrastructure to alleviate the congestion issues that face traditional voice customers and 2 collecting revenues from the third party data services providers ISP s for access and routing callers to their Points Of Presence.

Due to the high growth in IP and other data services many new service providers have emerged that are building only IP based data networks and provide only IP based data services. Their business strategy is to continue to ride the technological innovation of IP and packet based technologies and build complete suites of services on a packet based infrastructure. Because they are investing in only one form of network as opposed to many parallel networks their unit cost of services is low they are not encumbered by legacy networks and systems and they can provide cheaper and better services to customers hence they pose a significant threat to incumbent telecom service providers.

As packet based technologies continue to develop and provide the services that were only available on other networks e.g. PSTN cable and new green field service providers continue to exploit their advantage it has become necessary for many incumbent service providers to transition their Core network to the Next Generation Network where they can share the rapid technical advantages of packet technologies and improve their cost structure and at the same time offer new services on the Next Generation Network .

While there are components in the NGN that ensure interoperability between NGN and PSTN there are also a huge new set of new services that are built entirely on the NGN components which is provide feature rich multimedia voice video data based communication services as well as enabling many E Commerce services enabled by IP technologies. These components described later in detail include directories policies user authentication registration and encryption. These components enable services like integrated messaging multimedia conversations on demand multi point conference enhanced security authentication various classes of media transport services numerous automations in electronic internet commerce activities e.g. banking shopping customer care education etc. As the NGN matures third party value added service providers will develop IP based services that will combine applications such as electronic commerce procurement warehousing distribution and fulfillment as well as online banking to present the consumer with an integrated boundless shopping experience.

In addition to new service features the NGN also employs the use of new wire line broadband access technologies notably xDSL. Traditional wire line access technologies will continue to be deployed at higher and higher speeds wire line access will move from predominantly T 1 speeds to T 3 and OC n speeds. These new broadband access technologies will increase the need for higher bandwidth in NGN core. The NGN core continues to use a SONET backbone but will gradually move to using D WDM technologies to provide the bandwidth required to support broadband access.

New and emerging technologies such as Giga Bit Ethernet and Wire Speed IP may find their way to the network backbone but not until Giga bit Ethernet technology matures to handle a wide array of network services such as connection oriented circuit emulation. The use of Wire Speed IP technology is suitable for an enterprise network but lacks the robustness and scalability needed for carrier grade backbones. For this reason there will always be a need for ATM in the backbone.

The architecture in the NGN provides seamless interoperability of services between the packet based network and the traditional PSTN. New NGN packet based capabilities will be developed to support AIN type features while inter operating with legacy PSTN SS7 AIN. Large scale innovation in the IP based IN type capabilities e.g. global number transparency utilization of web based information rich media communications will create new services for IP enabled communication devices. Innovations on the PSTN will occur slowly and may be restricted to maintaining interoperability of legacy PSTN with NGN . In many cases legacy PSTN components e.g. SSP SCP will continue to evolve so that they can use common IP based packet switching technologies e.g. IP TCP UDP as opposed to using existing circuit switched technologies e.g. MTP .

Given the huge revenues and global nature of PSTN services as well as their use of SS7 and AIN technologies components that allow interoperability between NGN and PSTN will need to be developed. These will include IP PSTN Gateways IP PSTN address translators IP SS7 Gateways IP enabled SSP s and IP based Intelligent Peripherals. In addition to IN enablers new components as will be describe later with features like directories policies user authentication registration session encryption etc. will also be developed to enhance the IN capabilities. The NGN IN enablers will provide the next level of intelligence in order to address communication over mixed media types control of multiple session characteristics collaborative communications needs ubiquitous network access any to any communications and multimedia delivered information services. Note that these NGN components will continue to evolve to provide similar and enhanced capabilities in the New Core .

The following provides a description of new components in the NGN and the New Core that provide enhanced IP based services. The Intelligent IP IP Network enablers are categorized as follows 

The components for the NGN are described as individual functional units but may be combined for practicality on individual network devices as the requirements dictate. These components have been designed to operate in a distributed network environment to increase the flexibility of the NGN and New Core. The architecture provides a robust secure and isolated messaging infrastructure for delivering control plane information to these devices.

This infrastructure includes a well defined message set for accessing the functions that are provided by these components and data that resides in the rules database. The control plane architecture is efficient and has a unique mechanism for sharing service user and control data without duplication. This permits mobile NGN service users to maintain the same experience and have access to the same information regardless of where or how they access the network.

Example Assuming a US based NGN service user was roaming in Europe and wanted to access the network but has the use of specific calling information stored in his profile database in the US how would such a challenge be overcome without replicating the user s data onto every rules database on the NGN to ensure that the user would not be denied access to features and services which the user typically subscribed. Obviously storing or replicating this data and then managing synchronicity over a worldwide network would be process intensive costly and cumbersome. This intelligent network architecture addresses these issues efficiently with mechanisms that make remote data available locally for the duration of a session and then caches the information in short term non volatile memory not in the foreign rules database server. In other words although a user s profile may be physically stored in a Rules database in the United States the user may access the network from Europe and be automatically granted access to the specific services and features that normally would be available during his US service experience. The remote session controller in Europe would communicate with the cross network location register and rules database server to identify the subscriber s home rules database in order to collect the policies and profile of the subscriber for use in Europe this is done by using the inter device message sets command and control over the control plane sub network. Unlike other mechanisms often employed this mechanism does not replicate this information onto the local European rules database making long term control data management predictable. The design is CORBA compliant and therefore can be interconnected with other standards based networks.

This process or application is critical since it is the glue between the end user application and the communications network. It is responsible for collection and distribution of end user session preferences application requirements access device capability and accounting policy information to the required IN enabling components. In summary its main functions are to 

Similar to the Home location register in the wireless cellular telephony world. This functional component provides the required policies governing users who access third party networks and cross geographical boundaries. It keeps in constant contact with other cross network location registers of the geographically dispersed but inter connected networks exchanging accounting service feature profile and control data for local and roaming subscribers.

Most of the attributes of the New Core will already be in place as part of NGN . These include all intelligent components of the packet based NGN described above. The emergence of New Core signals the retirement of legacy PSTN network infrastructure. The traditional PSTN may never get removed from the public network it may continue to be available as a universally accessible telecommunication service highly subsidized and regulated by government agencies AMTRAK model . But for the purposes for business and technical innovation traditional PSTN network will largely become irrelevant.

As the PSTN based access methods go away entirely IP based access methods will emerge in the New Core where all end devices connected to the New Core are IP enabled. All existing methods of wire line based access xDSL T 1 T 3 fiber will continue to provide access to IP based services over the New Core . New access technologies e.g. power line will emerge but will still use the same packet based capabilities in the New Core .

The trends observed in the NGN will continue with increased broadband access. Other access methods cable satellite wireless will also complete their transformation to the New Core . These will all become IP enabled access technologies that will use the New Core for complete set of services thus really providing seamless services across many different access technologies.

The current wireless Core network consists of wireless based access and roaming capabilities that inter operate with wire line PSTN Core infrastructure to provide interoperable PSTN services. As the PSTN migrates to NGN and New Core the wireless PSTN access infrastructure will also migrate to connect to NGN and New Core to provide wireless PSTN access services while utilizing new capabilities in the NGN and the New Core . There will also be innovations in the wireless end devices such that they will become IP enabled and will thus allow a broad range of innovations by allowing mobility to the wire line IP based service capabilities e.g. web browsing e mail etc. . These wireless access methods to the New Core will be restricted to lower speeds due to the legacy nature of this wireless infrastructure while new broadband wireless access may emerge to provide a new set of IP enabled wireless devices that can provide broadband services over wireless mobile devices. In Europe significant improvements in technologies such as GSM have provided insight into some NGN and New CORE capabilities such as 300 Kilobits of access bandwidth to deliver information to hand held wireless devices. The potential of such capabilities coupled with the traditional strengths of wireless communications such as roaming and error handling enabled by digitization at this stage seems limitless when aggregated with the intelligence of the NGN and New CORE backbone.

LMDS is an emerging technology in the local high speed wire less access which utilizes the 25 35 GHz microwave spectrum for point to point and point to multi point communications. The end users either share an antenna connected to a digital receiver which is connected to a channel bank. The application server be it voice PBX video CODEC or Data Router or Switch interfaces with the NGN via the channel bank. A session originates from the application which interacts with the server to request authentication AAA then a session is established between originator and destination application by routing the call through the NGN components such as Gateways and Switches.

In addition to the wireless access infrastructure new service providers have emerged that are trying to use low earth orbiting satellites LEOS to build a new access as well as backbone network infrastructure. The earlier version of these networks were built using traditional PSTN service model hence they lack the bandwidth scalability for data services. In the New Core these will migrate to new packet switched based broadband LEO infrastructure which will provide both high speed access as well as high speed backbone in the packet based NGN and New Core . A satellite based broadband access mechanism will also be very suitable for multi point services that will be developed on the New Core .

Cable networks were developed for mainly broadband broadcast of analog video entertainment services. The current Core cable infrastructure is suitable to serve one way video broadcast. Cable service providers are now upgrading their cable infrastructure to support high speed internet access. Thus in the NGN scenario for cable networks cable will provide a new access mechanism for IP services while simultaneously transport video content using the current video broadcast technology. Thus the IP enabled devices attached to the NGN cable infrastructure can take advantage of all the new components and capabilities described in the wire line NGN . This will enable seam less services between devices that are accessing the NGN via a wire line or cable infrastructures. This NGN cable infrastructure can provide IP based telephony services using the same components of the wire line NGN that provide IP telephony to wire line IP devices.

The digital network segment that interfaces with the NGN comprises of a coaxial cable local loop which is connected to a cable data modulator running QAM DPSK protocols. The coaxial loop is terminated at the customer premise by an Ethernet cable modem which delivers the IP Tone to the applications Voice Video Data that may reside on a PC or application server. The cable modems used provide users and applications with a wide range of bandwidth options from 2 to 10 Mbits per second depending on configuration and choice of equipment vendor.

With the evolution of the New Core in the wire line the cable will continue to provide another broadband access mechanism for IP based services. As the New Core matures and enhances in capabilities probably 10 years away such that it can provide high speed real time video content to provide same quality as cable it can be envisaged that the cable will becomes an entirely IP access mechanism just like all wire line access becomes an IP access mechanism . Then the broadcast video content will be delivered to IP enabled cable attached devices just like any other rich media will be delivered over the IP network. It is even conceivable that video encoding technologies such as MPEG2 and motion JPEG will be further improved to deliver higher resolution digital media over the cable infrastructure using NGN and CORE delivery mechanisms. The network becomes transparent and the applications and content drive the creativity of the service creation process. The PSTN like services will be delivered to devices connected via cable access just like they are delivered to other wire line connected devices on the New Core .

Determine where our current network fits in the evolutionary continuum from CORE to NGN or New CORE. Having identified the appropriate positioning of the network select an architectural scenario that best serves business and technical objectives of the engagement.

Develop and launch a market trial that would measure and assess the viability of the introduction of the proposed service. Additionally this trial validates the approach to transform specific parts of the infrastructure towards the NGN and New Core . The market trial provides the entry exit criteria metrics Key Performance Indicators etc. to assess the success of the market trial.

Develop plan and manage the detailed network systems process and program management aspects of the launch of a New Core that is applicable for the network based on the strategy developed above. This ensures that the network systems planned and developed will be future ready. The OSS and back office systems are be able to support the processes required for service creation and management in the New Core . The network creation processes provides the program management tools to ensure that the launch is successfully executed. These include entry and exit criteria for network creation KPIs for quality management program planning and management tool kits.

As the network operator moves into operating and maintaining the NGN there will be many parallel market driven journeys during which services and capabilities will be developed for the NGN . The network creation process provides tools to assist the client into improving efficiencies of these parallel journeys. These optimization efforts will include organizational process and technology driven changes to create efficiency based on consolidation of processes as well as measurement tools to determine the success of such consolidation. The network architecture roadmap and business blueprint will act as the foundation to ensure that during the consolidation phase the NGN maintains the required architecture framework to sustain it for the long term.

Now that the details regarding the NGN have been set forth information will now be presented concerning billing when the quality of service is degraded.

A typical telecommunication network comprises multiple telecommunication switches located throughout a geographical area. When a user makes a call the call may be routed through one or more switches before reaching its destination.

Each of the switches is connected to two 2 or more Data Access Points DAP for instance a primary DAP and a backup DAP . A DAP is a facility that receives requests for information from the switches processes the requests and returns the requested information back to the requesting switch . The switches use information from the DAPs to process calls through the network.

When a call passes through one of the switches that switch creates a call record. The call record contains information on the call including but not limited to routing billing call features and trouble shooting information. After the call is terminated each switch that processed the call completes the associated call record. The switches combine multiple call records into a billing block.

When a switch fills the billing block the switch sends the billing block to a billing center . Thus the billing center receives one billing block from each switch that handled the call which in this case would be three billing blocks. The billing center searches each billing block and retrieves the call record associated with the call thereby retrieving one call record per switch that handled the call. The billing center then uses one or more of the retrieved call records to generate a billing entry. The billing center is also connected to each DAP to retrieve information regarding a switch or call record. However billing in the present invention is increased because the hybrid network also contains proxy intelligence.

The process provides sufficient and relevant information to verify compliance non compliance to Service Level Agreements SLA . The process provides sufficient usage information for rating and billing.

This process ensures that the Network Performance goals are tracked and that notification is provided when they are not met threshold exceeded performance degradation . This also includes thresholds and specific requirements for billing. This includes information on capacity utilization traffic and usage collection. In some cases changes in traffic conditions may trigger changes to the network for the purpose of traffic control. Reduced levels of network capacity can result in requests to Network Planning for more resources.

In addition to the Network Data Management generating billing events the present invention also uses a Customer Interface Management process as shown in to directly interact with customers and translate customer requests and inquiries into appropriate events such as the creation of an order or trouble ticket or the adjustment of a bill. This process logs customer contacts directs inquiries to the appropriate party and tracks the status to completion. In those cases where customers are given direct access to service management systems this process assures consistency of image across systems and security to prevent a customer from harming their network or those of other customers. The aim is to provide meaningful and timely customer contact experiences as frequently as the customer requires.

The Network Data Management and Customer Interface Management process are used to give information to the Customer Quality of Service Management Process as shown in . The Customer Quality of Service Management Process encompasses monitoring managing and reporting of quality of service as defined in Service Descriptions Service Level Agreements SLA and other service related documents. It includes network performance but also performance across all of service parameters e.g. Orders Completed On Time. Outputs of this process are standard predefined and exception reports including dashboards performance of a service against an SLA reports of any developing capacity problems reports of customer usage patterns etc. In addition this process responds to performance inquiries from the customer. For SLA violations the process supports notifying Problem Handling and for QoS violations notifying Service Quality Management . The aim is to provide effective monitoring. Monitoring and reporting must provide SP management and customers meaningful and timely performance information across the parameters of the services provided. The aim is also to manage service levels that meet specific SLA commitments and standard service commitments.

This process also encompasses taking appropriate action to keep service levels within agreed targets for each service class and to either keep ahead of demand or alert the sales process to slow sales. The aim is to provide effective service specific monitoring management and customers meaningful and timely performance information across the parameters of the specific service. The aim is also to manage service levels to meet SLA commitments and standard commitments for the specific service.

This proactive management also includes planned maintenance outages. The aim is to have the largest percentage of problems proactively identified and communicated to the customer to provide meaningful status and to resolve in the shortest timeframe.

The Problem Handling Process and the Network Data Management feed information to the Rating and Discounting Process as shown in . This process applies the correct rating rules to usage data on a customer by customer basis as required. It also applies any discounts agreed to as part of the Ordering Process for promotional discounts and charges and for outages. In addition the Rating and Discounting Process applies any rebates due because service level agreements were not met. The aim is to correctly rate usage and to correctly apply discounts promotions and credits.

Utilizing information from the Rating and Discounting Process the Invoice and Collections Process as shown in creates correct billing information. This process encompasses sending invoices to customers processing their payments and performing payment collections. In addition this process handles customer inquiries about bills and is responsible to resolve billing problems to the customer s satisfaction. The aim is to provide a correct bill and if there is a billing problem resolve it quickly with appropriate status to the customer. An additional aim is to collect money due the service provider in a professional and customer supportive manner.

Mediation and activity tracking are provided by the event logger and event manager. The event logger and event manager feed the rating and billing information for degraded service using the personally customized rules database. Utilizing an expert system for the tailored capabilities of each customer the event driver collector and manager analyze notification events generated by the system. When a notification event is received the system analyzes the event and uses it to identify the customer. The notification event is also used to credit the customer if they experience a non impacting event that breaches the customer s contract. In addition to the system itself generating the notification event the customer is also able to notify the provider directly should such an event occur.

In a second step events are generated based on the quality of service of the media transfer. As discussed above with reference to and these events include performance notifications due to SLA violations and customer generated events from the Customer Interface Management Process .

In a third step the events generated in step are utilized to generate a bill for the customer. In addition to normal billing for service provided via the hybrid network the bill is modified based on events generated during the media transfer. For example events representing SLA violations are used to credit customers. As discussed above with reference to and the Problem Handling Process is responsible for receiving service complaints and other service affecting problems. Together with the Network Data Management the Problem Handling Process feeds data to the Discounting Process . The Discounting Process applies the correct rating rules on a customer by customer basis and applies discounts for events such as outages and other SLA violations. Finally the Invoice and Collections Process utilizes the information from the Discounting Process to create customer billing information.

To better understand the invention it is useful to describe some additional terminology relating to a telecommunication network. A telephone call comes into a switch on a transmission line referred to as the originating port or trunk. The originating port is one of many transmission lines coming into the switch from the same location of origin. This group of ports is the originating trunk group. After processing an incoming call the switch transmits the call to a destination location which may be another switch a local exchange carrier or a private branch exchange. The call is transmitted over a transmission line referred to as the terminating port or trunk. Similar to the originating port the terminating port is one of a group of ports going from the switch to the same destination. This group of ports is the terminating trunk group.

Contemporary telecommunication networks provide customers with the capability of using the general public network as well as the capability of defining a custom virtual network VNet . With a VNet a customer defines a private dialing plan including plan telephone numbers. A VNet customer is not limited to the default telephone numbers allocated to a public telecommunication system dedicated to a specific geographic region but can define custom telephone numbers.

Upon processing a telephone call a switch must generate a call record large enough to contain all of the needed information on a call. The call record however must not be so large that the typical call results in the majority of the record fields in the call record to be unused. In such a case storing such call records results in large amounts of wasted storage and transmitting such a call record causes unnecessary transmissions.

One solution for creating and processing call records is to implement a fixed length call record format such as a 32 word call record. A word is two 2 bytes or sixteen 16 bits. A fixed length record format however cannot expand when new call features are implemented. More importantly fixed call record formats cannot handle expanded data fields as the telecommunications network becomes more complex with new features and telephone numbers.

Contemporary fixed length record formats include time point fields recording local time in three 3 second increments where local switch time represents the time of day at a switch. The timepoint fields are used by the network switches billing center and other network subsystems. Each subsystem however may require the time period for a different use and in a different format such as in an epoch time format. Epoch time is the number of one 1 second increments since a particular date and time in history. For example the billing center requires epoch time for its billing records whereas switch reports and error logs require local switch time.

A problem also arises when using only local switch time in that there is no accommodation for time changes due to daylight savings time. In addition each subsystem may require a finer granularity of precision than the current three 3 second increments. By providing only local switch time at three 3 second increments the switches have passed the burden of translating the time into a usable format to the network subsystems. The fixed record format cannot accommodate the various time period requirements because it only contains the time periods in local switch time at a low level of precision. Because of its fixed nature the fixed record format cannot expand to include different time formats nor to include a finer granularity of precision such as a one 1 second increment.

Therefore there is a need for switches of a telecommunications network to store call record information in a flexible and expandable format. There is a further need to provide time point fields with one 1 second granularity in a flexible format that easily and efficiently responds to daylight savings time and time zone changes.

There is also a need to match all of the call records associated with a specific telephone call. For example for proper billing and cost control it is necessary for the billing center to match the originating switch s call record to the terminating switch s call record. Also for troubleshooting and security purposes it may be necessary to trace a specific telephone call through the network with ease in order to isolate problem areas.

Therefore there is a need for switches of a telecommunications network to uniquely identify each telephone call that traverses the network thereby uniquely identifying all of the call records associated with a specific telephone call.

An embodiment solves the problem of providing a flexible and expandable call record format by implementing both a small and a large call record format. In particular the embodiment implements a default 32 word call record format plus an expanded 64 word call record format. An embodiment uses a 32 word call record format for the typical telephone call which comprises the majority of all telephone calls and uses a 64 word call record format when additional information is needed regarding the call. This implementation provides the flexibility needed to efficiently manage varying data requirements of a given call record. New call features can be developed and easily incorporated into the variable call record format of the present invention.

This embodiment also records timepoints in the epoch time format. The embodiment records the origination time of a call in epoch time format and the remaining timepoints are offsets or the number of seconds from that origination time. This embodiment solves the problems associated with converting to and from daylight savings time because daylight savings time is a local time offset and does not affect the epoch time. Furthermore the timepoints in epoch time format require less space in the call record than they do in local switch time format.

The epoch time format may represent coordinated universal time UTC as determined at Greenwich England which has a time zone of zero 0 local switch time or any other time. Epoch time is only a format and does not dictate that UTC must be used. The billing time and the local switch time may be in UTC or local time and the local switch time may not necessarily be the same time that is used for billing. Therefore the switch must keep billing time and local switch time separate in order to prevent the problems that occur during daylight savings time changes.

This embodiment solves the problem of uniquely identifying each telephone call and all of the call records associated with a specific telephone call by providing a unique identifier to each call record. It generates a network call identifier NCID that is assigned to each call record at the point of call origination that is the originating switch generates an NCID for each telephone call. The NCID accompanies the associated telephone call through the telecommunications network to the termination point at the terminating switch. Therefore at any point of a telephone call in the network the associated NCID identifies the point and time of origin of the telephone call. Each switch through which the telephone call passes records the NCID in the call record associated with the call. The NCID is small enough to fit in a 32 word call record thereby reducing the data throughput and storage. The NCID provides the billing center and other network subsystems with the ability to match originating and terminating call records for a specific telephone call.

This embodiment also provides the switch capability of discarding a received NCID and generating a new NCID. A switch discards a received NCID if the NCID format is invalid or unreliable thereby ensuring a valid unique identifier to be associated with each call going through the network. For instance an NCID may be unreliable if generated by third party switches in the telecommunications network.

This embodiment relates to switches of a telecommunication network that generate call records using a flexible and expandable record format. The call record formats include a small preferably 32 word and a large preferably 64 word expanded format. It would be readily apparent to one skilled in the relevant art to implement a small and large record format of different sizes.

The embodiment also relates to switches of a telecommunication network that generate a unique NCID for each telephone call traversing the network. The NCID provides a mechanism for matching all of the call records associated with a specific telephone call. It would be readily apparent to one skilled in the relevant art to implement a call record identifier of a different format.

The chosen embodiment is computer software executing within a computer system. shows an exemplary computer system. The computer system includes one or more processors such as a processor . The processor is connected to a communication bus .

The computer system also includes a main memory preferably random access memory RAM and a secondary memory . The secondary memory includes for example a hard disk drive and or a removable storage drive representing a floppy disk drive a magnetic tape drive a compact disk drive etc. The removable storage drive reads from and or writes to a removable storage unit in a well known manner.

Removable storage unit also called a program storage device or a computer program product represents a floppy disk magnetic tape compact disk etc. The removable storage unit includes a computer usable storage medium having therein stored computer software and or data.

Computer programs also called computer control logic are stored in main memory and or the secondary memory . Such computer programs when executed enable the computer system to perform the functions of the present invention as discussed herein. In particular the computer programs when executed enable the processor to perform the functions of the present invention. Accordingly such computer programs represent controllers of the computer system .

Another embodiment is directed to a computer program product comprising a computer readable medium having control logic computer software stored therein. The control logic when executed by the processor causes the processor to perform the functions as described herein.

Another embodiment is implemented primarily in hardware using for example a hardware state machine. Implementation of the hardware state machine so as to perform the functions described herein will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant arts.

This embodiment provides the switches of a telecommunication network with nine 9 different record formats. These records include Call Detail Record CDR Expanded Call Detail Record ECDR Private Network Record PNR Expanded Private Network Record EPNR Operator Service Record OSR Expanded Operator Service Record EOSR Private Operator Service Record POSR Expanded Private Operator Service Record EPOSR and Switch Event Record SER . Each record is 32 words in length and the expanded version of each record is 64 words in length.

Example embodiments of the nine 9 call record formats discussed herein are further described in . The embodiments of the call records of the present invention comprise both 32 word and 64 word call record formats. It would be apparent to one skilled in the relevant art to develop alternative embodiments for call records comprising a different number of words and different field definitions. shows a graphical representation of the CDR and PNR call record formats. show a graphical representation of the ECDR and EPNR call record formats. shows a graphical representation of the OSR and POSR call record format. show a graphical representation of the EOSR and EPOSR call record formats. shows a graphical representation of the SER record format.

The CDR and PNR and thereby the ECDR and EPNR are standard call record formats and contain information regarding a typical telephone call as it passes through a switch. The CDR is used for a non VNET customer whereas the PNR is used for a VNET customer and is generated at switches that originate VNET calls. The fields of these two records are identical except for some field specific information described below.

The OSR and POSR and thereby the EOSR and EPOSR contain information regarding a telephone call requiring operator assistance and are generated at switches or systems actually equipped with operator positions. A switch completes an OSR for a non VNET customer and completes a POSR for a private VNET customer. These records are only generated at switches or systems that have the capability of performing operator services or network audio response system NARS functions. The formats of the two 2 records are identical except for some field specific information described below. A SER is reserved for special events such as the passage of each hour mark time changes system recoveries and at the end of a billing block. The SER record format is also described in more detail below.

The first check determines if the call is involved in a direct termination overflow DTO at the current switch . For example a DTO occurs when a customer makes a telephone call to an 800 number and the original destination of the 800 number is busy. If the original destination is busy the switch overflows the telephone call to a new destination. In this case the switch must record the originally attempted destination the final destination of the telephone call and the number of times of overflow. Therefore if the call is involved in a DTO the switch must complete an expanded record ECDR EPNR EOSR EPOSR .

The second check made on a call by a switch determines if the calling location of the call is greater than ten 10 digits. The calling location is the telephone number of the location from where the call originated. Such an example is an international call which comprises at least eleven 11 digits. If the calling location is greater than ten 10 digits the switch records the telephone number of the calling location in an expanded record ECDR EPNR EOSR EPOSR .

A switch makes a third check on a call to determine if the destination address is greater than seventeen 17 digits. The destination address is the number of the called location and may be a telephone number or trunk group. If the destination is greater than seventeen 17 digits the switch records the destination in an expanded record ECDR EPNR EOSR EPOSR .

A switch makes a fourth check on a call to determine if the pre translated digits field is used with an operated assisted service call. The pre translated digits are the numbers of the call as dialed by a caller if the call must be translated to another number within the network. Therefore when a caller uses an operator service the switch records the dialed numbers in expanded record EOSR EPOSR .

In a fifth check on a call a switch determines if the pre translated digits of a call as dialed by a caller without operator assistance has more than ten 10 digits. If there are more than ten 10 pre translated digits the switch records the dialed numbers in expanded record ECDR EPNR .

In a sixth check on a call a switch determines if more than twenty two 22 digits including supplemental data are recorded in the Authorization Code field of the call record. The Authorization Code field indicates a party who gets billed for the call such as the calling location or a credit card call. If the data entry requires more than twenty two 22 digits the switch records the billing information in an expanded record ECDR EPNR EOSR EPOSR .

In a seventh check on a call a switch determines if the call is a wideband call. A wideband call is one that requires multiple transmission lines or channels. For example a typical video call requires six 6 transmission channels one 1 for voice and five 5 for the video transmission. The more transmission channels used during a wideband call results in a better quality of reception. Contemporary telecommunication systems currently provide up to twenty four 24 channels. Therefore to indicate which and how many of the twenty four channels is used during a wideband call the switch records the channel information in an expanded record ECDR EPNR .

In an eighth check on a call a switch determines if the time and charges feature was used by an operator. The time and charges feature is typically used in a hotel scenario when a hotel guest makes a telephone call using the operator s assistance and charges the call to her room. After the call has completed the operator informs the hotel guest of the charge or cost of the call . If the time and charges feature was used with a call the switch records the hotel guest s name and room number in an expanded record EOSR EPOSR .

The ninth and final check made on a call by a switch determines if the call is an enhanced voice service network audio response system EVS NARS call. An EVS NARS is an audio menu system in which a customer makes selections in response to an automated menu via her telephone key pad. Such a system includes a NARS switch on which the audio menu system resides. Therefore during an EVS NARS call the NARS switch records the customer s menu selections in an expanded record EOSR EPOSR .

If none of the checks return a positive result then the switch uses the default record format OSR POSR . Once the checks have been made on a call a switch generates and completes the appropriate call record. Call record data is recorded in binary and Telephone Binary Coded Decimal TBCD format. TBCD format is illustrated below 

All TBCD digit fields must be filled with TBCD Null or zero prior to data being recorded. Where applicable dialed digit formats conform to these conventions

Thus if the specification for a call record field contains a N the valid field values are the digits 2 9.

Each call record except SER contains call specific timepoint fields. The timepoint fields are recorded in epoch time format. Epoch time is the number of one second increments from a particular date time in history. The embodiment of the present invention uses a date time of midnight 00 00 am UTC on Jan. 1 1976 but this serves as an example and is not a limitation. It would be readily apparent to one skilled in the relevant art to implement an epoch time based on another date time. In the records Timepoint 1 represents the epoch time that is the origination time of the call . The other timepoint stored in the records are the number of seconds after Timepoint 1 that is they are offsets from Timepoint 1 that a particular timepoint occurred. All of the timepoint fields must be filled in with 0 s prior to any data being recorded. Therefore if a timepoint occurs its count is one 1 or greater. Additionally timepoint counters not including Timepoint 1 do not rollover their counts but stay at the maximum count if the time exceeds the limits.

The switch clock reflects local switch time and is used for all times except billing. Billing information is recorded in epoch time which in this embodiment is UTC. The Time offset is a number reflecting the switch time relative to the UTC that is the offset due to time zones and if appropriate daylight savings time changes. There are three factors to consider when evaluating time change relative to UTC. First there are time zones on both sides of UTC and therefore there may be both negative and positive offsets. Second the time zone offsets count down from zero in Greenwich England in an Eastward direction until the International Dateline is reached. At the Dateline the date changes to the next day such that the offset becomes positive and starts counting down until the zero offset is reached again at Greenwich. Third there are many areas of the world that have time zones that are not in exact one hour increments. For example Australia has one time zone that has a thirty 30 minute difference from the two time zones on either side of it and Northern India has a time zone that is fifteen 15 minutes after the one next to it. Therefore the Time Offset of the call records must account for variations in both negative and positive offsets in fifteen 15 minute increments. The embodiment of the present invention satisfies this requirement by providing a Time Offset representing either positive or negative one minute increments.

There are two formulas used to convert local switch time to epoch time and back. Epoch Time Sign Bit Time Offset Local Switch Time i Local Switch Time Sign Bit Time Offset Epoch Time ii 

The switch records the Time Offset in the SER using a value where one 1 equals one 1 minute and computes the Time Offset in seconds and adds this value to each local Timepoint 1 before the call record is recorded. For example Central Standard Time is six 6 hours before UTC. In this case the Sign Bit indicates 1 for negative offset and the Time Offset value recorded in the SER would be 360 6 hours 60 minutes hour 360 minutes . See for more details on the SER record format. When recording Timepoint 1 in the call record the switch multiplies the Time Offset by 60 because there is 60 seconds in each 1 minute increment and determines whether the offset is positive or negative by checking the Sign Bit. This example results in a value of 21 600 1 360 minutes 60 seconds minute 21 600 seconds . Using equation ii from above if the local switch time were midnight the corresponding epoch time might be for example 1 200 000 000. Subtracting the Time Offset of 21 600 results in a corrected epoch time of 1 200 021 600 seconds which is the epoch time for 6 hours after midnight on the next day in epoch time. This embodiment works equally as well in switches that are positioned on the East side of Greenwich where the Time Offset has a positive value.

Two commands are used when changing time. First illustrates the control flow of the Change Time command which changes the Local Switch Time and the Time Offset. In after a switch operator enters the Change Time command the switch enters step and prompts the switch operator for the Local Switch Time and Time Offset from UTC. In step the switch operator enters a new Local Switch Time and Time Offset. Continuing to step the new time and Time Offset are displayed back to the switch operator. Continuing to step the switch operator must verify the entered time and Time Offset before the actual time and offset are changed on the switch. If in step the switch operator verifies the changes the switch proceeds to step and generates a SER with an Event Qualifier equal to two which identifies that the change was made to the Local Switch Time and Time Offset of the switch. The billing center uses the SER for its bill processing. The switch proceeds to step and exits the command. Referring back to step if the switch operator does not verify the changes the switch proceeds to step and exits the command without updating the Local Switch Time and Time Offset. For more information on SER see .

In step the switch operator must verify the forward or backward option and the new Local Switch Time and Time Offset before the actual time change takes place. If in step the switch operator verifies the new time and Time Offset the switch proceeds to step and generates a SER with an Event Qualifier equal to nine which changes the Local Switch Time and Time Offset of the switch. The switch proceeds to step and exits the command. Referring back to step if the switch operator does not verify the changes the switch proceeds to step and exits the command without updating the Local Switch Time and Time Offset.

After the successful completion of a Change Daylight Savings Time Command the billing records are affected by the new Time Offset. This embodiment allows the epoch time used as the billing time to increment normally through the daylight savings time change procedure and not to be affected by the change of Local Switch Time and Time Offset.

An embodiment provides a unique NCID that is assigned to each telephone call that traverses through the telecommunications network. Thus the NCID is a discrete identifier among all network calls. The NCID is transported and recorded at each switch that is involved with the telephone call.

The originating switch of a telephone call generates the NCID. The chosen embodiment of the NCID of the present invention is an eighty two 82 bit identifier that is comprised of the following subfields 

i Originating Switch ID 14 bits This field represents the NCS Switch ID as defined in the Office Engineering table at each switch. The SER call record however contains an alpha numeric representation of the Switch ID. Thus a switch uses the alphanumeric Switch ID as an index into a database for retrieving the corresponding NCS Switch ID. ii Originating Trunk Group 14 bits This field represents the originating trunk group as defined in the 32 64 word call record format described above. iii Originating Port Number 19 bits This field represents the originating port number as defined in the 32 64 word call record format described above. iv Timepoint 1 32 bits This field represents the Timepoint 1 value as defined in the 32 64 word call record format described above. v Sequence Number 3 bits This field represents the number of calls which have occurred on the same port number with the same Timepoint 1 second value. The first telephone call will have a sequence number set to 0. This value increases incrementally for each successive call which originates on the same port number with the same Timepoint 1 value.

It would be readily apparent to one skilled in the relevant art to create an NCID of a different format. Each switch records the NCID in either the 32 or 64 word call record format. Regarding the 32 word call record format intermediate and terminating switches will record the NCID in the AuthCode field of the 32 word call record if the AuthCode filed is not used to record other information. In this case the Originating Switch ID is the NCS Switch ID not the alphanumeric Switch ID as recorded in the SER call record. If the AuthCode is used for other information the intermediate and terminating switches record the NCID in the 64 word call record format. In contrast originating switches do not use the AuthCode field when storing an NCID in a 32 word call record. Originating switches record the subfields of the NCID in the corresponding separate fields of the 32 word call record. That is the Originating Switch ID is stored as an alphanumeric Switch ID in the Switch ID field of the SER call record the Originating Trunk Group is stored in the Originating Trunk Group field of the 32 word call record the Originating Port Number is stored in the Originating Port field of the 32 word call record the Timepoint 1 is stored in the Timepoint 1 field of the 32 word call record the Sequence Number is stored in the NCID Sequence Number field of the 32 word call record. The 32 word call record also includes an NCID Location NCIDLOC field to identify when the NCID is recorded in the AuthCode field of the call record. If the NCID Location field contains a 1 then the AuthCode field contains the NCID. If the NCID Location field contains a 0 then the NCID is stored in its separate sub fields in the call record. Only intermediate and terminating switches set the NCID Location field to a 1 because originating switches store the NCID in the separate fields of the 32 word call record.

Regarding the 64 word call record format the expanded call record includes a separate field call the NCID field to store the 82 bits of the NCID. This call record is handled the same regardless of whether an originating intermediate or terminating switch stores the NCID. In the 64 word call record format the Originating Switch ID is the NCS Switch ID not the alphanumeric Switch ID as recorded in the SER call record.

In step the switch analyzes the originating trunk group parameters to determine the originating trunk group type. If the originating trunk group type is an InterMachine Trunk IMT or a release link trunk RLT then the switch proceeds to step . An IMT is a trunk connecting two normal telecommunication switches whereas a RLT is a trunk connecting an intelligent services network ISN platform to a normal telecommunication switch. When the current switch reaches step the current switch knows that it is not an originating switch and that it has not received an NCID. In step the current switch analyzes the originating trunk group parameters to determine whether it is authorized to create an NCID for the call . In step if the current switch is not authorized to create an NCID for the call the current switch proceeds to step . When in step the current switch knows that it is not an originating switch it did not receive an NCID for the call but is not authorized to generate an NCID. Therefore in step the current switch writes the call record associated with the call to the local switch database and proceeds to step . In step the current switch transports the call out through the network with its associated NCID. Step is described below in more detail.

Referring again to step if the current switch is authorized to create an NCID for the call the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch generates a new NCID for the call before continuing to step . In step the current switch writes the call record including the NCID associated with the call to the local switch database and proceeds to step . In step the current switch transports the call out through the network with its associated NCID. Step is described below in more detail.

Referring again to step if the current switch determines that the originating trunk group type is not an IMT or RLT the current switch proceeds to step . When reaching step the current switch knows that it is an originating switch and therefore must generate a NCID for the call . Step is described below in more detail. After generating a NCID in step the current switch proceeds to step to write the call record including the NCID associated with the call to the local database. After writing the call record the current switch proceeds to step to transport the call out through the network with its associated NCID. Step is also described below in more detail.

Referring again to step if the current switch determines that it received an NCID with the call the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch processes the received NCID. In step there are two possible results. First the current switch may decide not to keep the received NCID thereby proceeding from step to step to generate a new NCID. Step is described below in more detail. In step the current switch may generate a new NCID for the call before continuing to step . Step is also described below in more detail. In step the current switch writes the call record associated with the call to the local database. The current switch then proceeds to step and transports the call out through the network with its associated NCID. Step is also described below in more detail.

Referring again to step the current switch may decide to keep the received NCID thereby proceeding from step to step . In step the current switch adds the received NCID to the call record associated with the call . Steps and are described below in more detail. After step the current switch continues to step where it writes the call record associated with the call to the local database. The current switch then proceeds to step and transports the call out through the network with its associated NCID. Step is also described below in more detail.

Referring again to step if the originating trunk group type is not an IMT or RLT the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch determines if the originating trunk group type is an Integrated Services User Parts Direct Access Line ISUP DAL or an Integrated Services Digital Network Primary Rate Interface ISDN PRI . ISUP is a signaling protocol which allows information to be sent from switch to switch as information parameters. An ISUP DAL is a trunk group that primarily is shared by multiple customers of the network but can also be dedicated to a single network customer. In contrast an ISDN PRI is a trunk group that primarily is dedicated to a single network customer but can also be shared by multiple network customers. A network customer is an entity that leases network resources. In step if the current switch determines that the trunk group type is not an ISUP DAL or ISDN PRI the current switch proceeds to step . When in step the current switch knows that it received an NCID that was not generated by a switch that is part of the telecommunication network or by a switch that is a customer of the network. Therefore in step the current switch discards the received NCID because it is an unreliable NCID. From step the current switch exits step thereby continuing to step in where the current switch will create a new NCID and transport that NCID with the call .

Referring back to step if the current switch determines that the originating trunk group type is an ISUP DAL or ISDN PRI the current switch continues to step . When in step the current switch knows that it received an NCID from a customer trunk group. Therefore the current switch analyzes the originating trunk group parameters to determine whether it is authorized to create a new NCID for the call . The current switch may be authorized to create a new NCID and overwrite the NCID provided by the customer to ensure that a valid NCID corresponds to the call and is sent through the network. In step if the current switch is not authorized to create a new NCID for the call the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch checks the validity of the received NCID for example the NCID length. If the received NCID is invalid the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch discards the invalid NCID. From step the current switch exits step thereby continuing to step in where the current switch will create a new NCID and transport that NCID with the call .

Referring again to step if the current switch determines that the received NCID is valid the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch keeps the received NCID and exits step thereby continuing to step in where the current switch will store the received NCID in the call record and transport the call.

Referring again to step if the AuthCode field is not available in the 32 word call record the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch stores the NCID in the NCID field of the 64 word call record. After step the current switch exits step and continues to step in where the current switch writes the call record to the local switch database.

After transporting the call and the IAM the current switch proceeds to step thereby exiting the switch processing.

Referring again to step if the current switch is not authorized to deliver the NCID to the next switch in an IAM message the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch transports the call to the next switch under normal procedures which consists of sending an IAM message to the next switch without the NCID recorded as part of the generic digits parameter. After transporting the call the current switch proceeds to step thereby exiting the switch processing.

Referring again to step if the current switch determines that the terminating trunk is not an ISUP the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch determines if the terminating trunk group is an ISDN trunk the terminating trunk group is dedicated to one network customer .

If the terminating trunk group is an ISDN the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch analyzes the parameters associated with the ISDN trunk group type to determine whether or not to deliver the NCID to the next switch. If the current switch is authorized to deliver the NCID the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch transports the call to the next switch along with a setup message. The setup message contains setup information for the next switch which prepares the next switch to accept and complete the call . The NCID is transported as part of the locking shift codeset 6 parameter of the setup message. The format of the locking shift codeset 6 parameter is shown below in Table 41B 

After transporting the call and the setup message the current switch proceeds to step thereby exiting the switch processing.

Referring again to step if the current switch determines that it does not have authority to deliver the NCID to the next switch in a setup message the current switch proceeds to step . In step the current switch transports the call to the next switch under normal procedures which consists of sending a setup message to the next switch without the NCID recorded as part of the locking shift codeset 6 parameter. After transporting the call the current switch proceeds to step thereby exiting the switch processing.

Referring again to step this step is also entered from step on when the current switch did not receive an NCID is an intermediate or terminating switch and is not authorized to create an NCID. In this case in step the current switch also transports the call to the next switch under normal procedures which consists of sending an IAM or setup message to the next switch without the NCID recorded as part of the parameter. After transporting the call the current switch proceeds to step thereby exiting the switch processing.

A system and method for the switches of a telecommunications network to generate call records for telephone calls using a flexible and expandable record format. Upon receipt of a telephone call a switch in the network analyzes the telephone call to determine whether the default call record is sufficiently large to store call record information pertaining to the telephone call or whether the expanded call record must be used to store the call information pertaining to the telephone call. After determining which call record to use the switch generates the default or expanded call record. The switch sends a billing block comprised of completed call records to a billing center upon filling an entire billing block.

In today s telephony environment a caller must contact an operator to initiate a conference call and or have all parties dial a common number to connect into a conference call. This requires the cost of a human operator and the inconvenience of dialing a predefined number to be carried as overhead of each conference call. It also makes it very inefficient to schedule a conference call and assure that all parties are available to participate. It also requires a dedicated number for all the parties to access to facilitate the call.

In accordance with a preferred embodiment a callback system is facilitated by a caller accessing a display from a computer and filling out information describing the parameters of a call. Information such as the date and time the call should be initiated billing information and telephone numbers of parties to participate in the call could be captured. Then based on the information entered a central or distributed computing facility with access to the hybrid network transmits e mail in a note to each party required for the call copying the other parties to verify participation and calendar the event. The e mail would include any particulars such as the password associated with the call and time the call would be commenced. The necessary network facilities would also be reserved to assure the appropriate Quality of Service QOS would be available and when the date and time requested arrived the call is initiated by contacting each of the participants whether they be utilizing a telephone attached to a PSTN or a voice capable apparatus such as a computer or intelligent television attached to the hybrid network. At any time during scheduling initiation or duration of the call any party could request operator assistance by selecting that service from the display associated with the call. Thus a completely automated callback system is provided for call setup and control.

For callers that utilize the callback system on a regular basis a custom profile is provided as an extension to the users existing profile information. The custom profile allows a user to store frequent conference call participants information. The profile contains participant s telephone numbers which could be DDD IDDD IP Address or Cellular phone number E mail address paging service fax number secretary phone number location time zone working hours and other pertinent information that will be useful for initiating a call. Default profiles based on company or organization needs are also enabled and can be tailored to meet the needs of a particular user based on more global information.

Billing information would also be provided online. A user could enter a pre arranged billing number or the ability to bill to a credit card or telephone number. If billing to a telephone number the system treats the call like a collect or third party call to verify billing.

If profile information were predefined for a particular call scenario then another option would allow an immediate connection of a conference call or single call at the press of a button much as speed dialing is performed today except that more than one caller could be joined without intervention of the calling party Internet callers are supported and an operator can be joined as required.

Before describing this aspect of the present invention a description of internet environment is presented.

The Internet is a method of interconnecting physical networks and a set of conventions for using networks that allow the computers they reach to interact. Physically the Internet is a huge global network spanning over 92 countries and comprising 59 000 academic commercial government and military networks according to the Government Accounting Office GAO with these numbers expected to double each year. Furthermore there are about 10 million host computers 50 million users and 76 000 World Wide Web servers connected to the Internet. The backbone of the Internet consists of a series of high speed communication links between major supercomputer sites and educational and research institutions within the U.S. and throughout the world.

Protocols govern the behavior along the Internet backbone and thus set down the key rules for data communication. Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP has an open nature and is available to everyone meaning that it attempts to create a network protocol system that is independent of computer or network operating system and architectural differences. As such TCP IP protocols are publicly available in standards documents particularly in Requests for Comments RFCs . A requirement for Internet connection is TCP IP which consists of a large set of data communications protocols two of which are the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol.

The popularity of the TCP IP protocols on the Internet grew rapidly because they met an important need for worldwide data communication and had several important characteristics that allowed them to meet this need. These characteristics still in use today include 

A common addressing scheme that allows any device running TCP IP to uniquely address any other device on the Internet.

Open protocol standards freely available and developed independently of any hardware or operating system. Thus TCP IP is capable of being used with different hardware and software even if Internet communication is not required.

Independence from any specific physical network hardware allows TCP IP to integrate many different kinds of networks. TCP IP can be used over an Ethernet a token ring a dial up line or virtually any other kinds of physical transmission media.

An understanding of how information travels in communication systems is required to appreciate the recent steps taken by key players in today s Internet backbone business. The traditional type of communication network is circuit switched. The U.S. telephone system uses such circuit switching techniques. When a person or a computer makes a telephone call the switching equipment within the telephone system seeks out a physical path from the originating telephone to the receiver s telephone. A circuit switched network attempts to form a dedicated connection or circuit between these two points by first establishing a circuit from the originating phone through the local switching office then across trunk lines to a remote switching office and finally to the destination telephone. This dedicated connection exists until the call terminates.

The establishment of a completed path is a prerequisite to the transmission of data for circuit switched networks. After the circuit is in place the microphone captures analog signals and the signals are transmitted to the Local Exchange Carrier LEC Central Office CO in analog form over an analog loop. The analog signal is not converted to digital form until it reaches the LEC Co and even then only if the equipment is modern enough to support digital information. In an ISDN embodiment however the analog signals are converted to digital at the device and transmitted to the LEC as digital information.

Upon connection the circuit guarantees that the samples can be delivered and reproduced by maintaining a data path of 64 Kbps thousand bits per second . This rate is not the rate required to send digitized voice per se. Rather 64 Kbps is the rate required to send voice digitized with the Pulse Code Modulated PCM technique. Many other methods for digitizing voice exist including ADPCM 32 Kbps GSM 13 Kbps TrueSpeech 8.5 8.5 Kbps G.723 6.4 Kbps or 5.3 Kbps and Voxware RT29HQ 2.9 Kbps . Furthermore the 64 Kbps path is maintained from LEC Central Office CO Switch to LEC CO but not from end to end. The analog local loop transmits an analog signal not 64 Kbps digitized audio. One of these analog local loops typically exists as the last mile of each of the telephone network circuits to attach the local telephone of the calling party.

This guarantee of capacity is the strength of circuit switched networks. However circuit switching has two significant drawbacks. First the setup time can be considerable because the call signal request may find the lines busy with other calls in this event there is no way to gain connection until some other connection terminates. Second utilization can be low while costs are high. In other words the calling party is charged for the duration of the call and for all of the time even if no data transmission takes place i.e. no one speaks . Utilization can be low because the time between transmission of signals is unable to be used by any other calls due to the dedication of the line. Any such unused bandwidth during the connection is wasted.

Additionally the entire circuit switching infrastructure is built around 64 Kbps circuits. The infrastructure assumes the use of PCM encoding techniques for voice. However very high quality codecs are available that can encode voice using less than one tenth of the bandwidth of PCM. However the circuit switched network blindly allocates 64 Kbps of bandwidth for a call end to end even if only one tenth of the bandwidth is utilized. Furthermore each circuit generally only connects two parties. Without the assistance of conference bridging equipment an entire circuit to a phone is occupied in connecting one party to another party. Circuit switching has no multicast or multipoint communication capabilities except when used in combination with conference bridging equipment.

Other reasons for long call setup time include the different signaling networks involved in call setup and the sheer distance causing propagation delay. Analog signaling from an end station to a CO on a low bandwidth link can also delay call setup. Also the call setup data travels great distances on signaling networks that are not always transmitting data at the speed of light. When the calls are international the variations in signaling networks grows the equipment handling call setup is usually not as fast as modem setup and the distances are even greater so call setup slows down even more. Further in general connection oriented virtual or physical circuit setup such as circuit switching requires more time at connection setup time than comparable connectionless techniques due to the end to end handshaking required between the conversing parties.

Message switching is another switching strategy that has been considered. With this form of switching no physical path is established in advance between the sender and receiver instead whenever the sender has a block of data to be sent it is stored at the first switching office and retransmitted to the next switching point after error inspection. Message switching places no limit on block size thus requiring that switching stations must have disks to buffer long blocks of data also a single block may tie up a line for many minutes rendering message switching useless for interactive traffic.

Packet switched networks which predominate the computer network industry divide data into small pieces called packets that are multiplexed onto high capacity intermachine connections. A packet is a block of data with a strict upper limit on block size that carries with it sufficient identification necessary for delivery to its destination. Such packets usually contain several hundred bytes of data and occupy a given transmission line for only a few tens of milliseconds. Delivery of a larger file via packet switching requires that it be broken into many small packets and sent one at a time from one machine to the other. The network hardware delivers these packets to the specified destination where the software reassembles them into a single file.

Packet switching is used by virtually all computer interconnections because of its efficiency in data transmissions. Packet switched networks use bandwidth on a circuit as needed allowing other transmissions to pass through the lines in the interim. Furthermore throughput is increased by the fact that a router or switching office can quickly forward to the next stop any given packet or portion of a large file that it receives long before the other packets of the file have arrived. In message switching the intermediate router would have to wait until the entire block was delivered before forwarding. Today message switching is no longer used in computer networks because of the superiority of packet switching.

To better understand the Internet a comparison to the telephone system is helpful. The public switched telephone network was designed with the goal of transmitting human voice in a more or less recognizable form. Their suitability has been improved for computer to computer communications but remains far from optimal. A cable running between two computers can transfer data at speeds in the hundreds of megabits and even gigabits per second. A poor error rate at these speeds would be only one error per day. In contrast a dial up line using standard telephone lines has a maximum data rate in the thousands of bits per second and a much higher error rate. In fact the combined bit rate times error rate performance of a local cable could be 11 orders of magnitude better than a voice grade telephone line. New technology however has been improving the performance of these lines.

The Internet is composed of a great number of individual networks together forming a global connection of thousands of computer systems. After understanding that machines are connected to the individual networks we can investigate how the networks are connected together to form an internetwork or an internet. At this point internet gateways and internet routers come into play.

In terms of architecture two given networks are connected by a computer that attaches to both of them. Internet gateways and routers provide those links necessary to send packets between networks and thus make connections possible. Without these links data communication through the Internet would not be possible as the information either would not reach its destination or would be incomprehensible upon arrival. A gateway may be thought of as an entrance to a communications network that performs code and protocol conversion between two otherwise incompatible networks. For instance gateways transfer electronic mail and data files between networks over the internet.

IP Routers are also computers that connect networks and is a newer term preferred by vendors. These routers must make decisions as to how to send the data packets it receives to its destination through the use of continually updated routing tables. By analyzing the destination network address of the packets routers make these decisions. Importantly a router does not generally need to decide which host or end user will receive a packet instead a router seeks only the destination network and thus keeps track of information sufficient to get to the appropriate network not necessarily the appropriate end user. Therefore routers do not need to be huge supercomputing systems and are often just machines with small main memories and little disk storage. The distinction between gateways and routers is slight and current usage blurs the line to the extent that the two terms are often used interchangeably. In current terminology a gateway moves data between different protocols and a router moves data between different networks. So a system that moves mail between TCP IP and OSI is a gateway but a traditional IP gateway that connects different networks is a router.

Now it is useful to take a simplified look at routing in traditional telephone systems. The telephone system is organized as a highly redundant multilevel hierarchy. Each telephone has two copper wires coming out of it that go directly to the telephone company s nearest end office also called a local central office. The distance is typically less than 10 km in the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 000 end offices. The concatenation of the area code and the first three digits of the telephone number uniquely specify an end office and help dictate the rate and billing structure.

The two wire connections between each subscriber s telephone and the end office are called local loops. If a subscriber attached to a given end office calls another subscriber attached to the same end office the switching mechanism within the office sets up a direct electrical connection between the two local loops. This connection remains intact for the duration of the call due to the circuit switching techniques discussed earlier.

If the subscriber attached to a given end office calls a user attached to a different end office more work has to be done in the routing of the call. First each end office has a number of outgoing lines to one or more nearby switching centers called toll offices. These lines are called toll connecting trunks. If both the caller s and the receiver s end offices happen to have a toll connecting trunk to the same toll office the connection may be established within the toll office. If the caller and the recipient of the call do not share a toll office then the path will have to be established somewhere higher up in the hierarchy. There are sectional and regional offices that form a network by which the toll offices are connected. The toll sectional and regional exchanges communicate with each other via high bandwidth inter toll trunks. The number of different kinds of switching centers and their specific topology varies from country to country depending on its telephone density.

In addition to the data transfer functionality of the Internet TCP IP also seeks to convince users that the Internet is a solitary virtual network. TCP IP accomplishes this by providing a universal interconnection among machines independent of the specific networks to which hosts and end users attach. Besides router interconnection of physical networks software is required on each host to allow application programs to use the Internet as if it were a single real physical network.

The basis of Internet service is an underlying connectionless packet delivery system run by routers with the basic unit of transfer being the packet. In internets running TCP IP such as the Internet backbone these packets are called datagrams. This section will briefly discuss how these datagrams are routed through the Internet.

In packet switching systems routing is the process of choosing a path over which to send packets. As mentioned before routers are the computers that make such choices. For the routing of information from one host within a network to another host on the same network the datagrams that are sent do not actually reach the Internet backbone. This is an example of internal routing which is completely self contained within the network. The machines outside of the network do not participate in these internal routing decisions.

At this stage a distinction should be made between direct delivery and indirect delivery. Direct delivery is the transmission of a datagram from one machine across a single physical network to another machine on the same physical network. Such deliveries do not involve routers. Instead the sender encapsulates the datagram in a physical frame addresses it and then sends the frame directly to the destination machine.

Indirect delivery is necessary when more than one physical network is involved in particular when a machine on one network wishes to communicate with a machine on another network. This type of communication is what we think of when we speak of routing information across the Internet backbone. In indirect delivery routers are required. To send a datagram the sender must identify a router to which the datagram can be sent and the router then forwards the datagram towards the destination network. Recall that routers generally do not keep track of the individual host addresses of which there are millions but rather just keeps track of physical networks of which there are thousands .

Essentially routers in the Internet form a cooperative interconnected structure and datagrams pass from router to router across the backbone until they reach a router that can deliver the datagram directly.

The changing face of the internet world causes a steady inflow of new systems and technology. The following three developments each likely to become more prevalent in the near future serve as an introduction to the technological arena.

Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM is a networking technology using a high speed connection oriented system for both local area and wide area networks. ATM networks require modern hardware including 

High speed switches that can operate at gigabit trillion bit per second speeds to handle the traffic from many computers.

Optical fibers versus copper wires that provide high data transfer rates with host to ATM switch connections running at 100 or 155 Mbps million bits per second .

ATM incorporates features of both packet switching and circuit switching as it is designed to carry voice video and television signals in addition to data. Pure packet switching technology is not conducive to carrying voice transmissions because such transfers demand more stable bandwidth.

Frame relay systems use packet switching techniques but are more efficient than traditional systems. This efficiency is partly due to the fact that they perform less error checking than traditional X.25 packet switching services. In fact many intermediate nodes do little or no error checking at all and only deal with routing leaving the error checking to the higher layers of the system. With the greater reliability of today s transmissions much of the error checking previously performed has become unnecessary. Thus frame relay offers increased performance compared to traditional systems.

An Integrated Services Digital Network is an international telecommunications standard for transmitting voice video and data over digital lines most commonly running at 64 kilobits per second. The traditional phone network runs voice at only 4 kilobits per second. To adopt ISDN an end user or company must upgrade to ISDN terminal equipment central office hardware and central office software. The ostensible goals of ISDN include the following 

An ISP is composed of several disparate systems. As ISP integration proceeds formerly independent systems now become part of one larger whole with concomitant increases in the level of analysis testing scheduling and training in all disciplines of the ISP.

Real time view of the status of each conference call participant ANI and an alphanumeric representation to identify each participant entered by the initiator when a call is reserved can be displayed on screen as participants connect to conference. This information is captured as part of the call record set forth earlier and detailed in the appendix.

In an alternative embodiment a conference call without callback leg is enabled. In this embodiment a callback customer participates through a Voice Over Network VON application utilizing a computer with voice capability and can initiate a video screen popup on the computer display for manual operator assistance as detailed above in the description of a video operator.

An expert system monitors each call in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The system includes rules that define what logic to execute when an exception occurs. The rules include specialized processing based on whether the call is routed via a PSTN or the internet. In addition the system includes a default connection to a manual operator if no other correction of the connection is available. For example if a caller hangs up during a teleconference and other callers are still connected an exception message is sent to each of the still connected callers informing them of the status change. Another aspect of the expert system is to ensure quality of service QOS and produce reports indicating both integrity and exceptions. Scheduling of resources is tied to this expert system which regulates whether calls can be scheduled based on available or projected resources at the time of the proposed call. For example since all calls used by this system are initiated by the callback switch if there are insufficient outgoing trunk ports during the period of time that a callback subscriber requests then the callback subscriber is prompted to select another time or denied access to the resources for that time. This is utilized to predict when additional ports and or resources are required.

The NGN operations architecture specifies the points of insertion and collections for network wide events that feed the Fault Management systems. Since the components of the packet portion of the hybrid NGN infrastructure are in most cases manageable by SNMP or some other standard management protocol the major challenges are the following 

1. Correlation of the events from the packet infrastructure with the Core circuit based network events to provide the operators with a seamless service oriented view of the overall health of the network 

3. Mediation and standardization of the network messages to aid processing by the network management framework of the NGN.

The network management components of the NGN provide comprehensive solutions to address these challenges. Correlation is provided by the use of rules based inference engines. Event gathering and interpretation is typically performed by custom development of software interfaces which communicate directly with the network elements process raw events and sort them by context prior to storing them. For example alarms versus command responses. The mediation and standardization challenge is addressed by using a comprehensive library of all possible message types and network events categorize the numerous messages that the NGN generates.

In a circuit switched event gathering step an event is obtained from a circuit switched based network element. As discussed above event gathering and interpretation is typically performed by custom developed software interfaces which communicate directly with the network elements process raw network events and sort the events by context prior to storing them. After obtaining the events the events are correlated in a correlation step .

In a correlation step the event gathered in step is correlated with a second event obtained from a packet switched network element. As with circuit switched network elements packet switched event gathering and interpretation is typically performed by custom developed software interfaces which communicate directly with the network elements process raw network events and sort the events by context prior to storing them. As discussed above the correlation is preferably provided by a rules based inference engine. After the events are correlated a fault message is created in a fault message step .

In a fault message step a fault message is created based on the correlated first and second events obtained in steps and . Preferably the fault message is created utilizing a comprehensive library of all possible message types and network events which categorizes the numerous messages that the hybrid network generates.

The Proactive Threshold Manager is an automated network manager that forewarns service providers of a chance that a service level agreement to maintain a certain level of service is in danger of being breached.

The Proactive Threshold Manager provides real time threshold analysis that is it continuously monitors for plan thresholds that have been exceeded using algorithms. It receives call detail records from the Server and returns alarms which may be retrieved and examined using an NGN workstation. The threshold manager resides on an NGN hybrid network computer.

A threshold generally is a number which when exceeded generates an alarm in the Proactive Threshold Manager indicating possible breach of a service level agreement. Thresholds may be specified for the time of day and or the day of the week. Furthermore a threshold may be applied to each category for which the Proactive threshold manager keeps counts including the number of short duration calls long duration calls and cumulative minutes.

When an alarm is generated by the Proactive Threshold Manager it is also prioritized. The priority is a multiple of the number of times a threshold has been exceeded. For example if the threshold was 10 and the relevant count has reached 50 then the priority of the alarm is 5 50.div.10 .

Each alarm is available to an NGN hybrid network analyst via an NGN Workstation. The workstation is a PC with access to a Server and retrieves the next available alarm of the highest priority. The analyst investigates the alarm data and if a service level agreement breach is suspected notifies the provider and suggests appropriate actions to stop the breach.

In a minimum level determination step the Proactive Threshold Manager determines the minimum level of service needed to avoid breaching subscriber service level agreements. Service level agreement information is generally provided to the Proactive Threshold Manager by the rules database which contains most pertinent subscriber information.

In a sensing step the Proactive Threshold Manager senses the current level of service which is being provided to customers. Protocol converters assist the Proactive Threshold Manager in communicating with various components of the system. Protocol converters are able to translate information between the packet switched an circuit switched system components thus allowing the Proactive Threshold Manager to communicate with all the components of the hybrid system.

In a comparing step the Proactive Threshold Manager compares the current level of service sensed in step with the minimum level of service determined in step to determine where the current level of service is in relation to the minimum level service which needs to be provided to subscribers.

In an alarm step the Proactive Threshold Manager provides an indication or alarm to the service provider if the current level of service is within a predetermined range with respect to the minimum level of service. The threshold is preferably chosen such that the service provider is allowed enough time to cure the service level problem before the minimum service level is reached and the subscriber s service level agreement breached.

In an event processing step events generated in step are filtered aggregated and correlated by an element manager. The element manager is where the primary data reduction functions reside. The element manager filters aggregates and correlates the events to further isolate problems within the network. Any information that is deemed critical to monitor and manage the network is translated into standard object format in a translation step .

In a translation step information from step that is deemed critical to monitor and manage the network is translated into a standard object format. Generally typical operational events are only logged and not translated into standard object format. However critical information such as hardware failure is translated and forwarded to the Information Services Manager in an information provisioning step .

In an information provisioning step information from step is received by the Information Services Manager and forwarded to the Proactive Threshold Manager. The Information Services Manager provides the data management and data communications between the element manager and other system components. Generally the Information Services Manager adheres to CORBA standards to provide universal information access by an object request broker. The object request broker allows the Information Services Manager to share management information stored in distributed databases. The Proactive Threshold Manager uses the information provided by the Information Services Manger to determine a current level of service and compare the current level of services with the minimum level of service that the service provider can provide without violating SLAs.

As discussed above the element manager works with the Information Services Manager and the Presentation Manager to assist in the management of the hybrid network system. The three components are briefly described below to provide context for the detailed discussion of the element manager that follows.

The element manager communicates with the network elements to receive alarms and alerts through trapping and polling techniques. The element manager is the layer where the primary data reduction functions reside. At this layer events received at the element manager will be filtered aggregated and correlated to further isolate problems within the network. Information that is deemed critical to monitor and manage the network is translated into a standard object format and forwarded to the Information Services Manager. An element manager can be but is not necessarily software which adheres to open standards such as the Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP and the Object Management Group s OMG Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA .

The information services manager provides the data management and data communications between element managers and presentation managers. All information forwarded from the element managers is utilized by the information services manager to provide information to the network operators. The information services manager adheres to CORBA standards to provide ubiquitous information access via an object request broker ORB . The ORB allows the information services manager to share management information stored in distributed databases. The information services manager stores critical management information into operational real time and analytical historical distributed databases. These databases provide common data storage so that new products can be easily inserted into the management environment. For example if an event is received at an element manager that is deemed critical to display to a network user the information services manager will store a copy of the alarm in the operational database and then forward the alarm to the appropriate network operator.

Media and textual databases are also provided by the information services manager. The databases includes online manuals for administrative purposes as well as for the maintenance specialists to access element specific information. The databases also provide procedures policies and computer based training to network users. The information services manager provides requested information real time and historical to the network users via the presentation manager.

The presentation manager performs the function its name implies the presentation of the information to an end user. Because different locations and job functions require access to different types of information there are at least two types of display methods. The first is for graphic intensive presentations and the second is for nomadic use such as field technicians. The first environment requires a graphic intensive display such as those provided by X Windows MOTIF. The second environment is potentially bandwidth poor where dial up or wireless access may be used along with more traditional LAN access. This is also where browser technology is employed.

The Element Management Aspect of the present invention works in conjunction with other components of the system such as Fault Management to provide communication between the various network elements of the system.

In an event receiving step the Element Manager receives events from various network elements. Preferably the events are provided by custom software interfaces which communicate directly with network elements. The software interfaces preferably process the raw network events and sort them by context prior to providing the events to the Element Manager.

In a filtering and correlating step the Element Manager filters and correlates the events received in step . Preferably the correlation is provided by a rules based inference engine. After collecting and correlating the events the Element Manager performs a translation step . In step the events correlated in step are translated into standard object format. Generally a comprehensive library of all message types generated by the hybrid system is utilized to translate the correlated events into standard object format. Once the events are translated they are ready for use by other system components such as Fault Management or Billing.

The organization model for customer service support in the NGN network provides a single point of contact that is customer focused. This single point of contact provides technical expertise in resolving customer incidents troubles and requests. Generally a three tiered support structure is greatly increases customer satisfaction in service needs. Each tier or level possess an increased level of skill with tasks and responsibilities distributed accordingly.

In the Second Tier step the customer is provided access to technical experts and field support personnel who may specialize in specific areas. The greater specialized nature of this group allows it to solve many problems the group in step could not solve. This group is generally responsible for solving 30 40 of all hybrid network problems. If the customers network problem is solved at this stage the process ends. However if the customers network problem is not solved at this stage the process continues to a Third Tier step .

In the Third Tier step the customer is provided access to solution experts who are often hardware vendors software vendors or customer application development and maintenance teems. Customer network problems that get this far in the customer support process need individuals possessing in depth skills to investigate and resolve the difficult problems with there area of expertise. Solution experts are the last resort for solving the most difficult problems. Typically this group solves about 5 of all hybrid network problems.

The above model is generally referred to as the Skilled Model because personnel at all three tiers are highly skilled. This model generally creates a high percentage of calls resolved on the first call. Other approaches include a Functional Model and a Bypass Model. In the Functional Model users are requested to contact different areas depending on the nature of the incident. Calls are routed to the customer support representative best able to handle the call. This model can easily be coupled with the Skill Model above. In the Bypass Model First Tier only logs calls they do not resolve calls. One advantage of this model is that skilled resources don t have to waste time logging calls.

In more detail a customer calling a customer support center in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is first asked a series of questions by an interactive voice response IVR system or an live operator. The customer uses Touch Tone keys on the telephone to respond to these queries from the IVR or responds normally to a live operator.

When a product support engineer becomes available the previously gathered information both from the IVR query responses and the diagnostic information solicited from the system problem handlers and element managers is available to the product support engineer.

After reviewing the situation with the customer the product support engineer can query the customer s computer via support agents for additional information if necessary.

In systems according to the preferred embodiment the customer spends less time interacting with a product support engineer and is relieved of many of the responsibilities in diagnosing and resolving problems. Automated diagnoses and shorter customer interactions save the product support center time resources and money. At the same time the customer receives a better diagnosis and resolution of the problem than could usually be achieved with prior art product support techniques.

In addition one embodiment of the present invention makes the Internet a viable alternative to telephone calls as a tool for providing consumer product support. Many on line computer services such as Prodigy and America On Line provide for a fee as a part of their on line service software for connecting to and accessing the Internet.

The Internet access software accesses and handshakes with an Internet Entry Server which verifies the PIN number provides the access and times the user s access time. The Internet Entry Server is programmed to recognize the PIN number as entitling the user to a limited prepaid or free Internet access time for on line help services. Such a time period could be for a total time period such as 1 hour or more or access to on line help services can be unlimited for 90 days 6 months etc. for example with the access time paid for by the sponsor vendor. The first time a customer uses the on line help service the Internet Entry Server performs a registration process which includes a number of personal questions and custom data gathering in the form of queries provided by the sponsor vendor for response by the user.

The pertinent answers are then immediately provided to the sponsor vendor. The Internet Entry Server then hot links the customer to the sponsor vendor s Internet domain or Home Page for a mandatory guided tour where the user is exposed to any current product promotion by the sponsor vendor and can download promotional coupons product information etc. After this mandatory guided tour is completed the customer is allowed to enter queries for help in installing or using the sponsor vendor s product. As an optional promotional service upon termination of the on line help session access to other information on the Internet can be provided. Once the free on line help service time or time period is up the Internet Entry Server prompts the user with one or more of a plurality of options for extending the availability of on line help. For example the user can be prompted to enter a credit card number to which on line help charges can be charged he or she can be given the opportunity to answer additional survey information in return for additional free on line help or a 900 subscriber paid telephone access number can be provided through which additional on line help will be billed via the normal telephone company 900 billing cycles.

One embodiment of the present invention allows a user of a web application to communicate in an audio fashion in band without having to pick up another telephone. Users can click a button and go to a call center through a hybrid network using IP telephony. The system invokes an IP telephony session simultaneously with the data session and uses an active directory lookup whenever a person uses the system.

In a telephony step the present invention allows users to initiate and continue telephonic communication. The telephonic is routed by a user action in step when a user selects a phone number to call. Telephone numbers are typically included in a telephone directory accessible on screen by the user. In addition the directory may include icons which provide a highly recognizable visual mnemonic to allow users to easily recall the information included in a particular directory entry. The present invention utilizes the routing information to direct the call. Since both the original data from the data session and the new IP telephony data use Internet protocol the present invention can provide a seamless integration of the two to provide virtually simultaneous telephonic and non telephonic data communication. The availability of packet switching elements in the hybrid network facilitate this process.

In packet switching networks packets in the form of units of data are transmitted from a source such as a user terminal computer application program within a computer or other data handling or data communication device to a destination which may be simply another data handling or data communication device of the same character. The devices themselves typically are referred to as users in the context of the network. Blocks or frames of data are transmitted over a link along a path between nodes of the network. Each block consists of a packet together with control information in the form of a header and a trailer which are added to the packet as it exits the respective node. The header typically contains in addition to the destination address field a number of subfields such as operation code source address sequence number and length code. The trailer is typically a technique for generating redundancy checks such as a cyclic redundancy code for detecting errors. At the other end of the link the receiving node strips off the control information performs the required synchronization and error detection and reinserts the control information onto the departing packet.

Packet switching arose in part to fulfill the need for low cost data communications in networks developed to allow access to host computers. Special purpose computers designated as communication processors have been developed to offload the communication handling tasks which were formerly required of the host. The communication processor is adapted to interface with the host and to route packets along the network consequently such a processor is often simply called a packet switch. Data concentrators have also been developed to interface with hosts and to route packets along the network. In essence data concentrators serve to switch a number of lightly used links onto a smaller number of more heavily used links. They are often used in conjunction with and ahead of the packet switch.

In virtual circuit VC or connection oriented transmission packet switched data transmission is accomplished via predetermined end to end paths through the network in which user packets associated with a great number of users share link and switch facilities as the packets travel over the network. The packets may require storage at nodes between transmission links of the network until they may be forwarded along the respective outgoing link for the overall path. In connectionless transmission another mode of packet switched data transmission no initial connection is required for a data path through the network. In this mode individual datagrams carrying a destination address are routed through the network from source to destination via intermediate nodes and do not necessarily arrive in the order in which they were transmitted.

In a lookup step the telephonic communication over the hybrid network is limited bases on a user profile. Preferably the user profile is included in a rules database. By locating the user profile within the rules database the rules database can provide seamless cross location registration without the need for duplicate databases located on different networks. Using a rules database a user utilizing the Internet in Europe can get the same telephony service as provided in the United States as described above. Preferably the computer used to interface with the Internet includes multimedia equipment such as speakers and a microphone. Utilizing a multimedia equipped computer allows a user to use telephonic communication with little or no disruption while interfacing with the Internet. Multimedia computer speakers are used to receive the telephony audio from the network and the microphone is used to transmit the telephony data to the network.

The present invention includes data mining capability that provides the capability to analyze network management data looking for patterns and correlations across multiple dimensions. The system also constructs models of the behavior of the data in order to predict future growth or problems and facilitate managing the network in a proactive yet cost effective manner.

A technique called data mining allows a user to search large databases and to discover hidden patterns in that data. Data mining is thus the efficient discovery of valuable non obvious information from a large collection of data and centers on the automated discovery of new facts and underlying relationships in the data. The term data mining comes from the idea that the raw material is the business data and the data mining algorithm is the excavator shifting through the vast quantities of raw data looking for the valuable nuggets of business information.

Because data can be stored in such a wide variety of formats and because the data values can have such a wide variety of meanings data mining applications have in the past been written to perform specific data mining operations and there has been little or no reuse of code between application programs. Thus each data mining application is written from scratch making the development process long and expensive. Although the nuggets of business information that a data mining application discovers can be quite valuable they are of little use if they are expensive and untimely discovered. Returning to the mining analogy even if gold is selling for 900 per ounce nobody is interested in operating a gold mine if it takes two years and 901 per ounce to get it out of the ground.

Accurate forecasting relies heavily upon the ability to analyze large amounts of data. This task is extremely difficult because of the sheer quantity of data involved and the complexity of the analyses that must be performed. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that the data often resides in multiple databases each database having different internal file structures.

Rarely is the relevant information explicitly stored in the databases. Rather the important information exists only in the hidden relationships among items in the databases. Recently artificial intelligence techniques have been employed to assist users in discovering these relationships and in some cases in automatically discovering the relationships.

In a model building step the system builds a model of the network behavior based on the patterns and correlations identified in step . Data mining is a process that uses specific techniques to find patterns in data allowing a user to conduct a relatively broad search of large databases for relevant information that may not be explicitly stored in the databases. Typically a user initially specifies a search phrase or strategy and the system then extracts patterns and relations corresponding to that strategy from the stored data. Such a search system permits searching across multiple databases. The extracted patterns and relations can be 1 used by the user or data analyst to form a prediction model 2 used to refine an existing model and or 3 organized into a summary of the target database as in predicting step .

In a predicting step the system predicts future behavior of the network based on the model generated in step . There are two existing forms of data mining top down and bottom up. Both forms are separately available on existing systems. Top down systems are also referred to as pattern validation verification driven data mining and confirmatory analysis. This is a type of analysis that allows an analyst to express a piece of knowledge validate or validate that knowledge and obtain the reasons for the validation or invalidation. The validation step in a top down analysis requires that data refuting the knowledge as well as data supporting the knowledge be considered. Bottom up systems are also referred to as data exploration. Bottom up systems discover knowledge generally in the form of patterns in data.

Finally in a managing step the network is managed based on the future behavior of the network. Data mining involves the development of tools that analyze large databases to extract useful information from them. As an application of data mining customer purchasing patterns may be derived from a large customer transaction database by analyzing its transaction records. Such purchasing habits can provide invaluable marketing information. For example retailers can create more effective store displays and more effective control inventory than otherwise would be possible if they know consumer purchase patterns. As a further example catalog companies can conduct more effective mass mailings if they know that given that a consumer has purchased a first item the same consumer can be expected with some degree of probability to purchase a particular second item within a defined time period after the first purchase.

Classification of the data records to extract useful information is an essential part of data mining. Of importance to the present invention is the construction of a classifier from records of known classes for use in classifying other records whose classes are unknown. As generally known in the prior art a classifier is generated from input data also called a training set which consist of multiple records. Each record is identified with a class label. The input data is analyzed to develop an accurate description or model for each class of the records. Based on the class descriptions the classifier can then classify future records referred to as test data for which the class labels are unknown.

As an example consider the case where a credit card company which has a large database on its card holders and wants to develop a profile for each customer class that will be used for accepting or rejecting future credit applicants. Assuming that the card holders have been divided into two classes good and bad customers based on their credit history. The problem can be solved using classification. First a training set consisting of customer data with the assigned classes are provided to a classifier as input. The output from the classifier is a description of each class i.e. good and bad which then can be used to process future credit card applicants. Similar applications of classification are also found in other fields such as target marketing medical diagnosis treatment effectiveness and store location search.

In data mining applications of classification very large training sets such as those having several million examples are common. Thus it is critical in these applications to have a classifier that scales well and can handle training data of this magnitude. As an additional advantage being able to classify large training data also leads to an improvement in the classification accuracy.

Another desirable characteristic for a data mining classifier is its short training time i.e. the ability to construct the class descriptions from the training set quickly. As a result the methods of the invention are based on a decision tree classifier. Decision trees are highly developed techniques for partitioning data samples into a set of covering decision rules. They are compact and have the additional advantage that they can be converted into simple classification rules.

In addition they can be easily converted into Structured Query language SQL statements used for accessing databases and achieve comparable or better classification accuracy than other classification methods.

Another data mining classifier technique solves the memory constraint problem and simultaneously improve execution time by partitioning the data into subsets that fit in the memory and developing classifiers for the subsets in parallel. The output of the classifiers are then combined using various algorithms to obtain the final classification. This approach reduces running time significantly. Another method classifies data in batches.

The present invention provides a new kind of web architecture framework called WAF in this document that secures administers and audits electronic information use. WAF also features fundamentally important capabilities for managing content that travels across the information highway. These capabilities comprise a rights protection solution that serves all electronic community members. These members include content creators and distributors financial service providers end users and others. WAF is the first general purpose configurable transaction control rights protection solution for users of computers other electronic appliances networks and the information highway.

The Internet is a method of interconnecting physical networks and a set of conventions for using networks that allow the computers they reach to interact. Physically the Internet is a huge global network spanning over 92 countries and comprising 59 000 academic commercial government and military networks according to the Government Accounting Office GAO with these numbers expected to double each year. Furthermore there are about 10 million host computers 50 million users and 76 000 World Wide Web servers connected to the Internet. The backbone of the Internet consists of a series of high speed communication links between major supercomputer sites and educational and research institutions within the U.S. and throughout the world.

Protocols govern the behavior along the Internet backbone and thus set down the key rules for data communication. Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP has an open nature and is available to everyone meaning that it attempts to create a network protocol system that is independent of computer or network operating system and architectural differences. As such TCP IP protocols are publicly available in standards documents particularly in Requests for Comments RFCs . A requirement for Internet connection is TCP IP which consists of a large set of data communications protocols two of which are the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol.

The popularity of the TCP IP protocols on the Internet grew rapidly because they met an important need for worldwide data communication and had several important characteristics that allowed them to meet this need. These characteristics still in use today include 

Independence from any specific physical network hardware allows TCP IP to integrate many different kinds of networks. TCP IP can be used over an Ethernet a token ring a dial up line or virtually any other kinds of physical transmission media.

An understanding of how information travels in communication systems is required to appreciate the recent steps taken by key players in today s Internet backbone business. The traditional type of communication network is circuit switched. The U.S. telephone system uses such circuit switching techniques.

When a person or a computer makes a telephone call the switching equipment within the telephone system seeks out a physical path from the originating telephone to the receiver s telephone. A circuit switched network attempts to form a dedicated connection or circuit between these two points by first establishing a circuit from the originating phone through the local switching office then across trunk lines to a remote switching office and finally to the destination telephone. This dedicated connection exists until the call terminates.

The establishment of a completed path is a prerequisite to the transmission of data for circuit switched networks. After the circuit is in place the microphone captures analog signals and the signals are transmitted to the Local Exchange Carrier LEC Central Office CO in analog form over an analog loop. The analog signal is not converted to digital form until it reaches the LEC Co and even then only if the equipment is modern enough to support digital information. In an ISDN embodiment however the analog signals are converted to digital at the device and transmitted to the LEC as digital information.

Upon connection the circuit guarantees that the samples can be delivered and reproduced by maintaining a data path of 64 Kbps thousand bits per second . This rate is not the rate required to send digitized voice per se. Rather 64 Kbps is the rate required to send voice digitized with the Pulse Code Modulated PCM technique. Many other methods for digitizing voice exist including ADPCM 32 Kbps GSM 13 Kbps TrueSpeech 8.5 8.5 Kbps G.723 6.4 Kbps or 5.3 Kbps and Voxware RT29HQ 2.9 Kbps . Furthermore the 64 Kbps path is maintained from LEC Central Office CO Switch to LEC CO but not from end to end. The analog local loop transmits an analog signal not 64 Kbps digitized audio. One of these analog local loops typically exists as the last mile of each of the telephone network circuits to attach the local telephone of the calling party.

This guarantee of capacity is the strength of circuit switched networks. However circuit switching has two significant drawbacks. First the setup time can be considerable because the call signal request may find the lines busy with other calls in this event there is no way to gain connection until some other connection terminates. Second utilization can be low while costs are high. In other words the calling party is charged for the duration of the call and for all of the time even if no data transmission takes place i.e. no one speaks . Utilization can be low because the time between transmission of signals is unable to be used by any other calls due to the dedication of the line. Any such unused bandwidth during the connection is wasted.

Additionally the entire circuit switching infrastructure is built around 64 Kbps circuits. The infrastructure assumes the use of PCM encoding techniques for voice. However very high quality codecs are available that can encode voice using less than one tenth of the bandwidth of PCM. However the circuit switched network blindly allocates 64 Kbps of bandwidth for a call end to end even if only one tenth of the bandwidth is utilized. Furthermore each circuit generally only connects two parties. Without the assistance of conference bridging equipment an entire circuit to a phone is occupied in connecting one party to another party. Circuit switching has no multicast or multipoint communication capabilities except when used in combination with conference bridging equipment.

Other reasons for long call setup time include the different signaling networks involved in call setup and the sheer distance causing propagation delay. Analog signaling from an end station to a CO on a low bandwidth link can also delay call setup. Also the call setup data travels great distances on signaling networks that are not always transmitting data at the speed of light. When the calls are international the variations in signaling networks grows the equipment handling call setup is usually not as fast as modem setup and the distances are even greater so call setup slows down even more. Further in general connection oriented virtual or physical circuit setup such as circuit switching requires more time at connection setup time than comparable connectionless techniques due to the end to end handshaking required between the conversing parties.

Message switching is another switching strategy that has been considered. With this form of switching no physical path is established in advance between the sender and receiver instead whenever the sender has a block of data to be sent it is stored at the first switching office and retransmitted to the next switching point after error inspection. Message switching places no limit on block size thus requiring that switching stations must have disks to buffer long blocks of data also a single block may tie up a line for many minutes rendering message switching useless for interactive traffic.

Packet switched networks which predominate the computer network industry divide data into small pieces called packets that are multiplexed onto high capacity intermachine connections. A packet is a block of data with a strict upper limit on block size that carries with it sufficient identification necessary for delivery to its destination. Such packets usually contain several hundred bytes of data and occupy a given transmission line for only a few tens of milliseconds. Delivery of a larger file via packet switching requires that it be broken into many small packets and sent one at a time from one machine to the other. The network hardware delivers these packets to the specified destination where the software reassembles them into a single file.

Packet switching is used by virtually all computer interconnections because of its efficiency in data transmissions. Packet switched networks use bandwidth on a circuit as needed allowing other transmissions to pass through the lines in the interim. Furthermore throughput is increased by the fact that a router or switching office can quickly forward to the next stop any given packet or portion of a large file that it receives long before the other packets of the file have arrived. In message switching the intermediate router would have to wait until the entire block was delivered before forwarding. Today message switching is no longer used in computer networks because of the superiority of packet switching.

To better understand the Internet a comparison to the telephone system is helpful. The public switched telephone network was designed with the goal of transmitting human voice in a more or less recognizable form. Their suitability has been improved for computer to computer communications but remains far from optimal. A cable running between two computers can transfer data at speeds in the hundreds of megabits and even gigabits per second. A poor error rate at these speeds would be only one error per day. In contrast a dial up line using standard telephone lines has a maximum data rate in the thousands of bits per second and a much higher error rate. In fact the combined bit rate times error rate performance of a local cable could be 11 orders of magnitude better than a voice grade telephone line. New technology however has been improving the performance of these lines.

The Internet is composed of a great number of individual networks together forming a global connection of thousands of computer systems. After understanding that machines are connected to the individual networks we can investigate how the networks are connected together to form an internetwork or an internet. At this point internet gateways and internet routers come into play.

In terms of architecture two given networks are connected by a computer that attaches to both of them. Internet gateways and routers provide those links necessary to send packets between networks and thus make connections possible. Without these links data communication through the Internet would not be possible as the information either would not reach its destination or would be incomprehensible upon arrival. A gateway may be thought of as an entrance to a communications network that performs code and protocol conversion between two otherwise incompatible networks. For instance gateways transfer electronic mail and data files between networks over the internet.

IP Routers are also computers that connect networks and is a newer term preferred by vendors. These routers must make decisions as to how to send the data packets it receives to its destination through the use of continually updated routing tables. By analyzing the destination network address of the packets routers make these decisions. Importantly a router does not generally need to decide which host or end user will receive a packet instead a router seeks only the destination network and thus keeps track of information sufficient to get to the appropriate network not necessarily the appropriate end user. Therefore routers do not need to be huge supercomputing systems and are often just machines with small main memories and little disk storage. The distinction between gateways and routers is slight and current usage blurs the line to the extent that the two terms are often used interchangeably. In current terminology a gateway moves data between different protocols and a router moves data between different networks. So a system that moves mail between TCP IP and OSI is a gateway but a traditional IP gateway that connects different networks is a router.

Now it is useful to take a simplified look at routing in traditional telephone systems. The telephone system is organized as a highly redundant multilevel hierarchy. Each telephone has two copper wires coming out of it that go directly to the telephone company s nearest end office also called a local central office. The distance is typically less than 10 km in the U.S. alone there are approximately 20 000 end offices. The concatenation of the area code and the first three digits of the telephone number uniquely specify an end office and help dictate the rate and billing structure.

The two wire connections between each subscriber s telephone and the end office are called local loops. If a subscriber attached to a given end office calls another subscriber attached to the same end office the switching mechanism within the office sets up a direct electrical connection between the two local loops. This connection remains intact for the duration of the call due to the circuit switching techniques discussed earlier.

If the subscriber attached to a given end office calls a user attached to a different end office more work has to be done in the routing of the call. First each end office has a number of outgoing lines to one or more nearby switching centers called toll offices. These lines are called toll connecting trunks. If both the caller s and the receiver s end offices happen to have a toll connecting trunk to the same toll office the connection may be established within the toll office. If the caller and the recipient of the call do not share a toll office then the path will have to be established somewhere higher up in the hierarchy. There are sectional and regional offices that form a network by which the toll offices are connected. The toll sectional and regional exchanges communicate with each other via high bandwidth inter toll trunks. The number of different kinds of switching centers and their specific topology varies from country to country depending on its telephone density.

Using Network Level Communication for Smooth User Connection In addition to the data transfer functionality of the Internet TCP IP also seeks to convince users that the Internet is a solitary virtual network. TCP IP accomplishes this by providing a universal interconnection among machines independent of the specific networks to which hosts and end users attach. Besides router interconnection of physical networks software is required on each host to allow application programs to use the Internet as if it were a single real physical network.

The basis of Internet service is an underlying connectionless packet delivery system run by routers with the basic unit of transfer being the packet. In internets running TCP IP such as the Internet backbone these packets are called datagrams. This section will briefly discuss how these datagrams are routed through the Internet.

In packet switching systems routing is the process of choosing a path over which to send packets. As mentioned before routers are the computers that make such choices. For the routing of information from one host within a network to another host on the same network the datagrams that are sent do not actually reach the Internet backbone. This is an example of internal routing which is completely self contained within the network. The machines outside of the network do not participate in these internal routing decisions.

At this stage a distinction should be made between direct delivery and indirect delivery. Direct delivery is the transmission of a datagram from one machine across a single physical network to another machine on the same physical network. Such deliveries do not involve routers. Instead the sender encapsulates the datagram in a physical frame addresses it and then sends the frame directly to the destination machine.

Indirect delivery is necessary when more than one physical network is involved in particular when a machine on one network wishes to communicate with a machine on another network. This type of communication is what we think of when we speak of routing information across the Internet backbone. In indirect delivery routers are required. To send a datagram the sender must identify a router to which the datagram can be sent and the router then forwards the datagram towards the destination network. Recall that routers generally do not keep track of the individual host addresses of which there are millions but rather just keeps track of physical networks of which there are thousands .

Essentially routers in the Internet form a cooperative interconnected structure and datagrams pass from router to router across the backbone until they reach a router that can deliver the datagram directly.

The changing face of the internet world causes a steady inflow of new systems and technology. The following three developments each likely to become more prevalent in the near future serve as an introduction to the technological arena.

Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM is a networking technology using a high speed connection oriented system for both local area and wide area networks. ATM networks require modern hardware including 

ATM incorporates features of both packet switching and circuit switching as it is designed to carry voice video and television signals in addition to data. Pure packet switching technology is not conducive to carrying voice transmissions because such transfers demand more stable bandwidth.

Frame relay systems use packet switching techniques but are more efficient than traditional systems. This efficiency is partly due to the fact that they perform less error checking than traditional X.25 packet switching services. In fact many intermediate nodes do little or no error checking at all and only deal with routing leaving the error checking to the higher layers of the system. With the greater reliability of today s transmissions much of the error checking previously performed has become unnecessary. Thus frame relay offers increased performance compared to traditional systems.

An Integrated Services Digital Network is an international telecommunications standard for transmitting voice video and data over digital lines most commonly running at 64 kilobits per second. The traditional phone network runs voice at only 4 kilobits per second. To adopt ISDN an end user or company must upgrade to ISDN terminal equipment central office hardware and central office software. The ostensible goals of ISDN include the following 

An ISP is composed of several disparate systems. As ISP integration proceeds formerly independent systems now become part of one larger whole with concomitant increases in the level of analysis testing scheduling and training in all disciplines of the ISP.

ATM asynchronous transfer mode pushes network control to the periphery of the network obviating the trunk and switching models of traditional circuit based telephony. It is expected to be deployed widely to accommodate these high bandwidth services.

WAF supports a general purpose foundation for secure transaction management including usage control auditing reporting and or payment. This general purpose foundation is called WAF Functions WAFFs . WAF also supports a collection of atomic application elements e.g. load modules that can be selectively aggregated together to form various WAFF capabilities called control methods and which serve as WAFF applications and operating system functions. When a host operating environment of an electronic appliance includes WAFF capabilities it is called a Rights Operating System ROS . WAFF load modules associated data and methods form a body of information that for the purposes of the present invention are called control information. WAFF control information may be specifically associated with one or more pieces of electronic content and or it may be employed as a general component of the operating system capabilities of a WAF installation.

WAFF transaction control elements reflect and enact content specific and or more generalized administrative for example general operating system control information. WAFF capabilities which can generally take the form of applications application models that have more or less configurability which can be shaped by WAF participants through the use for example of WAF templates to employ specific capabilities along for example with capability parameter data to reflect the elements of one or more express electronic agreements between WAF participants in regards to the use of electronic content such as commercially distributed products. These control capabilities manage the use of and or auditing of use of electronic content as well as reporting information based upon content use and any payment for said use. WAFF capabilities may evolve to reflect the requirements of one or more successive parties who receive or otherwise contribute to a given set of control information. Frequently for a WAF application for a given content model such as distribution of entertainment on CD ROM content delivery from an Internet repository or electronic catalog shopping and advertising or some combination of the above participants would be able to securely select from amongst available alternative control methods and apply related parameter data wherein such selection of control method and or submission of data would constitute their contribution of control information. Alternatively or in addition certain control methods that have been expressly certified as securely interoperable and compatible with said application may be independently submitted by a participant as part of such a contribution. In the most general example a generally certified load module certified for a given WAF arrangement and or content class may be used with many or any WAF application that operates in nodes of said arrangement. These parties to the extent they are allowed can independently and securely add delete and or otherwise modify the specification of load modules and methods as well as add delete or otherwise modify related information.

Normally the party who creates a WAF content container defines the general nature of the WAFF capabilities that will and or may apply to certain electronic information. A WAF content container is an object that contains both content for example commercially distributed electronic information products such as computer software programs movies electronic publications or reference materials etc. and certain control information related to the use of the object s content. A creating party may make a WAF container available to other parties. Control information delivered by and or otherwise available for use with WAF content containers comprise for commercial content distribution purposes WAFF control capabilities and any associated parameter data for electronic content. These capabilities may constitute one or more proposed electronic agreements and or agreement functions available for selection and or use with parameter data that manage the use and or the consequences of use of such content and which can enact the terms and conditions of agreements involving multiple parties and their various rights and obligations.

A WAF electronic agreement may be explicit through a user interface acceptance by one or more parties for example by a junior party who has received control information from a senior party or it may be a process amongst equal parties who individually assert their agreement. Agreement may also result from an automated electronic process during which terms and conditions are evaluated by certain WAF participant control information that assesses whether certain other electronic terms and conditions attached to content and or submitted by another party are acceptable do not violate acceptable control information criteria . Such an evaluation process may be quite simple for example a comparison to ensure compatibility between a portion of or all senior control terms and conditions in a table of terms and conditions and the submitted control information of a subsequent participant in a pathway of content control information handling or it may be a more elaborate process that evaluates the potential outcome of and or implements a negotiation process between two or more sets of control information submitted by two or more parties. WAF also accommodates a semi automated process during which one or more WAF participants directly through user interface means resolve disagreements between control information sets by accepting and or proposing certain control information that may be acceptable to control information representing one or more other parties interests and or responds to certain user interface queries for selection of certain alternative choices and or for certain parameter information the responses being adopted if acceptable to applicable senior control information.

When another party other than the first applier of rules perhaps through a negotiation process accepts and or adds to and or otherwise modifies in place content control information a WAF agreement between two or more parties related to the use of such electronic content may be created so long as any modifications are consistent with senior control information . Acceptance of terms and conditions related to certain electronic content may be direct and express or it may be implicit as a result of use of content depending for example on legal requirements previous exposure to such terms and conditions and requirements of in place control information .

WAFF capabilities may be employed and a WAF agreement may be entered into by a plurality of parties without the WAFF capabilities being directly associated with the controlling of certain specific electronic information. For example certain one or more WAFF capabilities may be present at a WAF installation and certain WAF agreements may have been entered into during the registration process for a content distribution application to be used by such installation for securely controlling WAF content usage auditing reporting and or payment. Similarly a specific WAF participant may enter into a WAF user agreement with a WAF content or electronic appliance provider when the user and or her appliance register with such provider as a WAF installation and or user. In such events WAFF in place control information available to the user WAF installation may require that certain WAFF methods are employed for example in a certain sequence in order to be able to use all and or certain classes of electronic content and or WAF applications.

WAF ensures that certain prerequisites necessary for a given transaction to occur are met. This includes the secure execution of any required load modules and the availability of any required associated data. For example required load modules and data e.g. in the form of a method might specify that sufficient credit from an authorized source must be confirmed as available. It might further require certain one or more load modules execute as processes at an appropriate time to ensure that such credit will be used in order to pay for user use of the content. A certain content provider might for example require metering the number of copies made for distribution to employees of a given software program a portion of the program might be maintained in encrypted form and require the presence of a WAF installation to run . This would require the execution of a metering method for copying of the property each time a copy was made for another employee. This same provider might also charge fees based on the total number of different properties licensed from them by the user and a metering history of their licensing of properties might be required to maintain this information.

These and other options will be discussed in more detail below.

Through use of WAF s control system traditional content providers and users can create electronic relationships that reflect traditional non electronic relationships. They can shape and modify commercial relationships to accommodate the evolving needs of and agreements among themselves. WAF does not require electronic content providers and users to modify their business practices and personal preferences to conform to a metering and control application program that supports limited largely fixed functionality. Furthermore WAF permits participants to develop business models not feasible with non electronic commerce for example involving detailed reporting of content usage information large numbers of distinct transactions at hitherto infeasibly low price points pass along control information that is enforced without involvement or advance knowledge of the participants etc.

The present invention allows content providers and users to formulate their transaction environment to accommodate 

WAF can support real commerce in an electronic form that is the progressive creation of commercial relationships that form over time a network of interrelated agreements representing a value chain business model. This is achieved in part by enabling content control information to develop through the interaction of negotiation between securely created and independently submitted sets of content and or appliance control information. Different sets of content and or appliance control information can be submitted by different parties in an electronic business value chain enabled by the present invention. These parties create control information sets through the use of their respective WAF installations. Independently securely deliverable component based control information allows efficient interaction among control information sets supplied by different parties.

WAF permits multiple separate electronic arrangements to be formed between subsets of parties in a WAF supported electronic value chain model. These multiple agreements together comprise a WAF value chain extended agreement. WAF allows such constituent electronic agreements and therefore overall WAF extended agreements to evolve and reshape over time as additional WAF participants become involved in WAF content and or appliance control information handling. WAF electronic agreements may also be extended as new control information is submitted by existing participants. With WAF electronic commerce participants are free to structure and restructure their electronic commerce business activities and relationships. As a result the present invention allows a competitive electronic commerce marketplace to develop since the use of WAF enables different widely varying business models using the same or shared content.

A significant facet of the present invention s ability to broadly support electronic commerce is its ability to securely manage independently delivered WAF component objects containing control information normally in the form of WAF objects containing one or more methods data or load module WAF components . This independently delivered control information can be integrated with senior and other pre existing content control information to securely form derived control information using the negotiation mechanisms of the present invention. All requirements specified by this derived control information must be satisfied before WAF controlled content can be accessed or otherwise used. This means that for example all load modules and any mediating data which are listed by the derived control information as required must be available and securely perform their required function. In combination with other aspects of the present invention securely independently delivered control components allow electronic commerce participants to freely stipulate their business requirements and trade offs. As a result much as with traditional non electronic commerce the present invention allows electronic commerce through a progressive stipulation of various control requirements by WAF participants to evolve into forms of business that are the most efficient competitive and useful.

WAF provides capabilities that rationalize the support of electronic commerce and electronic transaction management. This rationalization stems from the reusability of control structures and user interfaces for a wide variety of transaction management related activities. As a result content usage control data security information auditing and electronic financial activities can be supported with tools that are reusable convenient consistent and familiar. In addition a rational approach a transaction distribution control standard allows all participants in WAF the same foundation set of hardware control and security authoring administration and management tools to support widely varying types of information business market model and or personal objectives.

Employing WAF as a general purpose electronic transaction distribution control system allows users to maintain a single transaction management control arrangement on each of their computers networks communication nodes and or other electronic appliances. Such a general purpose system can serve the needs of many electronic transaction management applications without requiring distinct different installations for different purposes. As a result users of WAF can avoid the confusion and expense and other inefficiencies of different limited purpose transaction control applications for each different content and or business model. For example WAF allows content creators to use the same WAF foundation control arrangement for both content authoring and for licensing content from other content creators for inclusion into their products or for other use. Clearinghouses distributors content creators and other WAF users can all interact both with the applications running on their WAF installations and with each other in an entirely consistent manner using and reusing largely transparently the same distributed tools mechanisms and consistent user interfaces regardless of the type of WAF activity.

WAF participants in a commercial value chain can be commercially confident that is sufficiently confident for commercial purposes that the direct constituent and or extended electronic agreements they entered into through the use of WAF can be enforced reliably. These agreements may have both dynamic transaction management related aspects such as content usage control information enforced through budgeting metering and or reporting of electronic information and or appliance use and or they may include static electronic assertions such as an end user using the system to assert his or her agreement to pay for services not to pass to unauthorized parties electronic information derived from usage of content or systems and or agreeing to observe copyright laws. Not only can electronically reported transaction related information be trusted under the present invention but payment may be automated by the passing of payment tokens through a pathway of payment which may or may not be the same as a pathway for reporting . Such payment can be contained within a WAF container created automatically by a WAF installation in response to control information located in the preferred embodiment in one or more permissions records stipulating the withdrawal of credit or electronic currency such as tokens from an electronic account for example an account securely maintained by a user s WAF installation secure subsystem based upon usage of WAF controlled electronic content and or appliances such as governments financial credit providers and users .

WAF allows the needs of electronic commerce participants to be served and it can bind such participants together in a universe wide trusted commercial network that can be secure enough to support very large amounts of commerce. WAF s security and metering secure subsystem core will be present at all physical locations where WAF related content is a assigned usage related control information rules and mediating data and or b used. This core can perform security and auditing functions including metering that operate within a virtual black box a collection of distributed very secure WAF related hardware instances that are interconnected by secured information exchange for example telecommunication processes and distributed database means. WAF further includes highly configurable transaction operating system technology one or more associated libraries of load modules along with affiliated data WAF related administration data preparation and analysis applications as well as system software designed to enable WAF integration into host environments and applications. WAF s usage control information for example provide for property content and or appliance related usage authorization usage auditing which may include audit reduction usage billing usage payment privacy filtering reporting and security related communication and encryption techniques.

WAF s fundamental configurability will allow a broad range of competitive electronic commerce business models to flourish. It allows business models to be shaped to maximize revenues sources end user product value and operating efficiencies. WAF can be employed to support multiple differing models take advantage of new revenue opportunities and deliver product configurations most desired by users. Electronic commerce technologies that do not as the present invention does 

Some of the key factors contributing to the configurability intrinsic to the present invention include 

Referring to operation of one embodiment of the electronic commerce component of the present invention is provided for allowing purchase of products and services via a display catalog. The display catalog may display linkable pictures such as visual representations of products for sale. The display catalog may also display linkable text which could represent a product or family of products as well as services offered. Other linkable text or pictures could be implemented to provide multiple ways to traverse the display catalog to ease navigation along a page or between various pages. An exemplary link would include at least one textual or picture link displayed on each page of the display catalog that would permit a user to purchase the good or service shown on that page or associated with a particular good or service displayed on the page. Such link may resemble a shopping cart.

Preferably the default setting of the display catalog would be preset but the display format of the display catalog would be customizable based on user preference or automatically based on user profile. For example the user may be permitted to customize the format of the display catalog for his or her particular session or the customizations may be saved so that the user s personalized settings are used each time the display catalog is opened by that particular user. The display format may also be customized to display localized content such as by being based on the location of the user. Text may also be displayed in a language selected by the viewer.

As shown in operation outputs data relating to at least one of the products and services. Such data may include details of the products or services as well as specifications. The data and comparisons may be accessed through linking of pages containing the data with linkable pictures and text. For example a more detailed picture of a particular product illustrating its most salient features may be linked to a smaller or more generic picture of the product on a page displaying various similar products. More links may be used on the page displaying the data to obtain additional detail.

Optionally the data may be integrated to centralized publishing for integrity. In such case updated data would be downloaded to ensure the correctness and currentness of the information. A proactive notification could also be made near the time of download such as when updates to a specification are sent or received.

As shown in one embodiment of the electronic commerce component of the present invention is provided for facilitating a virtual shopping transaction. First a plurality of items i.e. products or services are selected from a database and displayed for purchase in operation . Preferably the items are displayed in an electronic catalog format. Next in operation a user is allowed to select a predetermined set of the items for purchase. For example each of the items could include a liked picture or text which a user would then simply click on with a mouse pointer to select the items. Other options include scrollable menus etc. In operation a payment is then accepted in exchange for the predetermined set of items. Such predetermined set of items is then stored in operation thereby allowing the user to collectively select the predetermined set of items at a later time without having to select each of the items individually. Note operation . The selected items are preferably stored in a database unique to the user. The set of items selected during each shopping session should be stored in a separate listing or file so that the user can individually select particular sets of items. Optionally the user may be allowed to name each stored set of items for easier identification later. The user may also be permitted to rate or rank the items of a selected set for purposes of refreshing the user s memory when the user later retrieves the set.

Ideally a quantity and a price of each of the items that is selected is displayed during use of the present invention. Also displayed is a total price of the items that are selected along with shipping information. During use the user is allowed to modify the predetermined set of items that are selected. Further several sets of items may be separately stored for later review and modification. Retrieval of the set or sets of items should be easily accessible throughout the display catalog such as through links.

Optionally multiple languages may be incorporated into the present invention and payment for the predetermined set of items may be accepted in any one of a plurality of currencies such as electronic and foreign.

Recently an online shopping system which allows examination selection and order of items through a computer has been put into practice. In such an online shopping system in order to supplement a disadvantage by a gap from ordinary shopping caused by the use of electronic means such as not capable of directly touching the item and not capable of getting assistance of a real salesman various devices for a user interface have been made. As one of such devices a so called shopping basket function which has some analogy with shopping basket used in a shop such as supermarket is proposed. In this function items on the online shopping are temporarily added to a purchase list and a process of order and purchase is conducted when all items to be purchased are registered on the list as items to be purchased in the supermarket are once put into a shopping basket and lastly the account is settled at a counter. In this manner by preparing the purchase list to order a plurality of items one time a time required to purchase may be substantially saved. Further the consumer may prevent the failure of shopping and stop the purchase of unnecessary items by checking the list once before the purchase. Further because of feel of easiness that the items once added on the purchase list may be finally changed in any way before the purchase there is a psychological effect that the consumer may proceed shopping readily.

The elements which constitute the shopping basket are a shopping basket main body purchase list and a function for taking in and out items for the shopping basket. As functions associated with the shopping basket there are a function to take the items into the shopping basket add to the purchase list a function to check the contents of the shopping basket display the purchase list a function to return the item in the shopping basket change the purchase list and a function to purchase the items in the shopping basket. However for the function to purchase the items only the order is accepted because the delivery of the items is made later except a portion of items which can be downloaded as digital data and the shopping is not completed until the items are received and the account is settled.

As one of methods for proving the shopping basket to the consumer there is a method of displaying a button for the shopping basket on the same display page as a catalog which the consumer watches as it is realized in the online shopping system mainly on the World Wide Web. As another method of proving the shopping basket there is a method for separately displaying an item catalog area and a shopping basket area. Such a function is used in the shopping system provided by a CD ROM.

A main stage of the online shopping is an item catalog screen on which information on the items is provided. The consumer examines the item on the screen and if he or she likes it he or she takes it into the shopping basket. During the shopping he or she examines the content of the shopping basket as required to check the item scheduled to purchase and the pay amount of the items. Accordingly it is not necessary to always display the purchase list on the screen but the functions to access to the shopping basket for taking in the items and to display the contents should be available to the consumer any time during the shopping.

As described above when the button for the shopping basket is on the same page as the item catalog the entire length of the page changes depending on the amount of item data described on the catalog the page may not be accommodated on the display screen. In such a case it is necessary for the consumer to scroll the page to press the button to display the button for the shopping basket in order to display the button. The same is true when the button is located at the top end of the page and when the item of interest is at a lower portion of the page the screen must be scrolled upward in order to take the item into the shopping basket after the confirmation. The state in which the necessary function is not displayed without scrolling not only imposes a burden to the operation of scroll and when the consumer first uses the system the operation to be conducted next is hard to understand and cause anxiety to the user. On the other hand in the method of always displaying the button in a specified area by dividing the screen the above problem is solved.

Further as a feature of an application on the Internet such as the World Wide Web high freedom of both information provider and user is pointed out. For example the user cannot previously limit the length of one page of the contents prepared by the information provider. The environment of the user such as a resolution of the display a type of browser software used and the setting of font varies from user to user and the information provider cannot know it. As a result however the information provider devises the amount of information and the layout described on the page to accommodate it in the screen the intended effect is not always achieved depending on the environment of the user. In the method of placing the button for the shopping basket on the same page as the catalog some degree of scrolling is unavoidable. On the other hand the method of dividing the screen and sharing the roles by the respective sub areas restricts the method for preparing the contents. It may be good that the user interface is uniform in one online shop but when it is applied across a plurality of online shops of various items and scales free design cannot be conducted. This forces to the user a specific environment such as to watch the window of the browser at a specified size and hence it does not conform to the Internet.

In accordance with the present invention an interface for providing the shopping basket function is provided as a separate shopping basket window from a catalog window on which online shop item data is displayed. The shopping basket window is displayed on the catalog window and a display position is moved in linkage with the movement of a mouse pointer. The shopping basket includes a list of items to be purchased which is a main body of the shopping basket a function to add the item data to the list and a function to change the item data registered in the list. In one embodiment of the present invention the shopping basket main body is not always displayed. Instead an interface function to display the shopping basket contents on the screen is provided on the shopping basket window.

One embodiment of the present invention provides for comparison shopping by utilizing the customer s profile to prioritize the features of a group of similar competing products as shown in operation of . The competing products may or may not have been manufactured by competing business entities. More detail is provided in . First in operation a customer s profile is developed. This profile may be developed from many sources including customer input customer buying habits customer income level customer searching habits customer profession customer education level customer s purpose of the pending sale customer s shopping habits etc. Such information may be input directly by the user captured as a user uses the network and may be downloaded periodically from a user s system. Next in operation a plurality of items for purchase are displayed from which the customer is allowed to select multiple similar items i.e. products or services to compare in operation . Then after a set of features of each item is determined in operation operation creates a hierarchy of the features of the items selected in accordance with the customer s profile. For example as shown in a comparison of features based on keywords taken from the customer s profile may be performed in operation . The features would be preassociated with feature keywords in operation . When a keyword input by the user matches a feature keyword the feature is given priority in operation . Features with feature keywords having multiple matches are given highest priority and ranked according to the number of matches in operation . If no keywords match the user s words could be analyzed using a thesaurus to find keyword matches but these would be given lower priority in operation . Then in operation of a comparison table is presented with the features organized in a prioritized manner in accordance with the hierarchy. A particular item may be chosen and similar competing items would be compared to it. For example the prices of a service may be compared to the prices of other similar services. The advantages of selected items could also be highlighted against similar competing and noncompeting items.

With reference now to operation of another embodiment of the electronic commerce component of the present invention is provided for facilitating a virtual shopping transaction by ascertaining needs of a user. A more detailed description is shown in . First needs and requirements of a user are input by the user. Then the needs and requirements are analyzed in operation . Available products are reviewed in and placed on a list from which one or more items will be selected based on the user input. Next in operation a solution is generated based on the requirements of the user after which the solution is displayed as indicated in operation . provides an example of operation . The items would be preassociated with keywords in operation . In operation selection of items based on keyword taken from the user input may be performed. When a keyword input by the user matches a keyword associated with an item the item is displayed in operation . If no keywords match the user s words could be analyzed using a thesaurus to find keyword matches in operation . A payment is then accepted in exchange for the solution in operation of as will be discussed in more detail below. It should be noted that in the present description the solution includes either a product or a service or both.

As an option the solution may be stored for allowing the purchase of the solution at a later time. Further the solution may be grouped with a plurality of items selected for being purchased together. In the foregoing description the needs of the user may refer to parameters including either capacity performance or cost. It should be noted that the needs of the user are assessed by receiving input from the user.

In still yet another embodiment a method system and article of manufacture is provided for allowing a user to customize an item for purchase in a virtual shopping environment as shown in operation . provides more detail. Referring to a plurality of items for purchase are first displayed in operation as discussed above. Each of the items includes a plurality of available features which are displayed in operation preferably with the price of each feature including cost for adding the feature and cost savings for removing the feature. Next a user is permitted to select the available features of each of the items to be purchased as indicated in operation . For example a user may indicate which features of the item the user wants to be included with the item and which items the user wishes absent or removed. If the item is a product an illustration or picture of the product with only the selected features should be made available so that the user can see the product in various configurations. As an option a total price and availability may be determined with respect to the selected items and the selected features thereof for display purposes in operation . Further in operation payment is accepted in exchange for the selected items and the selected features thereof. It should be noted that in the foregoing description the items each include either a product or a service or both and may also include third party products and services.

While the available features which are displayed the features of the items that are unavailable are hidden. Further the selected features are stored for allowing the user to collectively select the selected features at a later time without having to select each of the features individually.

The present invention provides a system and method for conducting commerce via an electronic means such as a computer network cable television network or direct dial modem. Previous attempts to provide electronic commerce subsystems have been custom tailored to an individual commerce offering and have not been adaptable to be able to provide a versatile system capable of supporting a wide range of providers of goods and services.

To meet this need several companies have developed computer architectures for online electronic catalog sales using for example the Internet as a transport mechanism to transmit data representing purchase requests between a proprietary browser and server product pair.

For example Netscape Communications uses its Navigator Netsite World Wide Web WWW browser server pair. A buyer uses a Navigator to select a seller s Netsite server sort of an electronic storefront which is in turn coupled to standard application servers back end subsystems e.g. a credit server or a member server for collecting demographic information on customers. These servers contain the business rules defined by the seller e.g. what credit cards are accepted and what customer information is tracked during each sale. Some of these servers are connected to external third party services e.g. the credit server to an external credit card processing network or the member server to an external demographics processing module. The actual applications e.g. on line publishing or catalog sales are represented as extensions of the application servers. Equivalently the application servers are said to be instantiated in the applications. The net result of this approach is that the business rules from the application servers are embedded into the applications along with the application logic or presentation.

Another company Open Market is developing a similar electronic catalog system consisting of a HyperText Markup Language HTML authoring tool called Storebuilder and a server called WebServer connected to an integrated back end commerce system called TransactionLink . This system appears to share similar characteristics and disadvantages as the Netscape system.

Any of the foregoing types of browsers may employed to access various databases via the Internet in order to conduct electronic commerce related business. Typical database or file based shopping cart systems require that the user be uniquely identified in order to associate particular data stored on the server with a particular user. This requires the user to log in or create an account which is then stored in the server. Each subsequent request from the user must reference the unique identifier either in the uniform resource locator URL or as hidden data passed back through a form submission. Either of these approaches require that the account or ID information of the user be stored on the remote server in the network for some definite period of time. Usually the user must keep track of the account identifier in order that the prior session information can be retrieved.

It is desirable to the extent possible existing terminal hardware appropriately adapted and modified to incorporate the principles of the present invention. Hardware suitable for this purpose is sold by NCR. This equipment a self service terminal system identified as model NCR 5682 incorporates the data gathering and transaction processing capabilities of conventional automated teller machines with video graphics audio and printer operations. Interactivity with the customer is governed by a software system through the use for example of a keyboard or an infrared touch screen using prompts. Transactions may be completed through the use of a credit card reader and a PIN number entering means.

In one example of a related system insurance agents at remote office on line terminals communicate with a central processor which includes a data bank storing data as to risks to be insured client information insurance premium information and predetermined text data for incorporation into insurance contracts. An agent at a terminal keys in information regarding a risk and other data needed to write insurance for that risk. To assist him a form is displayed on his terminal by the central processor and he merely enters the pertinent information in the blanks provided. The information is correlated in the central processor from which a premium quotation is transmitted back and displayed at the agent s terminal and in which a client data base is established with the information from the form. Errors or omissions are detected and the agent or client is notified. If the policy is to be written a formal contract is printed under the control of the central processor and electronically stored and displayed to underwriter personnel. Concurrently the insurance contract is mailed to the client. The underwriter can decide to cancel or alter the contract. Alternatively the underwriting function is carried out before the contract is printed and mailed. In this system the terminals operate on line underwriting is performed by a human underwriter and the insurance contract is printed remotely from the client and mailed to him. The on line terminals are not automatic self service vending machines the client must deal with the company through agents.

In another example of a related system a terminal includes a CPU and is coupled to a memory unit which has data bases storing information. Certain elements are assigned weights. The system is used by underwriters to assist them in performing their underwriting functions.

Still yet another system is adapted for automatically dispensing information goods and services to a customer on a self service basis including a central data processing center in which information on services offered is stored. Self service information sales terminals are remotely linked on line to the central data processing center and are programmed to gather information from prospective customers on goods and services desired to transmit to customers information on the desired goods or services from the central data processing center to take orders for goods or services from customers and transmit them for processing to the central data processing center to accept payment and to deliver goods or services in the form of documents to the customer when orders are completed. The central data processing center is also remotely linked to institutions such as insurance companies serviced by the system to keep the institution updated on completed sales of services offered by that institution. As noted the terminals in this system are on line with the central data processing center.

Another system is provided using self service terminals for dispensing voice and video information printed documents and goods and for accepting orders and payments therefor for travel related services by currency or credit card. The self service terminals include a processor printer dispenser data sources including a mass storage unit a card reader a coin box and a communication device for communicating with a remote service center. The mass storage unit stores transitory information such as flight schedules ticket prices weather information and other information useful in the planning of a business trip or vacation which is periodically updated via a communication link with the remote control center. The self service terminal normally operates off line.

Payment for items purchased over the Internet is also a concern. Today approximately 350 billion coin and currency transactions occur between individuals and institutions every year. The extensive use of coin and currency transactions has limited the automation of individual transactions such as purchases fares and bank account deposits and withdrawals. Individual cash transactions are burdened by the need to have the correct amount of cash or providing change therefor. Furthermore the handling and managing of paper cash and coins is inconvenient costly and time consuming for both individuals and financial institutions.

Although checks may be written for any specific amount up to the amount available in the account checks have very limited transferability and must be supplied from a physical inventory. Paper based checking systems do not offer sufficient relief from the limitations of cash transactions sharing many of the inconveniences of handling currency while adding the inherent delays associated with processing checks. To this end economic exchange has striven for greater convenience at a lower cost while also seeking improved security.

Automation has achieved some of these qualities for large transactions through computerized electronic funds transfer EFT systems. Electronic funds transfer is essentially a process of value exchange achieved through the banking system s centralized computer transactions. EFT services are a transfer of payments utilizing electronic checks which are used primarily by large commercial organizations.

The Automated Clearing House ACH where a user can enter a pre authorized code and download information with billing occurring later and a Point Of Sale POS system where a transaction is processed by connecting with a central computer for authorization for the transaction granted or denied immediately are examples of EFT systems that are utilized by retail and commercial organizations.

Home Banking bill payment services are examples of an EFT system used by individuals to make payments from a home computer. Currently home banking initiatives have found few customers. Of the banks that have offered services for payments account transfers and information over the telephone lines using personal computers less than one percent of the bank s customers are using the service. One reason that Home Banking has not been a successful product is because the customer cannot deposit and withdraw money as needed in this type of system.

Current EFT systems credit cards or debit cards which are used in conjunction with an on line system to transfer money between accounts such as between the account of a merchant and that of a customer cannot satisfy the need for an automated transaction system providing an ergonomic interface.

To implement an automated convenient transaction that can dispense some form of economic value there has been a trend towards off line payments. For example numerous ideas have been proposed for some form of electronic money that can be used in cashless payment transactions as alternatives to the traditional currency and check types of payment systems.

The more well known techniques include magnetic stripe cards purchased for a given amount and from which a prepaid value can be deducted for specific purposes. Upon exhaustion of the economic value the cards are thrown away. Other examples include memory cards or so called smart cards which are capable of repetitively storing information representing value that is likewise deducted for specific purposes.

It is desirable for a computer operated under the control of a merchant to obtain information offered by a customer and transmitted by a computer operating under the control of the customer over a publicly accessible packet switched network e.g. the Internet to the computer operating under the control of the merchant without risking the exposure of the information to interception by third parties that have access to the network and to assure that the information is from an authentic source. It is further desirable for the merchant to transmit information including a subset of the information provided by the customer over such a network to a payment gateway computer system that is designated by a bank or other financial institution that has the responsibility of providing payment on behalf of the customer to authorize a commercial transaction on behalf of such a financial institution without the risk of exposing that information to interception by third parties. Such institutions include for example financial institutions offering credit or debit card services.

Such secure payment technologies include Secure Transaction Technology STT Secure Electronic Payments Protocol SEPP Internet Keyed Payments iKP Net Trust and Cybercash Credit Payment Protocol. One of ordinary skill in the art readily comprehends that any of the secure payment technologies can be substituted for the SET protocol without undue experimentation. Such secure payment technologies require the customer to operate software that is compliant with the secure payment technology interacting with third party certification authorities thereby allowing the customer to transmit encoded information to a merchant some of which may be decoded by the merchant and some which can be decoded only by a payment gateway specified by the customer.

Another such attempt to provide such a secure transmission channel is a general purpose secure communication protocol such as Netscape Inc. s Secure Sockets Layer hereinafter SSL as described in Freier Kariton Kocher hereinafter Freier The SSL Protocol Version 3.0 March 1996 and hereby incorporated by reference. SSL provides a means for secure transmission between two computers. SSL has the advantage that it does not require special purpose software to be installed on the customer s computer because it is already incorporated into widely available software that many people utilize as their standard Internet access medium and does not require that the customer interact with any third party certification authority. Instead the support for SSL may be incorporated into software already in use by the customer e.g. the Netscape Navigator World Wide Web browsing tool. However although a computer on an SSL connection may initiate a second SSL connection to another computer a drawback to the SSL approach is each SSL connection supports only a two computer connection. Therefore SSL does not provide a mechanism for transmitting encoded information to a merchant for retransmission to a payment gateway such that a subset of the information is readable to the payment gateway but not to the merchant. Although SSL allows for robustly secure two party data transmission it does not meet the ultimate need of the electronic commerce market for robustly secure three party data transmission. Other examples of general purpose secure communication protocols include Private Communications Technology PCT from Microsoft Inc. Secure Hyper Text Transport Protocol SHTTP from Terisa Systems Shen Kerberos Photuris Pretty Good Privacy PGP which meets the IPSEC criteria. One of ordinary skill in the art readily comprehends that any of the general purpose secure communication protocols can be substituted for the SSL transmission protocol without undue experimentation.

Banks desire an Internet payment solution that emulates existing Point of Sale POS applications that are currently installed on their host computers and require minimal changes to their host systems. This is a critical requirement since any downtime for a banks host computer system represents an enormous expense. Currently VeriFone supports over fourteen hundred different payment related applications. The large number of applications is necessary to accommodate a wide variety of host message formats diverse methods for communicating to a variety of hosts with different dial up and direct connect schemes and different certification around the world. In addition there are a wide variety of business processes that dictate how a Point of Sale POS terminal queries a user for data and subsequently displays the data. Also various vertical market segments such as hotels car rental agencies restaurants retail sales mail sales telephone sales require interfaces for different types of data to be entered and provide different discount rates to merchants for complying with various data types. Moreover a plethora of report generation mechanisms and formats are utilized by merchants that banking organizations work with.

Banks are unwilling to converge on standards since convergence would facilitate switching from one acquiring bank to another by merchants. In general banks desire to increase the cost that a merchant incurs in switching from one acquiring bank to another acquiring bank. This is accomplished by supplying a merchant with a terminal that only communicates utilizing the bank s proprietary protocol and by providing other value added services that a merchant may not be able to obtain at another bank.

Internet based payment solutions require additional security measures that are not found in conventional POS terminals. This additional requirement is necessitated because Internet communication is done over publicly accessible unsecured communication line in stark contrast to the private secure dedicated phone or leased line service utilized between a traditional merchant and an acquiring bank. Thus it is critical that any solution utilizing the Internet for a communication backbone employ some form of cryptography.

As discussed above the current state of the art in Internet based payment processing is a protocol referred to as SET. Since the SET messages are uniform across all implementations banks cannot differentiate themselves in any reasonable way. Also since SET is not a proper superset of all protocols utilized today there are bank protocols which cannot be mapped or translated into SET because they require data elements for which SET has no placeholder. Further SET only handles the message types directly related to authorizing and capturing credit card transactions and adjustments to these authorizations or captures. In a typical POS terminal in the physical world these messages comprise almost the entire volume of the total number of messages between the merchant and the authorizing bank but only half of the total number of different message types. These message types which are used infrequently but which are critical to the operation of the POS terminal must be supported for proper transaction processing.

With the increasing popularity of computer communications many companies are becoming interested in advertising and supporting their products using an online computer service that can be accessed by customers. However creating a large online computer service is an extensive task. To develop a sophisticated online service such as America Online CompuServe Genie or Prodigy a company must have a large mainframe computer and customized software. Developing the customized software requires a competent programming staff and a good deal of time. Most companies do not have the resources required to develop such systems and thus cannot easily develop and maintain an online presence.

One way a company can contact millions of potential customers is to use the global Internet. The global Internet is a network of computer networks that links together millions of computer systems using the well defined TCP IP protocol.

A new method of distributing and viewing information known as the World Wide Web has recently become very popular on the global Internet. The World Wide Web is a collection of servers connected to the Internet that provide multi media information to users that request the information. The users access the information using client programs called browsers to display the multi media information.

World Wide Web servers store multi media information in a document format known as HyperText Markup Language HTML . The World Wide Web servers distribute the HTML formatted documents using a specific communication protocol known as the HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP .

To access the multi media information available on World Wide Web servers a user runs a client browser program that accesses the HTML formatted documents stored on the HTTP servers connected to the global Internet. The client browser program retrieves the formatted information and provides the information in an appropriate manner to the user. For example the client browser program displays graphical image information as images on the user s graphical display screen plays video information as video animation on the user s graphical display screen displays text information as text on the user s screen and plays sound samples using the speakers on the user s computer system. Mosaic one popular client browser program is widely available to the users of the global Internet.

For a company that wishes to develop an online presence creating a World Wide Web Server would provide a feature rich online service available to customers and clients. A World Wide Web Server can store images text animation and sounds that provide information about the company. Furthermore World Wide Web Servers can be implemented on relatively simple computer systems including personal computers.

Most World Wide Web Servers are coupled to the global Internet. By deploying a World Wide Web Server on the global Internet a company would create online service that is accessible to the millions of global Internet users.

Alternatively a company can deploy a HTTP server that is available to customers through dial up phone service. A dial up HTTP server would be accessible to customers and clients that do not have Internet access. Thus by creating a simple HTTP server any organization or corporation can create an online presence.

However quickly creating the HTML formatted documents required for a World Wide Web Server is not a trivial task. Moreover the standard HTTP server software without any additional programming is very limited. For example without custom extensions an HTTP server cannot accommodate complex transactions between a user and the HTTP server or integrate a database system into an online service. Although it is possible to write custom extensions to the HTTP server software using a conventional programming language such custom extensions are difficult to write except by experienced programmers. Thus to be able to quickly deploy full featured HTTP servers it would be desirable to have a development tool usable by non programmers that allows a developer to quickly and easily create a full featured online service based upon the HTTP and HTML standards.

Many programming development tools are known in the art. These programming development tools range from tools which are developed and marketed as general purpose programming development tools to sophisticated special purpose development tools for developing specific types of applications.

For example the Information Exchange Facility IEF general development tool which is available from Texas Instruments is used by professional programmers to develop application programs. Essentially IEF provides a facility that allows a programmer to write pseudo code and IEF generates an intermediate source code program in a high level programming language such as COBOL or C code based on the pseudo code . IEF is an example of what will be referred to herein as a general purpose development tool because it allows development of programs for essentially any purpose or application dependent on the input provided by the programmer.

In contrast to general purpose software development tools many application programs themselves provide special purpose development tool capability. An example is the Paradox database program available from Borland International of Scotts Valley Calif. The Paradox database allows end users to develop sophisticated database applications which would have been developed by professional programmers a few years ago. The Paradox database is but one example of a special purpose development tool.

Another example of a special purpose development tool is the Application Development Environment of Lotus Notes which is available from Lotus Development Corporation of Cambridge Mass. The Application Development Environment of Lotus Notes provides features which are said to allow for rapid development of workgroup applications such as sharing of documents between users over a network.

The ability to perform commercial transactions that involve order entry systems would allow an online system to sell goods and services to computer users. It is now recognized that many functions such as traditional order entry systems and the like will someday be carried out over computer networks by allowing a customer to place orders for goods and services directly with an online service. By way of example even today food orders can be placed with restaurants over computer networks videos can be reserved at the local video store and banking transactions can be carried out simply by logging onto a computer network.

Four different types of commercial transactions might commonly occur in a commercial online service. First a user may be charged for the right to access all or parts of a useful publicly accessible online system. Second the online service may pay the user for performing some type of action such as winning a contest or completing a marketing survey. Third an online service may charge a content provider for placing certain information on the online service. For example a content provider can be charged for placing an advertisement on the online service. Finally a content provider can be paid by the online service for providing information that users may wish to access can be can be provided on a for fee basis. Conversely an online service provider may wish to pay third party content providers for placing useful material on the online service.

Thus when creating a publicly accessible online system it is desirable to include the ability to define fee structures for accessing parts of the online system and or ordering other goods or services. However creating a sophisticated commercial online service with such features usually requires specialized programming.

One embodiment of the electronic commerce component of the present invention is adapted for advertising in a virtual shopping environment in operation of . illustrates the operation in more detail. In operation a plurality of items i.e. products or services are displayed for purchase. Along with the items being displayed for purchase or on a subsequent page or pages advertisement information which relates to at least one of the items displayed for purchase are displayed in operation . provides more detail of operation . The advertisements are preferably preassociated with individual items or may be associated with an entire classes of items in operation . When the items are selected for display one or more of the advertisements is automatically displayed as well in operation . In operation if there are many advertisements the advertisements are rotated so that each gets an equal amount of display time or according to the premium paid by the advertiser. A user is permitted to select the items for purchase as indicated by operation . Payment is then accepted in exchange for the selected items in operation . While the virtual shopping environment is being used advertisement information may be displayed which relates to at least one of the items for purchase and also relates to the user based on the profile of the user. This is particularly useful where the advertisements are being rotated. Then the advertiser would be billed based upon the number of times its advertisement was shown Note that the items each include at least one of a product and a service.

As an option the advertisement information may further include promotion information or advertise another item separate from the item to which the advertisement information is related. As yet another option the advertisement information is specifically tailored for the user based on a profile of the user. Further cross selling and up selling based on a product or service as well as of the user may be provided. Ideally all cross selling up selling advertisements and promotions are linked to pages containing greater detail or to a purchasing area.

The use of advertising revenues to pay for information dissemination is well established in domains such as television and radio in which end users are tuned to a continuous signal over a lengthy period of time. In such systems due to the continuous nature of the signal being monitored by the end users the end users are sufficiently similar to a captive audience that many or most end users remain tuned to the same signal even when the main program to which they are listening or viewing is interrupted by advertisements.

Another example of advertising mixed with information dissemination is the use of scrolled text at the bottom of a television of computer screen where the main program occupies most of the end user s visual field and a smaller portion is occupied by advertisements and the like on a scroll bar or similar visual device along the periphery of the screen. In some contexts such as cable television channels that display a stock ticker tape this relationship is reversed the information portion of the screen occupies a small part of the screen such as horizontally scrolling image region at the top or bottom of the display and the remainder of the screen is occupied by advertisements infomercials and the like.

Yet another example of mixing advertisements with information dissemination are newspapers and magazines.

Most and perhaps all such examples of mixing advertisements with information content are based on systems in which the end user has actively elected to view or listen to a program or to otherwise receive information. Furthermore in virtually all such systems or media the juxtaposition or placement of advertisements and information content is explicitly programmed or determined by human beings working as editors or in a similar content and or presentation editing capacity.

Distributing information via the Internet or other publicly accessible computer communication networks has been largely unsupported by advertising revenues due to the lack of good mechanisms for mixing advertising and information content in such a way as to be acceptable to both end users and advertisers. There are of course some exceptions where advertising content mixtures from other contexts such as newspapers and television have been simply replicated on the Internet. For instance some newspapers have been published at least in part on the Internet and include advertisements along with information content. In fact some newspapers sell advertising space on an associated World Wide Web WWW site which often includes extensive listings of certain types of advertisements such as real estate advertisements personal advertisements and so on. Similarly the scroll bar type advertisement at the bottom of a computer screen is based on similar advertising techniques used in cable television and other television contexts.

There are also examples of computer programs which contain advertisements. In all such examples known to the inventors the advertisements are either permanently embedded in the computer programs or reside permanently with computer programs such that they cannot be easily updated.

Next provided is a method system and article of manufacture for selectively determining prices and availability of items i.e. products or services for purchase in a virtual shopping environment based on a user profile as performed by operation of . illustrates the operation in more detail. As shown in in operation a user profile is created from input about a user. The user profile is preferably created in a manner that predicts buying tendencies. The virtual shopping environment is tailored automatically based on the user profile. A plurality of items i.e. products or services for purchase are displayed as discussed above. One example would be selecting at least one item for purchase based on the profile of the user in operation and displaying those items before other items in operation . For example the items may be placed in groups the groups being based on estimated buying tendencies. Then items from the group most closely matching the user s buying tendency as determined above are displayed. Further the user is allowed to select the items for purchase in operation . Factors that are tailored include price and availability of the items. Payment is then accepted in exchange for the selected items in operation as discussed in more detail below.

The virtual shopping environment may be tailored by generating prices associated with the items based on the profile of the user. As an option some or all of the prices may be promotional prices. The promotional prices may be offered based on the particular product or on the profile of the user. Further available credit and the terms of receiving that credit may be produced based on the profile of the user.

The virtual shopping environment is further tailored by generating prices associated with the items based on a geographic location of the user and may be designed to handle multiple types of currency. At least one of the prices that is generated may be stored and subsequently displayed during a subsequent use of the virtual shopping environment by the user. The virtual shopping environment may also be tailored by varying availability of the items based on the profile of the user.

The tremendous number of product types available to consumers at the retail level e.g. in food and grocery personal care hardware and appliances means that a retailer may have thousands of models or varieties of goods in inventory each of course with a concomitant price. The result of this multitude of consumer products is that the control and consistency of pricing has assumed increasing importance especially where retailing is highly competitive and price management is essential for a merchant to keep pace with competitors.

One area that has produced such a multitude of products and that has become a highly competitive selling environment is consumer appliances and electronics. Each type of product e.g. a television set is typically available from several different manufacturers and each manufacturer typically produces several models of the same type product. The prices of products vary from manufacturer to manufacturer as well as within the same manufacturer s range of models depending upon the particular specifications and features of each model within the product type. Moreover each manufacturer sells its products through a large number of distributors and ultimately to retail stores with the result that the pricing of the same product can differ from distributor to distributor from retailer to retailer and from geographic market to geographic market. Even within a single merchant s inventory price variations on an individual product occur e.g. an advertised special versus the regular price.

To keep pace with competitors a merchant may obtain pricing information by reviewing competitors advertisements printed or otherwise by actual shopping of competitors and viewing of price tags in a competitor s store or outlet or from a customer at the point of sale who claims that a certain product can be purchased from a competitor for a certain i.e. lower price. Sale prices are particularly problematic as such prices are typically only valid for a defined period after which the sale price reverts to the regular price. If a merchant wishes to change prices in response to a competitor s price usually special effort is required to change price tags at points of sale to meet or beat the competitor s price. The manual nature of the process does not permit prices to change frequently such as once or twice per day. Such frequency is prohibitive and thus a merchant cannot respond daily to market price changes involving hundreds to thousands of products. Moreover keeping track of the valid period for sale prices adds yet another layer of complexity. Further if a competitor s pricing becomes known at the point of sale the salesperson must determine if he or she is willing to sell the product for a lower or the same price i.e. in accordance with the merchant s pricing policy .

Various pricing systems are known although virtually none implement complex pricing policies. Many systems especially in the stock brokerage area will provide market pricing of stocks. While these systems can accommodate a continually changing price situation the actual pricing of course is independent of the system i.e. pricing is controlled by the stock market.

The current wide ranging use of computer systems provides a relatively large potential market to providers of electronic content or information.

These providers may include for example advertisers and other information publishers such as newspaper and magazine publishers. A cost however is involved with providing electronic information to individual consumers. For example hardware and maintenance costs are involved in establishing and maintaining information servers and networks. In addition labor costs are involved in keeping the information in the servers current.

One source which can be accessed to provide the monetary resources necessary to establish and maintain such an electronic information network is the individual end users which consume the electronic information. This electronic information however has different value to different users. For example some users will be very accepting of advertising as part of the electronic information whereas others will be opposed to receiving advertisements. Thus it would be beneficial to provide a system which allows individual users to control the amount of electronic advertising they receive with their electronic content.

In addition providers of electronic advertisements would be able to subsidize the cost of electronic content for end users. The amount of this subsidy would be dependent on the amount of electronic advertising which is consumed by the end users and the perceived quality of these consumers. Thus it would be beneficial to provide a system which allows the providers of electronic advertisements to provide advertising based subsidization of electronic content consumption based upon the perceived quality of consumers who have specifically chosen to consume these advertisements cognizant of the fact that consuming these advertisements will subsidize their electronic content consumption fees.

Referring to operation of another embodiment of the electronic commerce component of the present invention receives an order for at least one of the products and services. User information is collected for order processing including an address for delivery and billing. In the alternative a user may enter an alphanumeric code representative of a source of currency such as a credit card number or bank account number. Optionally the user may be allowed to select a shipping provider other than a default provider. The availability of the desired product is confirmed as are the price and shipping arrangements. As an option the invention may require the user to confirm that the desired product or service has been ordered that the price is satisfactory and that the desired shipping provider is selected.

As shown in operation calculates at least one of a tax and a shipping fee for at least one of the items i.e. products and services for which the order is received. The tax cost for each order is calculated and may include a listing of the tax per item. The shipping costs for each item or order may also be calculated such as by taking into account handling costs the total weight of the items the distance to final destination of the items and the corresponding charges of the shipping provider. An estimate of the delivery date may also be given. It should be noted that mileage and the like could be calculated where services are to be rendered at a location remote to the provider.

Optionally mathematical formulas based on multiple applicable tax laws may be used in the calculation of the tax. Such applicable tax laws may include only domestic taxes for domestic delivery and may include applicable foreign tax laws for imported and exported items.

Another embodiment of the invention processes transactions pertinent to the purchase of items. For example credit card transactions are processed as are purchase order transactions. A structured payment plan may also be created. The actual order is placed with a fulfillment house for physical shipping of a product or the order is placed with a provider of an ordered service. Optionally notification may be sent to the user to notify the user that the transaction is being completed or confirmation that the order has been completed. Also optionally a tracking number may be sent to the user for assisting a user to determine the shipping status of a product.

 e retrieving the article ordered by the customer from a storage location for the article at the automated store by a system for retrieving articles communicating with the host computer and delivering the article to the article pickup area.

The method can further comprise the step of the host computer detecting an inventory level threshold below which inventory of the article is to be restocked.

As shown in a method system and article of manufacture is provided for automatically generating a contract between an owner of software and a user of the software. First in operation a user is allowed to request to utilize a software package after which user input relating to the user is requested and received. See operation and respectively. Such information may include identification information such as name address etc. In operation a tailored license agreement is then generated by utilizing the user input. illustrates a procedure for performing operation . In operation the terms of the license agreement are set forth. Licensor identification information is included in operation . Licensee user identification information is set forth in operation . Optionally verification of identification may be performed in operation such as prompting a user to enter his or her telephone number and cross referencing the input number with telephone listings.

As an option the license agreement may be sent to the user via electronic mail or the like in operation . The present invention may further track entitlements of the user granted under the license agreement. The user may even be prevented from utilizing the software until the license agreement is generated.

Most software vendors currently favor licensing as the preferred method of distributing software. Licensing software provides the vendor with a certain amount of control over the distributed software which may be used to the vendor s advantage. For example licensing software allows the vendor to prohibit unauthorized usage of the software that might facilitate unauthorized copying. In addition licensing provides an advantageous method of providing and billing for software. Through licensing the vendor may sell several identical copies of the same software and charge the buyer for each copy.

Licensing schemes have adapted to the network environment as well as the individual personal computer. In a network environment such as a client server network multiple users may access the same copy of a particular application. Consequently the vendor can charge the network owner not for the number of copies installed on the network but for the number of users having access to the software.

Software is conventionally licensed using an agreement between the vendor and the user or administrator. The agreement is typically either a conventionally signed contract or a shrink wrap agreement attached to the packaging for the software to which the licensee acknowledges agreement by opening the package.

Although traditional licensing and shrink wrap licensing are more or less applicable to licensing for individual systems they are not well suited to the network environment. Both traditional and shrink wrap licensing schemes are difficult to enforce on a network where several users have access to the software. Consequently various electronic systems have been devised for controlling access to software on a network.

Electronic licensing typically comprises providing a set of criteria under which a request for an application from the server should be granted. One licensing system uses a fixed set of licenses controlled by a license server. The license information is maintained in a license database along with information regarding which applications are in use and how many units are still available. The information in the database may be encrypted to prevent forgeries. When an application is desired the application commences running. Code embedded in the application initially requests a license from the server to facilitate the execution of the application. The server checks the database of licenses and if the appropriate licenses are available grants the request. As requests are received and licenses granted the relevant information is logged into a file to track usage of the various applications.

If a license is not available the client contacts another server to find the appropriate license. The client in the conventional system has the responsibility to obtain licenses from the various servers and the individual servers provide resources at the client s request. To facilitate such licensing the application typically includes a library of programs designed to contact the server request a license and track the resulting license.

When a call is made to a server all of the execution occurs on each individual server for any particular call. Similarly if a license is located on a particular machine all execution necessary to operate on that license occurs on that machine. Consequently a central server containing most of the licenses available on a particular network is mainly responsible for maintaining the licenses.

In addition conventional licensing systems rely on code embedded in the application to establish the licensing attributes. Code is placed in the application which interprets information received from the server to establish licensing parameters. Because the behavior of the license is not established until after the request has been made and the license obtained the user cannot read the license terms prior to the request. In addition this system lacks flexibility. To change the licensing terms the code in the application must be revised.

Recently generation and sales of software programs have become significant businesses both for companies which are primarily vendors of hardware as well as for companies which vend software alone. Software is typically sold under license that is vendors transfer copies of software to users under a license which governs how the users may use the software. Typically software costs are predicated on some belief as to the amount of usage which the software program may provide and the economic benefits such as cost saving which may otherwise be incurred which the software may provide to the users. Thus license fees may be based on the power of the processor or the number of processors in the system or the number of individual nodes in a network since these factors provide measures of the number of users which may use the software at any give time.

In many cases however it may also be desirable for example to have licenses and license fees more closely relate to the actual numbers of users which can use the program at any given time or on the actual use to which a program may be put. Furthermore it may be desirable to limit the use of the program to specified time periods. A problem arises particularly in digital data processing systems which have multiple users and or multiple processors namely managing use of licensed software to ensure that the use is within the terms of the license that is to ensure that the software is only used on identified processors or by the numbers of users permitted by the license.

A network environment for computers permits several computers or terminals to use or have access to one or more programs. Traditionally an end user would have to obtain a license from a software vendor to authorize use of the vendor s software on terminals or workstations within the network.

One method for providing access to software is known as the single CPU or single processor license wherein a software program is locked to a specific CPU and access to that software is only permitted from the particular licensed computer. A single CPU license may create instances where software is unavailable to all users because the computer is not functioning or because several users want to use the software at the same time. To assure wide access end users frequently must obtain unneeded CPU locked software to assure availability and convenience. Companies with but a few users of a particular software program generally choose a CPU locked system because it is in effect priced proportionately to the number of users.

The second general method to provide access to software is known as site licensing. With this method a software program is available for all the computers at an installation. The number of users who may run a software package concurrently under a site license is theoretically limited only by the number of users in the computing environment. Although site licensing may ease administrative and operational problems for an end user it normally does so at a premium price which takes into account the lack of accountability that such flexible licensing provides. A site license imposes unneeded costs where only a few users of a company actually need the software.

In the instance where a software vendor offers a choice between CPU locked and site licensed software it is the number of expected users at a purchasing company which affects the purchasing choice. If many of the end users at a company intend to use the software for example then a site license may be the most appropriate distribution system because it may be the low cost option. If the software only will be used by a few workers however then a CPU locked distribution system may be more appropriate. The trade off point is determined by the relative pricing between the two distribution systems.

For environments where many users need the software but only spend a portion of their time using it neither a dedicated CPU locked license nor a site license may be cost effective. In such a case a user who needs more than a single copy of the software may not buy it thus depriving a vendor of potential revenue. Similarly vendors lose potential revenue when they permit a company with a very large number of users to use software over an entire site due to a general lack of accountability.

As computers have proliferated in availability the investment in computer software has also grown and there have been developed various methods for charging the computer user for use of computer software products. Typically computer software products are licensed rather than sold to the computer user under various arrangements. The simplest common license arrangement gives the user the right to use a software product on a single computer i.e. to employ only one central processing unit CPU in connection with operation of the software product.

Although many such licenses are for indefinite periods of time a license may also be for a limited duration and extendable so that the entity marketing the product can charge a periodic fee for example annually for use of the software product. Or use may be absolutely time limited for example one day so that the user may evaluate the software product for possible purchase of a regular license. Since software can be copied and moved easily from one like machine to another companies have invented methods to prevent unauthorized use of their software products. Some licensors require passwords to activate software on a particular machine. The password may be keyed to the hardware s identification number as a condition for operation of the software. Such systems can effectively lock software to a particular machine but do not address software that is licensed for concurrent or simultaneous use. Some licensors use hardware locks that attach to a parallel printer port or a serial port on a machine each time the software is activated it looks for a specified code in the hardware lock as a condition for operation of the software. Using hardware locks resolves the problem of unauthorized moving of software among machines however hardware locks do not handle multiple software products on a single machine and they require time and expense to deliver to the end user.

When computer software products are used in a network environment which may include computers running in various roles as workstations and servers of various types linked together over a data path additional licensing challenges are present. For example a network may permit a user at one node which may be a terminal or workstation for instance to utilize a software product running at another node which may be the network server or even another workstation . Consequently the terms of the single computer type of software license might not cover the usage of the software product on the network or worse still from the point of view of the licensor might actually permit such a usage without additional compensation to the licensor. One approach to network licensing is to grant permission to use the program based on all of the nodes on the network and to require a license for each node. Then typically the license fee may be increased as the number of nodes on the network increases. Another approach bases the license fee for a software product running on a network on the total number of individual users who might actually run the software regardless of the number of nodes either on the network or running the software product at a given time. These approaches however have usually required the cooperation of the licensee because additional nodes may be added to the network or additional users may utilize the software without the knowledge of the licensor who is typically not present on the premises of the licensee. The licensor may reserve the right to audit the licensee s site but such an audit is intrusive expensive and may alienate potential or actual customers for licenses. Although other approaches exist under which one might charge a single fee per server or per site or per entity often on an individually negotiated basis these approaches are often impractical or inflexible in that they also typically do not take into account the possible wide variation over time in the number of nodes or users and also require reliance on licensee cooperation.

Recently it has become practical in some network environments to determine and limit the number of nodes that may access a software product at a given time and to charge a license fee based on the maximum number of nodes that are permitted to use the software product concurrently.

This is called concurrent licensing . In these environments a computer program acting as librarian and running on a computer node designated as a license server is typically used to distribute license keys sometimes called tokens over the network to nodes requesting access to run a software product the number of keys is tracked by the librarian and if at a given time the permitted maximum number of keys would be exceeded by usage of the software product on a requesting node the node can be denied at such time access to invoke the software product.

Examples of software based concurrent licensing arrangements may be found in Unix applications running in connection with software products sold under the trademarks NetLS available from Gradient Technologies Inc. 577 Main Street Suite 4 Hudson Mass. 01749 and SunLic available from Sun Microsystems Inc. Mountain View Calif. and Flexible License Manager available from Highland Software Inc. 1001 Elwell Court Palo Alto Calif. 94303 .

WAF can securely manage the integration of control information provided by two or more parties. As a result WAF can construct an electronic agreement between WAF participants that represent a negotiation between the control requirements of two or more parties and enacts terms and conditions of a resulting agreement. WAF ensures the rights of each party to an electronic agreement regarding a wide range of electronic activities related to electronic information and or appliance usage.

An important feature of WAF is that it can be used to assure the administration of and adequacy of security and rights protection for electronic agreements implemented through the use of the present invention. Such agreements may involve one or more of 

 3 users of other than financial service providers information arising from content usage such as content specific demographic information and user specific descriptive information. Such users may include market analysts marketing list compilers for direct and directed marketing and government agencies 4 end users of content 5 infrastructure service and device providers such as telecommunication companies and hardware manufacturers semiconductor and electronic appliance and or other computer system manufacturers who receive compensation based upon the use of their services and or devices and 6 certain parties described by electronic information.

WAF supports commercially secure extended value chain electronic agreements. WAF can be configured to support the various underlying agreements between parties that comprise this extended agreement. These agreements can define important electronic commerce considerations including 

 3 privacy regarding for example information concerning parties described by medical credit tax personal and or of other forms of confidential information 

 5 pathways of handling for electronic content content and or appliance control information electronic content and or appliance usage information and payment and or credit.

WAF agreements may define the electronic commerce relationship of two or more parties of a value chain but such agreements may at times not directly obligate or otherwise directly involve other WAF value chain participants. For example an electronic agreement between a content creator and a distributor may establish both the price to the distributor for a creator s content such as for a property distributed in a WAF container object and the number of copies of this object that this distributor may distribute to end users over a given period of time. In a second agreement a value chain end user may be involved in a three party agreement in which the end user agrees to certain requirements for using the distributed product such as accepting distributor charges for content use and agreeing to observe the copyright rights of the creator. A third agreement might exist between the distributor and a financial clearinghouse that allows the distributor to employ the clearinghouse s credit for payment for the product if the end user has a separate fourth agreement directly with the clearinghouse extending credit to the end user. A fifth evolving agreement may develop between all value chain participants as content control information passes along its chain of handling. This evolving agreement can establish the rights of all parties to content usage information including for example the nature of information to be received by each party and the pathway of handling of content usage information and related procedures. A sixth agreement in this example may involve all parties to the agreement and establishes certain general assumptions such as security techniques and degree of trustedness for example commercial integrity of the system may require each WAF installation secure subsystem to electronically warrant that their WAF node meets certain interoperability requirements . In the above example these six agreements could comprise agreements of an extended agreement for this commercial value chain instance.

WAF agreements support evolving living electronic agreement arrangements that can be modified by current and or new participants through very simple to sophisticated negotiations between newly proposed content control information interacting with control information already in place and or by negotiation between concurrently proposed content control information submitted by a plurality of parties. A given model may be asynchronously and progressively modified over time in accordance with existing senior rules and such modification may be applied to all to classes of and or to specific content and or to classes and or specific users and or user nodes. A given piece of content may be subject to different control information at different times or places of handling depending on the evolution of its content control information and or on differing applicable WAF installation content control information . The evolution of control information can occur during the passing along of one or more WAF control information containing objects that is control information may be modified at one or more points along a chain of control information handling so long as such modification is allowed. As a result WAF managed content may have different control information applied at both different locations in a chain of content handling and at similar locations in differing chains of the handling of such content. Such different application of control information may also result from content control information specifying that a certain party or group of parties shall be subject to content control information that differs from another party or group of parties. For example content control information for a given piece of content may be stipulated as senior information and therefore not changeable might be put in place by a content creator and might stipulate that national distributors of a given piece of their content may be permitted to make 100 000 copies per calendar quarter so long as such copies are provided to boni fide end users but may pass only a single copy of such content to a local retailers and the control information limits such a retailer to making no more than 1 000 copies per month for retail sales to end users. In addition for example an end user of such content might be limited by the same content control information to making three copies of such content one for each of three different computers he or she uses one desktop computer at work one for a desktop computer at home and one for a portable computer .

Electronic agreements supported by the preferred embodiment of the present invention can vary from very simple to very elaborate. They can support widely diverse information management models that provide for electronic information security usage administration and communication and may support 

 c secure financial transaction capabilities related to both electronic information and or appliance usage and other electronic credit and or currency usage and administration capabilities 

 2 one or more pathways chains for the handling of content content and or appliance control information reporting of content and or appliance usage related information and or payment 

 3 supporting an evolution of terms and conditions incorporated into content control information including use of electronic negotiation capabilities 

Referring to operation of a status of delivery is output for at least one of the products and services for which the order is received. The order status of a desired order may be checked in real time especially useful when products are backordered or services have been delayed. Once the items have been shipped the shipping status may be provided such as by requesting that the user input a tracking number and retrieving data concerning that number from the shipping provider and displaying the result. Further the status of an invoice may be checked in real time for for example permitting a user to determine whether a payment has been received and the like.

Any problems encountered relating to the order or shipping of the order are result in proactive notification of the problem to the user. As an option the history of previous orders and related delivery information may be provided.

Another aspect of the electronic commerce component of the present invention has the purpose of capturing interest in a product service or promotion. The invention sends leads notices and advertisements to sales effectiveness systems where the leads are displayed or disseminated to users. A database of the leads may be kept and updated as desired.

The electronic commerce component of the present invention may include an auction component for permitting a user to bid on an item against competing bidders. The auction component would permit private and public auctions and could even permit users to create their own auctions. The auction component should permit selection of an auction format from several different formats including for example Dutch and Reserve auctions. Further tracking and analysis of auction histories could also be provided.

Economic activity has at its centerpiece the buyer seller transaction for all goods and services produced and consumed in a market economy. It is the fundamental mechanism to which resources are allocated to producers and output to consumers. The operation of the buyer seller mechanism can and often is a critical determination of economic efficiency and when operated properly will substantially enhance market performance.

Through history there have been many different approaches adopted to fairly bring buyers and sellers together each with the key objective of permitting transactions at or as close as possible to the market price of the goods. By definition the market price is the price in given currency terms that a fully educated market given full access will transact select goods. This can only be accomplished by permitting full access to the transaction by essentially all potential buyers and sellers. However the buyer seller transaction must be structured to operate at very low costs or it will distort the market price of goods with the artificially high transactions costs. Thus as can be seen the two keys to effective buyer seller transactions full access and knowledge coupled with low costs can be and are often conflicting necessitating trade offs between trading efficiency and market knowledge.

One well known and particularly successful trading system is known as the open outcry auction . This involves a process wherein buyers and sellers collect in one location and prices for select goods are presented to the group through a broker via simple vocal offerings. This approach has been used for almost all kinds of goods but is particularly useful where there are no established trading locations or markets for the selected items. It is the dominate trading forum for exotic items such as rare pieces of art and the like. Although successful in bringing interested parties to the transaction the overall process can be very expensive adding significantly to the market distorting transaction costs.

Open outcry auction techniques modified over time have also found successful application in many commodity trading activities including the buying and selling of farm produce and livestock oil and commodities contracts future contracts on a variety of items and particularly germane to the present invention fixed income securities. These trading activities focus on the buying and selling of essentially fungible items that is items that are without meaningful differentiation from like items on the market. For example a bushel of wheat for February delivery is considered for sale and delivery at a price independent from its source. Similarly a 30 year treasury bond paying a coupon rate of 8 percent and having a July 1996 issue date is indistinguishable from other 30 year treasuries having the same properties. Accordingly the price buyers are willing to pay and sellers willing to accept defines the market price of all 30 year treasury bonds of that same vintage allowing a source transparent application of open outcry auction trading.

The fixed income securities issued by the United States Government are known as U.S. treasuries. These instruments typically span maturity terms at issue of 13 to 52 weeks T bills one to ten years notes and up to 30 years bonds . The T bills are pure discount securities having no coupons. Almost all other treasuries having longer terms are coupon notes or bonds with a defined payment cycle of semi annual payments to the holder.

Treasuries have characteristic properties that make them especially useful for the purpose of the present invention and therefore are used exclusively in the following discussions with the fundamental tenant that the principles may be applied to other types of fixed income securities without departing from the inventive concepts. One important attribute of treasuries in the context of the present invention is the minimal and uniform default risk the issuance of U.S. government paper removes the default risk as a defining criteria in the relative pricing of treasuries in the market place when they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

New treasury securities are auctioned by the U.S. government at preestablished auction dates. The auction prices for the treasuries having a face value with a set coupon rate will define the issuance yields of the security. After the auction the treasuries enter the secondary market and are traded typically over the counter i.e. without a defined exchange. As inflation expectations and supply and demand conditions change the prices of the recently auctioned treasuries fluctuate on the secondary market. These new prices are reflected by competing bid and ask prices communicated among institutions banks brokers and dealers in the secondary market. For example the yield of a treasury note increases as its price drops in the market typically reflecting an overall increase in the interest rates for that term of security.

The newly auctioned securities are traded with and in conjunction with the securities issued in earlier auctions. In this context some securities are traded more often than others and are called the actives the actives usually correspond to the recently issued securities as opposed to the older securities in the market. Indeed some older securities are infrequently traded creating an illiquid market that may or may not reflect the current market determined interest rate for that maturity length security.

As can be realized by the foregoing description the very size and diversity of the treasury market implicates an unprecedented level of sophistication by market participants in the bidding offering buying and selling transactions involving these securities. The very complexity associated with the transactions and the scale of trading undertaken by banks brokers dealers and institutional participants necessitates a rigidly structured approach to trading.

In the past open outcry auction bond brokering has served its customers well providing highly efficient executions at near perfect market pricing. The open outcry auction applied to bond trading was implemented by a broker working with a collection of customers to create and manage a market. Typical customer representatives both buyers and sellers at a common location e.g. a single room where the representatives of the customers would communicate with each other to develop pricing and confirm transactions. This process employed the expression by the representatives of various bid and offer prices for the fixed income security at select volumes i.e. how many million dollars of bonds at a given maturity . This expression would involve the loud oral cry of a customer proposed bid or offer and the coordination with the fellow representatives regarding the extraction of complimentary positions until a transaction match is made and a deal is done. This trade capture process relies on after the fact reporting of what just transpired through the oral outcry trade.

Recently the trade capture process was performed by having designated clerks input data into electronic input devices. An input clerk would attempt to interpret the open outcry of many individual brokers simultaneously who sequentially are making verbally known their trading instructions of their customers. The quality of the data capture was a function of the interpretative skill of the input clerk and the volume and the volatility of customer orders. A significant drawback to this type of auction data capture process is the difficulty in discerning the distinct trading instructions verbalized in rapid succession during a quickly moving market so that an accurate sequence of data can be captured by brokers and a set of inputters.

The many permutations of this process will be discussed in some detail below. At this juncture suffice to say that at the volumes of business transactions existing at the time of its development and the lack of suitable alternatives left this process as the dominate trading mechanism for decades. However successful this approach was not perfect. Indeed in recent years some of the problems in a open outcry auction forum have been amplified by the vastly increased level of trading now undertaken in the fixed income field. Without attempting to be comprehensive difficulties would occur by the injection of trader personalities into the open outcry auction process. For example an aggressive highly vocal representative may in fact dominate trading and transaction flow even though he she may only represent a smaller and less critical collection of customers. Although such aggressive actions at open outcry auction may be beneficial to those particular customers in the short run overall such dominance of the trading can and will distort pricing away from the actual market conditions.

Other problems exist in open outcry auction that deplete efficient trading. The speed at which trading flows and the oral nature of the auction process injects a potential for human error that often translates into many millions of dollars committed to trades unrelated to customer objectives. As such the broker is left at the end of each trading day with a reconciliation process that may under certain market conditions wipe out all associated profit from that day s trading. Also customers may quickly change direction regarding trading based on new information available to the market. Shifting position or backing out of previously committed transactions on very short notice is often very difficult in the traditional open outcry auction process.

First in brief overview the present invention is directed to a data processing system for implementing complex trading rules in support of select transactions. The first aspect of the invention relates to a particular hardware arrangement that provides a specifically tailored platform for processor enhanced and supported trading. This hardware arrangement encompasses a plurality of custom designed workstations linked together for communication. Each workstation is linked to a central server that orchestrates the trading processes in accordance with program controlled logic. The workstation includes a display for presentation of the particulars of trading activity. A customized keypad permits enhanced data position entry by the broker.

The second aspect of the invention is the governing logic for controlling system dynamics. This logic is stored in system memory and provides the sequence of protocols and rules that allocate trading priority and the system responses to operative commands entered by the brokers at the workstations. The system logic is critical on two levels. First it is important as the guiding principles underlying the system and thus performance is tied directly thereto. On a second level system logic must be known to all customers and traders as the rules dictating market access and response to eliminate any confusion and to place participants on as close to an equal footing as possible. It is a fundamental precept of the present system to provide fair and complete access to the trading process to all registered participants.

To better appreciate the following details a review of the nomenclature employed is recommended. The illustrative examples herein all focus on fixed income instruments and trading of these instruments in large volumes with the volume of a given transaction delineated in dollars e.g. 25 million of 10 year treasuries .

The general context of system operation is based on the repetitive operation of several functions and in its preferred embodiment implements these functions through a specially designed keypad. Generally the process begins when customers contact the brokers and place bids and offers for a defined class of instruments. These various positions are displayed on the computer terminal in specific ways to reflect priority etc. A customer can establish trading priority by placing a bid or offer at a select price and volume bids at the same price are displayed on the screen in time order in which they enter the system as are offers . As such a queue of bids and offers develops with place in line set by time at the same price. This queue is displayed on screen at the broker s workstation. Typically there is a small difference between the bid price and offer price the spread . If no difference exists this is known as a locked market.

Importantly a bid and offer are commitments once placed a bid can be hit and an offer can be lifted by a customer willing to trade the instrument at the set price.

To control trading between many participating customers some level of hierarchy is set. A customer who hits on a bid or lifts an offer is promoted to a new level known as the aggressor . By acting on a bid or offer the aggressor defines and thus establishes the active side of the trade. For example if the customer hits a bid selling becomes the active side of the trade and buying turns passive. However if the customer lifts an offer buying is active. This is an important practical consideration as by convention the active side pays commissions on the ensuing transactions. This allocation of commissions is premised on the notion that the active customers are taking advantage of liquidity while the passive side is supplying liquidity to the market.

For controlled implementation the above noted delineation between active and passive sides is important and carries more significance in processing transactions than the different sides of the transaction i.e. the bid and offer.

Focusing further on the nomenclature for the system logic a trade is considered a sequence of trading events triggered by the initial hit or lift that defines the aggressor and continues for all such transactions until the trade clears . During a trade the aggressor side remains active and all transactions take place at the price set by the initial hit or lift regardless of the number of following transactions. To properly track activity a trade generates a virtual and or real single trade ticket with associated and screen displayed reference number.

Testing the content of the data interface may include comparing versions of the data interface and utilizing remote and automatic testing capabilities.

A fundamental problem for electronic content providers is extending their ability to control the use of proprietary information. Content providers often need to limit use to authorized activities and amounts. Participants in a business model involving for example provision of movies and advertising on optical discs may include actors directors script and other writers musicians studios publishers distributors retailers advertisers credit card services and content end users. These participants need the ability to embody their range of agreements and requirements including use limitations into an extended agreement comprising an overall electronic business model. This extended agreement is represented by electronic content control information that can automatically enforce agreed upon rights and obligations. Under WAF such an extended agreement may comprise an electronic contract involving all business model participants. Such an agreement may alternatively or in addition be made up of electronic agreements between subsets of the business model participants. Through the use of WAF electronic commerce can function in the same way as traditional commerce that is commercial relationships regarding products and services can be shaped through the negotiation of one or more agreements between a variety of parties.

Commercial content providers are concerned with ensuring proper compensation for the use of their electronic information. Electronic digital information for example a CD recording can today be copied relatively easily and inexpensively. Similarly unauthorized copying and use of software programs deprives rightful owners of billions of dollars in annual revenue according to the International Intellectual Property Alliance. Content providers and distributors have devised a number of limited function rights protection mechanisms to protect their rights. Authorization passwords and protocols license servers lock unlock distribution methods and non electronic contractual limitations imposed on users of shrink wrapped software are a few of the more prevalent content protection schemes. In a commercial context these efforts are inefficient and limited solutions.

Providers of electronic currency have also created protections for their type of content. These systems are not sufficiently adaptable efficient nor flexible enough to support the generalized use of electronic currency. Furthermore they do not provide sophisticated auditing and control configuration capabilities. This means that current electronic currency tools lack the sophistication needed for many real world financial business models. WAF provides means for anonymous currency and for conditionally anonymous currency wherein currency related activities remain anonymous except under special circumstances.

WAF allows the owners and distributors of electronic digital information to reliably bill for and securely control audit and budget the use of electronic information. It can reliably detect and monitor the use of commercial information products. WAF uses a wide variety of different electronic information delivery means including for example digital networks digital broadcast and physical storage media such as optical and magnetic disks. WAF can be used by major network providers hardware manufacturers owners of electronic information providers of such information and clearinghouses that gather usage information regarding and bill for the use of electronic information.

WAF provides comprehensive and configurable transaction management metering and monitoring technology. It can change how electronic information products are protected marketed packaged and distributed. When used WAF should result in higher revenues for information providers and greater user satisfaction and value. Use of WAF will normally result in lower usage costs decreased transaction costs more efficient access to electronic information re usability of rights protection and other transaction management implementations greatly improved flexibility in the use of secured information and greater standardization of tools and processes for electronic transaction management. WAF can be used to create an adaptable environment that fulfills the needs of electronic information owners distributors and users financial clearinghouses and usage information analyzers and resellers.

WAF provides a secure distributed electronic transaction management system for controlling the distribution and or other usage of electronically provided and or stored information. WAF controls auditing and reporting of electronic content and or appliance usage. Users of WAF may include content creators who apply content usage usage reporting and or usage payment related control information to electronic content and or appliances for users such as end user organizations individuals and content and or appliance distributors. WAF also securely supports the payment of money owed including money owed for content and or appliance usage by one or more parties to one or more other parties in the form of electronic credit and or currency.

WAF may be used to migrate most non electronic traditional information delivery models including entertainment reference materials catalog shopping etc. into an adequately secure digital distribution and usage management and payment context. The distribution and financial pathways managed by a WAF arrangement may include 

other parties interested in the user usage of information securely delivered and or stored using WAF.

Normally participants in a WAF arrangement will employ the same secure WAF foundation. Alternate embodiments support WAF arrangements employing differing WAF foundations. Such alternate embodiments may employ procedures to ensure certain interoperability requirements are met.

Because of the breadth of issues resolved by the present invention it can provide the emerging electronic highway with a single transaction distribution control system that can for a very broad range of commercial and data security models ensure against unauthorized use of confidential and or proprietary information and commercial electronic transactions. WAF s electronic transaction management mechanisms can enforce the electronic rights and agreements of all parties participating in widely varying business and data security models and this can be efficiently achieved through a single WAF implementation within each WAF participant s electronic appliance. WAF supports widely varying business and or data security models that can involve a broad range of participants at various levels of WAF content and or content control information pathways of handling. Different content control and or auditing models and agreements may be available on the same WAF installation. These models and agreements may control content in relationship to for example WAF installations and or users in general certain specific users installations classes and or other groupings of installations and or users as well as to electronic content generally on a given installation to specific properties property portions classes and or other groupings of content.

Distribution using WAF may package both the electronic content and control information into the same WAF container and or may involve the delivery to an end user site of different pieces of the same WAF managed property from plural separate remote locations and or in plural separate WAF content containers and or employing plural different delivery means. Content control information may be partially or fully delivered separately from its associated content to a user WAF installation in one or more WAF administrative objects. Portions of said control information may be delivered from one or more sources. Control information may also be available for use by access from a user s WAF installation secure sub system to one or more remote WAF secure sub systems and or WAF compatible certified secure remote locations. WAF control processes such as metering budgeting decrypting and or fingerprinting may as relates to a certain user content usage activity be performed in a user s local WAF installation secure subsystem or said processes may be divided amongst plural secure subsystems which may be located in the same user WAF installations and or in a network server and in the user installation. For example a local WAF installation may perform decryption and save any or all of usage metering information related to content and or electronic appliance usage at such user installation could be performed at the server employing secure e.g. encrypted communications between said secure subsystems. Said server location may also be used for near real time frequent or more periodic secure receipt of content usage information from said user installation with for example metered information being maintained only temporarily at a local user installation.

Delivery means for WAF managed content may include electronic data storage means such as optical disks for delivering one portion of said information and broadcasting and or telecommunicating means for other portions of said information. Electronic data storage means may include magnetic media optical media combined magneto optical systems flash RAM memory bubble memory and or other memory storage means such as huge capacity optical storage systems employing holographic frequency and or polarity data storage techniques. Data storage means may also employ layered disc techniques such as the use of generally transparent and or translucent materials that pass light through layers of data carrying discs which themselves are physically packaged together as one thicker disc. Data carrying locations on such discs may be at least in part opaque.

WAF control information e.g. methods that collectively control use of WAF managed properties database document individual commercial product are either shipped with the content itself for example in a content container and or one or more portions of such control information is shipped to distributors and or other users in separably deliverable administrative objects. A subset of the methods for a property may in part be delivered with each property while one or more other subsets of methods can be delivered separately to a user or otherwise made available for use such as being available remotely by telecommunication means . Required methods methods listed as required for property and or appliance use must be available as specified if WAF controlled content such as intellectual property distributed within a WAF content container is to be used. Methods that control content may apply to a plurality of WAF container objects such as a class or other grouping of such objects. Methods may also be required by certain users or classes of users and or WAF installations and or classes of installations for such parties to use one or more specific or classes of objects.

A feature of WAF provided by the present invention is that certain one or more methods can be specified as required in order for a WAF installation and or user to be able to use certain and or all content. For example a distributor of a certain type of content might be allowed by senior participants by content creators for example to require a method which prohibits end users from electronically saving decrypted content a provider of credit for WAF transactions might require an audit method that records the time of an electronic purchase and or a user might require a method that summarizes usage information for reporting to a clearinghouse e.g. billing information in a way that does not convey confidential personal information regarding detailed usage behavior.

A further feature of WAF provided by the present invention is that creators distributors and users of content can select from among a set of predefined methods if available to control container content usage and distribution functions and or they may have the right to provide new customized methods to control at least certain usage functions such new methods may be required to be certified for trustedness and interoperability to the WAF installation and or for of a group of WAF applications . As a result WAF provides a very high degree of configurability with respect to how the distribution and other usage of each property or object or one or more portions of objects or properties as desired and or applicable will be controlled. Each WAF participant in a WAF pathway of content control information may set methods for some or all of the content in a WAF container so long as such control information does not conflict with senior control information already in place with respect to 

For example a content creator s WAF control information for certain content can take precedence over other submitted WAF participant control information and for example if allowed by senior control information a content distributor s control information may itself take precedence over a client administrator s control information which may take precedence over an end user s control information. A path of distribution participant s ability to set such electronic content control information can be limited to certain control information for example method mediating data such as pricing and or sales dates or it may be limited only to the extent that one or more of the participant s proposed control information conflicts with control information set by senior control information submitted previously by participants in a chain of handling of the property or managed in said participant s WAF secure subsystem.

WAF control information may in part or in full a represent control information directly put in place by WAF content control information pathway participants and or b comprise control information put in place by such a participant on behalf of a party who does not directly handle electronic content or electronic appliance permissions records information for example control information inserted by a participant on behalf of a financial clearinghouse or government agency . Such control information methods and or load modules and or mediating data and or component assemblies may also be put in place by either an electronic automated or a semi automated and human assisted control information control set negotiating process that assesses whether the use of one or more pieces of submitted control information will be integrated into and or replace existing control information and or chooses between alternative control information based upon interaction with in place control information and how such control information may be used.

Control information may be provided by a party who does not directly participate in the handling of electronic content and or appliance and or control information for such content and or appliance . Such control information may be provided in secure form using WAF installation secure sub system managed communications including for example authenticating the deliverer of at least in part encrypted control information between such not directly participating one or more parties WAF installation secure subsystems and a pathway of WAF content control information participant s WAF installation secure subsystem. This control information may relate to for example the right to access credit supplied by a financial services provider the enforcement of regulations or laws enacted by a government agency or the requirements of a customer of WAF managed content usage information reflecting usage of content by one or more parties other than such customer relating to the creation handling and or manner of reporting of usage information received by such customer. Such control information may for example enforce societal requirements such as laws related to electronic commerce.

WAF content control information may apply differently to different pathway of content and or control information handling participants. Furthermore permissions records rights may be added altered and or removed by a WAF participant if they are allowed to take such action. Rights of WAF participants may be defined in relation to specific parties and or categories of parties and or other groups of parties in a chain of handling of content and or content control information e.g. permissions records . Modifications to control information that may be made by a given eligible party or parties may be limited in the number of modifications and or degree of modification they may make.

At least one secure subsystem in electronic appliances of creators distributors auditors clearinghouses client administrators and end users understanding that two or more of the above classifications may describe a single user provides a sufficiently secure for the intended applications environment for 

4. Processing core control programs along with associated data that constitute control information for electronic content and or appliance rights protection including the enforcing of preferences and requirements of WAF participants.

Normally most usage audit reporting payment and distribution control methods are themselves at least in part encrypted and are executed by the secure subsystem of a WAF installation. Thus for example billing and metering records can be securely generated and updated and encryption and decryption keys are securely utilized within a secure subsystem. Since WAF also employs secure e.g. encrypted and authenticated communications when passing information between the participant location nodes secure subsystems of a WAF arrangement important components of a WAF electronic agreement can be reliably enforced with sufficient security sufficiently trusted for the intended commercial purposes. A WAF electronic agreement for a value chain can be composed at least in part of one or more subagreements between one or more subsets of the value chain participants. These subagreements are comprised of one or more electronic contract compliance elements methods including associated parameter data that ensure the protection of the rights of WAF participants.

The degree of trustedness of a WAF arrangement will be primarily based on whether hardware SPUs are employed at participant location secure subsystems and the effectiveness of the SPU hardware security architecture software security techniques when an SPU is emulated in software and the encryption algorithm s and keys that are employed for securing content control information communications and access to WAF node WAF installation secure subsystems. Physical facility and user identity authentication security procedures may be used instead of hardware SPUs at certain nodes such as at an established financial clearinghouse where such procedures may provide sufficient security for trusted interoperability with a WAF arrangement employing hardware SPUs at user nodes.

The updating of property management files at each location of a WAF arrangement to accommodate new or modified control information is performed in the WAF secure subsystem and under the control of secure management file updating programs executed by the protected subsystem. Since all secure communications are at least in part encrypted and the processing inside the secure subsystem is concealed from outside observation and interference the present invention ensures that content control information can be enforced. As a result the creator and or distributor and or client administrator and or other contributor of secure control information for each property for example an end user restricting the kind of audit information he or she will allow to be reported and or a financial clearinghouse establishing certain criteria for use of its credit for payment for use of distributed content can be confident that their contributed and accepted control information will be enforced within the security limitations of a given WAF security implementation design . This control information can determine for example 

 1 How and or to whom electronic content can be provided for example how an electronic property can be distributed 

 2 How one or more objects and or properties or portions of an object or property can be directly used such as decrypted displayed printed etc 

 4 How audit information about usage information related to at least a portion of a property should be collected reported and or used.

Seniority of contributed control information including resolution of conflicts between content control information submitted by multiple parties is normally established by 

 1 the sequence in which control information is put in place by various parties in place control information normally takes precedence over subsequently submitted control information 

 2 the specifics of WAF content and or appliance control information. For example in place control information can stipulate which subsequent one or more piece of control from one or more parties or class of parties will take precedence over control information submitted by one or more yet different parties and or classes of parties and or 3 negotiation between control information sets from plural parties which negotiation establishes what control information shall constitute the resulting control information set for a given piece of WAF managed content and or WAF installation.

Optionally the testing environment may be integrated with the content approval process to ensure compliance with content guidelines before actual deployment of the content.

One embodiment of the present invention is provided for affording a combination of education related web application services illustrated as component of . provides more detail. In operations and respectively a curriculum of course offerings is generated from which users are permitted to select i.e. order register etc. Education such as training or the like is carried out over a network such as the Internet in operation . At any given time a status of the education may be provided including such things as a listing of the courses completed scores for the courses completed a listing of courses for which currently enrolled and the current scores in those courses a listing of courses required to matriculate etc. Note operation .

Many school systems have become highly centralized. Large schools have evolved which serve wide geographic areas. The geographic area covered by some schools is so wide that certain students must make a round trip of one hundred miles or more to attend classes.

One benefit of a large centralized school is that a vast diverse curriculum can be offered. It is desirable to offer the diverse curriculum without imposing the long distance travel on students.

In one form of the invention a system of computers store lessons which are transmitted to computers used by students. At intervals the invention assess the students progress and selects appropriate lessons for the student at the time.

REPOSITORIES hold educational computer programs. Students obtain access to the programs needed via the NETWORK indicated. The programs instruct the students in an interactive manner.

The students need not be present at the REPOSITORIES but station themselves at convenient locations such as their homes thereby eliminating the need to travel to a physical facility to attend classes.

The teaching programs themselves are commercially available and new programs will be developed as systems such as the present invention become more widely implemented.

Programs which test students in order to determine the students master of material are also commercially available.

The invention provides several highly innovative features which significantly enhance the effectiveness of these teaching programs and testing programs.

One is that a PROFILE is generated for each student. PROFILES are discussed in the Related Applications. As adapted to the present invention the PROFILE is in simple terms a description of a the present educational status b the educational needs and c the educational capabilities of the student.

Educational status refers to the student s present position in the student s educational career. For example third month secondary school freshman is one status.

The invention uses the educational status in deciding what material to present the student at a given time as discussed more fully below.

Educational needs refer to the instruction needed by the student at the time which is largely determined by the student s curriculum. For example the lessons needed by a college sophomore having a curriculum of college chemistry with emphasis on organic synthesis are known.

Educational characteristics refer to the manner of teaching to which the student best responds. That is the invention identifies learning characteristics of each student and presents material in a manner compatible with the characteristics.

As a simple example some students can understand the Pythagorean Theorem directly from its mathematical statement namely 

Other students do not obtain information from such an abstract statement and must see the Theorem applied to specific examples before they understand it.

The preferred learning styles are ascertained by a combination of student counselor interviews computer assisted examination of the student and standard psychological assessment.

The invention uses the PROFILES to select material to present to the student during each session. The PROFILE is updated if required at each students learning session to indicate progress made during the session. This updating is automatic and done non intrusively.

The invention includes educational programs which present a given lesson in different ways in order to accommodate the fact that different students assimilate material in different ways. This collection of different presentations allows implementation of two teaching approaches.

As discussed immediately above because different students have different learning characteristics the invention selects a suitable manner of presentation from the collection based on the learning characteristics of the student. The selection is made based on the PROFILE.

The collection of presentations can be used to offer different presentations to a given student if the student fails to master a lesson when presented the first time. Three reasons exist which indicate that this approach may be desirable.

One it is expected that a given student does not maintain constant learning characteristics at all times.

Two the characterization of learning style of a student is not a perfect science. Thus even if the learning characteristics never change it is not clear that a perfect match can always be made between a style of presentation and the learning characteristics of the student.

Three even if the classification of learning style becomes perfected the subject matter of some lessons may not be amenable to the learning style preferred by the student. For example there exists a left brain right brain conception of human thinking wherein the left brain is believed to manage logic and the right brain manages creativity and imagery.

For a right brain student there may exist no directly compatible teaching strategy for explaining left brain subject matter. For instance there may be no perfectly compatible teaching strategy to explain the principles of artistic color theory to a right brain student undertaking a curriculum of nuclear physics.

Therefore the invention presents a given lesson in successive different ways if the student does not master the lesson the first time.

If a student fails to demonstrate mastery of a lesson after a prescribed number of attempts the invention establishes a video conference between the student and a SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT. The SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT is a consultant who is expert in the subject matter of the lesson causing difficulty. The video conference allows the SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT to identify the difficulties encountered by the student and to offer coaching.

Establishment of the video conference is allowed by commercially available systems such as the CLS system described below and also described in the Related Applications.

CLS places no geographic restriction on the location of the SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT except that the expert must be able to establish a communication link with the system. With no such restrictions the SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT can be located anywhere in the world. This feature allows Subject Matter Experts of the highest caliber to be obtained because such experts are a rare species and not easily located.

An INTELLIGENT ADMINISTRATOR IA taking the form of a system of programs and computer objects organizes the instructional activity. The IA does the following examines the PROFILE of each student selects the proper lessons for each session administers examinations to the students updates the PROFILE and patches up the student with a SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT when necessary. In addition the IA assesses the performance of the student in a continual and non intrusive manner.

The IA itself can call upon its own SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS when it encounters a condition which its programming and organization cannot handle.

The invention can be utilized in conjunction with the information management system sold under the trade name Continuous Learning System CLS and available from AT T Global Information Solutions Company Dayton Ohio. CLS provides the systems to allow the remote access and video conferencing described above.

This discussion will explain some of the relevant features of CLS and will then consider in greater detail the PROFILES and the IA.

1. CLS Uses Multiple Linked Computers. In CLS users interact with micro computers such as the well known highly advanced and inexpensive Personal Computer PC . The micro computers are located at locations of the users preference such as their homes offices or vehicles. The micro computers connect with CLS by data links such as private or public data networks or by commercially available telephone channels.

The links can take the form of traditional hard wired telephone channels or wireless links such as provided by cellular telephone service.

2. CLS Has Vast Storage Capability. Entire Curriculum can be Stored. CLS acts as a storage facility for materials which are generically called RESOURCES.

RESOURCES can be classified into two types namely a those which are downloadable and b those which are not. Two examples of downloadable RESOURCES are a a computer program and b a file stored on a mass storage medium such as a disc or tape drive. Two examples of RESOURCES which are NOT downloadable are a a 35 mm film and b a book in paper format.

RESOURCES consist of anything which has potential value in terms of recovering knowledge. RESOURCEs include for example information which can be downloaded such as data files computer applications computer managed instruction. RESOURCES also include SYSTEMS such as the commercially available information services known as CompuServe and Prodigy because these SYSTEMS allow recovery of knowledge. Subject Matter Experts are also RESOURCES. RESOURCES can be classified in a different way namely as either static or dynamic. The RESOURCES discussed above are of the static type because at the time of recovery they are pre existing.

Dynamic RESOURCES are not pre existing at the time of recovery but come into existence at the time of recovery. For example when television news media cover an event in real time such as the State of the Union Address of the President of the United States information contained in the Address becomes available for recovery if the news media is linkable to CLS or an equivalent . The information was not pre existing but came into existence at the time recovery became possible. Of course there is an extremely short time delay between the time of the Address and time recovery becomes possible. This time is considered negligible and does not render the Address pre existing. 

In general it is expected that the invention will utilize downloadable RESOURCES primarily. However because the vast storage ability allows the invention to hold a curriculum of truly immense proportions it is expected that many educational courses will refer to materials which cannot be rendered into downloadable format for reasons such as copyright laws. For such courses the automated retrieval capabilities of CLS become significant. These features are described in the Related Applications.

Storage facilities in CLS are called REPOSITORIES. A REPOSITORY includes one micro computer or a group of micro computers at a single location. REPOSITORIES can also contain more advanced computers such as main frames and mini computers. The REPOSITORIES themselves can be distributed over an extremely wide geographic area they can be spread world wide. As a result the RESOURCES will likewise be widely distributed because they are stored in the REPOSITORIES.

However despite this geographically distributed storage of RESOURCES and despite the vast total storage capability of the overall system CLS allows the user to deal with all downloadable RESOURCES as though physically present on the user s computer. That is in effect the user sees all RESOURCES no matter where located as though located in the storage devices of the user s own computer.

Therefore several school districts can maintain their own REPOSITORIES. However because the REPOSITORIES are linked by CLS to the student all RESOURCES appear to be located at a single convenient location. Of course under CLS the student can if desired ascertain the fact that the RESOURCES reside in different REPOSITORIES and are not in fact located at a single place. 

3. CLS Has Database Characteristics. CLS can be viewed as a type of database but with several distinguishing features. One the storage capacity of CLS is for practical purposes without limitation. One reason is that the architecture of CLS centers upon the PC. Expansion of storage in PCs is simple and inexpensive. Further additional PCs can be added to CLS with little or no software modification CLS is designed to accommodate this expansion. Stated in other words the PCs are directly concatenable. In principle there is no practical limit to the amount of storage available.

A second feature is that CLS allows a user to see a list of RESOURCES to which the user is allowed access and allows the user to select a RESOURCE. If the RESOURCE is a computer program or other object that runs on a processor CLS retrieves the selected RESOURCE and launches it.

In the present context this feature is important because the RESOURCES include educational computer programs as discussed below. When the student or the INTELLIGENT ADMINISTRATOR selects a RESOURCE CLS automatically launches it if possible.

4. CUSTODIAN of Each REPOSITORY Controls Contents ie Resources of REPOSITORY and Controls Access to RESOURCES Contained within the REPOSITORY. The person or agency having physical custody of each REPOSITORY has the power to load RESOURCES into storage within the computers of the REPOSITORY. Thus the CUSTODIAN controls the contents of the REPOSITORY. Further CLS allows the CUSTODIAN to designate the parties who shall be granted access to each RESOURCE.

Under the present invention a local school district for example will control the RESOURCES which contain the curriculum for the students. This school district will control access to the RESOURCES and can grant access to students of other districts if desired.

5. Each RESOURCE Has a PROFILE. A RESOURCE PROFILE is a collection of information which describes a RESOURCE. The PROFILE contains for example 

c information about physical characteristics of the RESOURCE media type such as computer disc video tape paper book etc. 

The PROFILEs are somewhat analogous to the cards of the card catalog of a library. In a library the books and other media such as film and video tape constitute RESOURCEs. In CLS the RESOURCEs include a more diverse array of media types than a library but the PROFILEs serve a function similar to that of the cards.

A LEARNING PROFILE is generated for each student in a manner discussed in greater detail below and these are called LEARNING PROFILES to distinguish them from RESOURCE PROFILES which describe RESOURCES and not students. The LEARNING PROFILEs conform to the PROFILEs used by CLS for RESOURCEs generally. The student PROFILEs contain information about the student which is relevant to the INTELLIGENT ADMINISTRATOR. The LEARNING PROFILES can be arranged to follow the students through their entire careers subject to legislation regarding privacy of the content of the LEARNING PROFILES.

The LEARNING PROFILE can be created in numerous different ways. For example standard psychological testing techniques and personal interviews can allow a counsellor to generate a LEARNING PROFILE which is loaded into CLS.

As another example CLS itself can administer known standard tests and develop the LEARNING PROFILEs without intervention of a counsellor. In practice the LEARNING PROFILE generation will probably be undertaken in a procedure which is a hybrid of these two examples. At the end of the Specification a discussion is given regarding learning strategies and contains additional material relevant to LEARNING PROFILE generation.

1. Student s curriculum or major. One benefit of the invention is that all students at all levels can be given individualized attention. Even very young students can be given a major if desirable.

That is in present educational systems younger students such as those in the earlier years of primary education are usually not given specific curricula. For these students education tends to be non specialized and generic all students tend to be given similar courses.

The invention allows education to be tailored to individual needs at all educational levels. One reason is reduction in cost the invention contains the vast array of lessons needed to provide individual attention. There is very little added cost in making the individual attention available to additional students.

2. Preferred teaching strategies. At the end of the Specification teaching strategies are discussed. In general different teaching strategies are available for most if not all subjects. As an example the Suzuki method of teaching piano illustrates one teaching strategy.

Under this strategy students listen to recordings of piano music played by a master and then imitate the master by playing the music themselves while reading sheet scores of the music. While the student plays a teacher coaches the student. Right from the start the student plays complete though simple songs.

In contrast under another method the student does not initially study complete songs but instead studies the components of songs namely single notes their duration their intensity and so on.

Both methods have their advocates and critics. Without considering the debate itself it seems reasonable to assume that neither method is perfectly suited to all students.

The invention if called upon to teach piano would recognize this fact. Under the invention each student s PROFILE contains an indication of the student s preference such as for the Suzuki method or another approach and the student is instructed accordingly.

3. Student s present standing. The PROFILEs contain a statement of the student s previous accomplishments which indicate the student s present standing or status. From a lifetime viewpoint the present standing refers to the present educational level of the student such as fifth grade or college sophomore.

From a more focused viewpoint the present standing refers to the courses presently being taken and the progress made in each. For example in a high school course in algebra containing 60 lessons the present standing will indicate the number of lessons successfully completed.

The present standing provides specific information for CLS to use in determining what material to present to a student during a given session.

The present standing is preferably ascertained in a non intrusive transparent manner based on a demonstration of level of competency by the student. Level of competency can be determined in many if not most subjects by assessment in a hierarchical fashion. For example assume that a given student is undertaking a course in calculus. Calculus textbooks present material in a sequential manner in the sense that mastery of earlier material is required as a prerequisite to understanding later material. A simple assessment of level of competency of a student can be done by determining in which chapter of the textbook the student s mastery ends.

As another example assume that the student is undertaking a course in gas turbine engine maintenance. Many maintenance procedures involve sequences of events wherein the order cannot be changed. A student s level of competency can be assessed by determining how much of a given sequence the student has mastered.

It is significant that the source of a student s knowledge which determine the level of competence is not germane to the assessment process. The assessment process seeks to determine a level of performance or level of competency because the goal of the overall education process is to enhance ability to perform.

4. Significant personalized information. This is perhaps a sub class of preferred teaching strategies. This section contains information about unique attributes of the student which either present difficulties in teaching the student or facilitate teaching.

For example a student who has a hearing impairment may require special lessons as compared with a student having hearing abilities within the norm of a standard population. As another example a student who has a photographic memory may find that learning the vocabulary of a foreign language is an extremely simple task.

The PROFILEs in general facilitate the IA s matching of the students needs with the RESOURCEs which are suited to those needs. The PROFILEs contain information such as that described above plus additional information required to accomplish this goal.

In general RESOURCEs include all materials made available by CLS. In the context of education RESOURCEs include a significant number of computer programs which teach. There are numerous types of such programs and hundreds and perhaps thousands are commercially available today.

The Intelligent Administrator IA is a system of computer programs which can operate alone or in conjunction with an SME or other consultant. The IA does the following 

1. Based on PROFILEs the IA assesses a student s current standing within a curriculum and determines the skills required for the student s present advancement.

For example the IA may determine that a given student stands at the beginning of the junior year in high school and that the student has successfully completed 12 of 60 lessons in analytic geometry. Based on this assessment the IA decides that lesson number 13 should be given next.

2. The IA locates the RESOURCEs necessary for the required lessons. In this example the IA would locate lesson 13 identified above. Lesson 13 will probably reside in the local school district s REPOSITORY but because of the capabilities of CLS lesson 13 can reside anywhere within the overall CLS system.

Since multiple teaching strategies are available and are used if the first chosen strategy does not produce results the IA locates the multiple RESOURCEs which represent the multiple strategies. In the general case these RESOURCEs will not be located in the same REPOSITORY although they can be. 

3. The IA assesses whether the RESOURCEs are successfully imparting the knowledge desired to the students. This assessment can be done by using known standardized testing approaches given by computer.

1. Different presentation of a given lesson was discussed above. In the section entitled Teaching Strategies Generally located below references are discussed which elaborate on the concept of different learning behavior of different students. These references provide the general principles of creating different presentations.

A more rote minded approach would be based on the fact that different teachers themselves probably make different presentations of a given topic. Therefore one approach to generating the different presentations is to assign a number of teachers say ten the task of each writing a lesson explaining a topic. The ten different lessons will provide ten different presentations for the collection of presentations.

2. The invention measures the rate of learning of the student and prompt the student to end a lesson when the rate is seen to significantly falter. For example suppose that a student is studying a subject which is memorization intensive such as biology. The lessons can be arranged such that learning is presented in groups of twenty concepts. After each group of twenty is presented an assessment of the student is done.

The IA logs the time required by the student to learn each group. When the time falls below the best time by a predetermined amount say thirty percent the IA attempts a different teaching strategy. If that fails after a predetermined number of attempts then the IA patches the student into a Subject Matter Expert.

b The educational programs including the different presentations of a given subject which are commercially available or can be developed based on known principles.

The details concerning implementation of the INTELLIGENT ADMINISTRATOR are known given the mission of the IA as described herein.

4. The video conferencing feature of CLS allows a SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT to teach small groups of students and the students to confer with each other. As an example after students in an ordinary school take an examination many of them congregate and compare opinions on the exam. Under the invention similar behavior is possible but by way of video conferencing.

5. The distributed aspect of learning is important. A student can undertake learning at any location provided a Communicator is available to link with CLS or an equivalent.

For example a newly hired business person must learn certain internal procedures followed within the hiring organization such as filling out expense account forms. It is known in the art how to write a program which explains how to fill out such a form. In a highly simplistic sense the program can merely repeat the text of written instructions which undoubtedly have been written. 

This instructional program is made available via CLS. The business person can now learn how to fill out the expense form using a Communicator such as a PC and a modem at any desired location such as in a waiting lounge at an airport. Then having mastered the procedure the person can fill out needed forms at any location whatsoever provided a link to CLS or to an equivalent is available.

6. Two learning styles are discussed herein namely holistic and linear. There exist other distinctions in approaches to explaining subject matter to a student. Three examples are the following.

A. Some students prefer to read material others prefer to hear an explanation of material spoken by a teacher.

B. Some students prefer to have material presented in a verbal format either in writing which is read or in speech which is heard . Other students prefer to have material presented in graphical format. A good example of this distinction is found in Gray s Anatomy. Two versions exist there is a version which is primarily textual and contains few pictures. There is another version which is primarily graphical and is replete with pictures. C. When technique is being taught some students prefer to see a demonstration others prefer to hear a description of the principles of that demonstration. Profiles and Learning Strategies One Approach to Developing a Learning Profile

The invention obtains necessary data from the student such as name age and previous learning completed in school. This information allows the AI to place the student in the proper grade.

The invention then ascertains the student s preferred learning style through an entry adventure. Different adventures will be given to students of different age so the age or last grade completed will influence the choice of entry adventure presented to the student. 

Each student can take a new entry adventure every year to ascertain whether the learning characteristics have changed. Also since girls and boys differ in their intellectual and social development and since the entry adventure should catch their interest and create enthusiasm for the coming year s studies different versions will be used for boys and girls.

In this adventure students solve a problem or pursue an adventure. The choices made indicate their comprehension speed and favored style of learning.

The student s learning speed can be measured by how long it takes a student to solve a given problem or to perform an assigned task. Several problems will be embedded in the adventure the problems will provide information and then require the student to apply it in situations which require different levels of complexity and integration. The invention can tally the total time elapsed for the student to solve the problems and compare the total to the norm for that grade in the student s school district or region. This learning speed measure is different from IQ measurement research has shown that even above average students differ in their learning speed. 

There has been some research pioneered by W. C. Sheldon at Harvard in the 1930 s and 40 s on the correlation between body type and learning characteristics. Smith 1949 pp. 310 320 . Sheldon delineated three body types based on the embryonic source of tissue ectomorph tall and skinny mesomorph compact and muscular and endomorph large and or overweight .

More recently Chopra has pointed out that a particular traditional medical system of interest to him also defines three basic physiological types in a manner similar to Sheldon s. Chopra 1990 pp. 33 41 .

According to Chopra some students endomorphs learn slowly but retain knowledge quite well and others who learn quickly tend to forget just as quickly ectomorphs .

Therefore physical examination of students may provide data indicative of learning characteristics. Further the invention can be used to validate or derive correlations between measured physiological parameters and learning behavior. When correlations are found the identification of learning characteristics can be made based on the physiological parameters which are presumably easier to ascertain.

For example a standard set of physiological parameters of students are measured and placed into the PROFILES. Known medical and public health techniques list these standard parameters. Then over time the INTELLIGENT ADMINISTRATOR looks for correlations between learning speed preferred learning style etc. and the parameters. Known statistical techniques provide the correlation.

When correlations are found then the measured physical parameters are used to indicate the learning characteristics of subsequent students rather than testing for the characteristics themselves.

There is much written in educational psychology about learning styles usually referred to as cognitive styles. Cognitive style or learning style refers to the way in which a student prefers to organize his or her thought processes his or her preferred mode of thinking. There are a few different approaches which could be used but by far the largest body of research shows that learning style preferences usually fall into one of two groups stereotyped as artistic or scientific thinking.

Hunter Breland a research psychologist for the U.S. national Educational Testing Service asserts that the most widely examined cognitive style is the continuum of field dependence independence Breland 1981 p. 38 . The basic difference between field dependent and field independent problem solver is that the former tend to depend on cues from the environment to solve the problem and the latter tend to rely more on internal cues. He quotes a study by Witkin et al. 1977 which indicates that field independent college students tend to major in the sciences while the more field dependent students gravitate toward majors in education p. 38 .

Entwistle 1981 writes about Pask s research categorizing students as holist or serialist. The holist learning style called comprehension learning involves building descriptions of what is known. The serialist style is called operation learning the facet of the learning process concerned with mastering procedural details. p. 93 

When Pask assigned students to either a matched or mismatched learning situation the results were notable the matched students were able to answer most of the questions regarding the lesson while the mismatched students generally scored less than 50 correct. Entwistle s conclusion is that although teachers will never provide as extreme an example of mismatching there is evidence in primary education to support the fact that different teaching methods are effective to different degrees for students with different personality characteristics.

There has been other research indicating that students differ in their preference of inductive or deductive reasoning. Another area of research has been whether students prefer to use what are commonly considered right brain skills creativity association imagery analogies spatial relationships feelings or left brain skills logic sequence organization structure procedure .

All of these approaches have the same theme the basic question is whether a student prefers to use logical procedural linear thought processes or holistic creative associative spatial processes. Most authors point out that many learners are flexible and can move relatively easily between the two cognitive styles. And as most every author points out everyone must use both approaches at different stages in the solution of a problem and the ideal is to be able to function well in both e.g. an architect must think creatively to plan a house but then he must also know clearly the sequence of building or the house will not materialize .

This computer program can assess whether one of these learning styles is preferred on the basis of choices made in the context of the entry adventure. If a student is reasonably comfortable with both then he or she will be branched into the standard curriculum which is a mix of both styles. If however a student displays a dear preference for one style he she will be branched into a curriculum which favors explanations and examples in that style.

The curriculum must also be structured from sound learning principles. There are a few different schemes for classifying the necessary conditions for learning but Gagne s learning outcomes and conditions of learning are the most thoroughly developed and therefore the most useful in developing computer based instruction.

Gagne classified all possible learning outcomes into five performance categories intellectual skills cognitive strategies verbal information motor skills and attitudes. Examples of these along with their subcategories are shown in Table 3.1 below taken from Gagne s Essentials of Learning for Instruction 1975 p. 68 . These are useful for design purposes in that they describe capabilities which apply across all subject matter areas. According to Gagne certain conditions are necessary for learning each of these types of outcomes. Some conditions are internal and some are external. 

The internal conditions define prerequisite knowledge or skills and external conditions define certain aspects of the instruction the invention should be concerned with both. The following descriptions of internal and external conditions required are derived from Gagne s The Conditions of Learning 1977 pp. 25 49 .

For the learning of intellectual skills the primary internal condition is that the student have prerequisite skills which provide the components of the new skill being learned. External conditions are often in the form of verbal directions which guide the combination of simpler skills into a new integrated whole.

In terms of verbal information internal requirements are that the learner have a good mastery of linguistic rules and vocabulary in order to understand statements presented and he or she must also have previously existing cognitive structures p. 40 or structures of meaningfully organized information which will give meaning and context to the new material presented.

One external condition is stimulation of the appropriate cognitive structure usually in the form of an advance organizer . Another is informing the learner of the objective of the learning this focuses the learner s attention. A third may be repeated hearing or reading of an informational passage most modern theories concur that more information is assimilated with each repetition p. 40 .

Cognitive strategies refer to how the learner organizes his or her own thought processes attention learning remembering thinking . The internal conditions required are memory of intellectual skills and verbal information previously learned which relate to the new task presented. The most effective external condition is evidently frequent opportunities to practice strategizing. According to Gagne practice refines and improves the strategies.

The learning of motor skills e.g. courses in drafting carpentry etc. in the curriculum requires the student to master in overall sequence and pattern of movements. Especially in the case of a complicated procedure e.g. constructing a chair sometimes the sequence must be learned in parts which are then put together. The main external condition required is repeated practice which makes performance more and more smooth and predictable.

Attitudes are expressed behaviorally therefore one internal condition for learning new attitudes is that the learner must have mastered whatever skills or knowledge the behavior requires e.g. knowledge of the rules in order to enjoy playing chess etc. Another internal condition is that the learner must have admiration and respect for people who are seen doing the behavior this is called human modelling p. 46. The only external conditions which seem to be effective are that either the learner himself or a human model experiences the effects of an action as good or bad. 

A summary of the external conditions which facilitate learning is shown in Table 4.2 from Essentials of Learning for Instruction Gagne 1975 p. 93 . One way the invention will ensure mastery will be that the entire curriculum will be designed in accordance with these sound and widely accepted learning conditions of Gagne.

The invention has two ways to help a student who demonstrates through his or her score that internal conditions of learning are deficient e.g. prerequisite skills or knowledge are lacking . The first is that a HELP screen is always available at the student s request. To avoid boredom or frustration a student will be able to access a HELP screen at any point during an instructional unit. This first level HELP screen will allow the student to 

Depending on the option chosen the invention will then adjust a student s learning speed up or down give another explanation and examples one in the same learning style and one in a different learning style review specific sections in the unit or all previous information in the unit or connect the student to a live video teleconference with a teacher. Access to this HELP screen is optional and a student may choose it once several times or not at all during a unit of instruction.

The conference option with SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS makes it possible for a student who has mastered the unit but who is curious about tangential or deeper levels of the material to ask questions while his or her interest is still fresh. If a teacher needs to research the answer the student could find the answer on the system at log on the next day or CLS can page the student with a notice of the answer s availability.

A student who scores below average on the unit would automatically be given a diagnostic check. This is the second way in which the system can assess lack of prerequisite skills as well as other problems. The diagnostic check will be in the form of a question Did you use the HELP screen during the unit and a menu for the student to choose from 

Not straightforward enough linear biased learners will tend to think this about a curriculum that is too holistic 

Explanations seem incomplete holistic biased learners will tend to think this about a curriculum that is too linear .

The computer system will automatically process the diagnostic results and adjust the curriculum accordingly. If the student requests or checks Other he she will be connected with a teacher for a live teleconference. After this diagnostic step the student will then be given a menu screen with the choices 

If the student chooses to either change subjects or log off the computer will automatically place him at the beginning of customized remediation for this unit the next time this subject is requested. If the student chooses further study he will begin the customized remedial content for the unit. This will include new explanations examples and practice situations.

When the remedial unit is complete the score is displayed and the above loop is repeated. If the student s score is still below average he should automatically be connected with a teacher for a conference.

The teachers who work with this system will need to have Teachers Guides containing all the content and resources in the system there will be one of these for each grade level. They will need to know these well so that they can give assignments within the system to cover different problems that may arise.

The invention can be designed to provide many options and the student s preferences can lead him through the curriculum to some extent but the teachers role will be critical in guiding the student through any rough spots and being sure that the entire year s curriculum is completed on time.

Evaluation and revision must be built into the implementation of the system especially for the first two years of use. Both the student and teacher should evaluate each unit of instruction as it is completed. The student could have a very short on screen questionnaire immediately after the unit score is displayed and the teacher could have the option of recording any comments about the content or design of the unit in the light of that student s experience.

Johnny age 10 logs on to the system for the first time. The screen asks him to type his name age and assesses Johnny s last grade completed in school which in this case was fourth grade.

The computer automatically branches Johnny into the fifth grade entry adventure for boys the world of ancient Welsh legends brought to life again through a time warp caused by the bizarre collision of incompatible electromagnetic fields on the exact spot where the Lord of Death was vanquished centuries ago. Death and his forces are abroad again causing terrible damage. The challenge is to find him and trap him into returning to this spot where the quantum mechanical laws of nature are normally strong enough to hold him fast.

To help Johnny solve this challenge two guides provide assistance one explains things using analogies and associations and the other uses logical linear no frills explanations. Johnny is frequently asked which of these guides he wants to ask for advice in this way the system can determine whether Johnny has a preferred learning style.

Johnny is given information of varying complexity at different points in the adventure. He is then asked to apply it in a number of situations. The computer tracks how many choices it takes Johnny to solve the problem and compares this number to the norm. Assume that Johnny falls into the lower range.

Having finished the entry adventure CLS identifies Unit 1 of the science curriculum. He first sees a short video clip of the science teacher who introduces himself explains how the unit is structured and reminds Johnny that the HELP screen is available at any time and that Johnny call talk with him in person by choosing that option. Then Johnny begins Unit 1.

The testing indicated that Johnny is a slower learner who is more comfortable with a holistic learning style so he is branched into the holistic dominant curriculum at the slower learning speed. First he sees and hears the story which acts as the advance organizer for the year s science study there is a benevolent extraterrestrial messenger who has been given one year to convince his superiors that the earth should be spared from destruction.

Johnny s lessons examine selected features of the earth. At the end of each lesson Johnny must provide information to the messenger which indicates whether the features studied have value and should be preserved so that the messenger can relay the information. The learning objectives for the year will be listed in this context. Then Johnny will see the tasks learning objectives that he must master for Unit on Geology.

The learning outcomes expected in Unit also verbal information intellectual skills all levels and cognitive strategies. Gagne s critical learning conditions e.g. presenting important ideas in context or building in occasional reviews of what has been learned from Table 4.2 provide the structure for the stories games and adventures which comprise the unit of instruction.

Johnny works along in this highly but transparently structured learning environment until he doesn t understand something. At that point he remembers that he can use the HELP screen. He chooses the HELP screen and indicates that he wants a further explanation. He is given two more explanations one in each learning style with examples and two practice questions at the end. His answer indicate that he understands and he is branched back into the unit.

Later in the unit he isn t sure that he understands something and he chooses practice questions under HELP . Still confused after those he asks for further explanation which still doesn t clear up the problem. He is automatically branched into a live teleconference with the teacher who sets him back on track and tells Johnny how he can get more information on the subject if he wants but tells him that now he can also go on if he prefers.

Johnny continues work in the unit until he has another question he calls up the HELP screen and selects further explanation. This time he understands well enough after the explanations to answer the two practice questions correctly and he is then branched back into the unit.

Johnny finishes the unit with a test of his mastery of the learning objectives for the unit. Rather than calling it a test the system presents it as his report for the extraterrestrial it includes geological reasons why the earth and the study of its geology is important.

Johnny finishes the unit with an average score. He is asked to answer three short questions What did you like best about this unit What did you like least . . . Any ideas for making it better regarding the appeal and effectiveness of the unit. Then he is given the options of going on to the next unit changing subjects talking with the teacher or logging off.

In a traditional case where goods are introduced to a customer in a traditional way that is through a catalog sent via traditional mail not electronic mail and so forth or through other media without using an online communication system If the customer has a question about the introduced goods the customer may directly call a company or the like which handles the goods and inquire thereof about the goods. In such a case the customer tells the company the trade names article identification numbers and so forth of the goods. Then the customer may obtain an answer as to how to use the goods a payment method when buying the goods and so forth from a person in the customer service division in the company.

However in an online mail order case goods information is transmitted to a customer from the center the sales company via the online communication system. In response thereto the customer may make an order for an article and transmit this information to the center via the online communication system. Therefore in such a case it is not possible to perform direct conversation between the customer and the center the sales company . A database has been considered for explaining goods and answering possible customer s questions. However the contents of the customer s questions may vary for each particular customer. Therefore the database which can answer various possible questions of the customer needs to have a very large amount of data and thus may be inefficient. Further when assuming all possible customer s questions about the goods and preparing answers thereto it is not possible that customers actually ask all the assumed possible questions. Therefore a database may not be an efficient way to prepare all the answers for all the assumed possible customer s questions.

The present invention has been developed in consideration of the above described problems. The present invention provides an answering method and system in online shopping which enables in an online communication system easy production of data for answering customer s questions and preparation of answers to general questions. Further the answering method and system in online shopping enables in a case where complete answers could not be prepared for all the possible questions an answer to be transmitted to the customer when the answer has been prepared for a particular question given by the customer via electronic mail.

According to a first aspect of the present invention in online shopping in which a mail order business is conducted between a center and a terminal via an online communication system for answering a question of a customer necessary but minimum answers to questions are prepared in a database the database is searched when the customer asks a question A and when an answer A to the question A is present in the database transmits the answer A to the customer via the online communication system an answer B is prepared when an answer to the question A is not present in the database and the answer B is stored in the database and the answer B is transmitted to the customer via electronic mail.

According to a second aspect of the present invention the question A is stored as inquiring screen image information to be transmitted to customers when an answer to the question A is not present in the database.

According to a third aspect of the present invention the customer is able to input any other question when the customer wishes to ask a question other than predetermined questions previously stored in an inquiring screen image information any other question asked by the customer is temporarily stored when receiving any other question any other question and an answer thereto are stored as a question and answer set when the answer thereto is prepared and at an any point of time the database and the inquiring screen image information are updated using the question and answer set.

According to a fourth aspect of the present invention in online shopping in which a mail order business is performed between a center and a terminal via an online communication system for answering a question asked by a customer there is provided an answer database for previously storing necessary but minimum answers to questions question item determination means for receiving a question A from the customer and determining whether or not the question A is included in predetermined question items search means for searching the answer database when the question item determination means has determined that the question A is included in the predetermined question items online transmission means for transmitting to the terminal via an online communication system an answer A obtained by the search means answer requesting means for requesting an answer when the question item determination means has determined that the question A is not included in the predetermined questions updating means for updating the answer database using an answer B after the answer B is obtained through the answer requesting means and electronic mail transmission means for transmitting the answer B to the terminal via electronic mail after the answer B is obtained through the answer requesting means.

According to a fifth aspect of the present invention the updating means includes goods master file updating means for adding a question type code representing the question A to at least one predetermined question type of a goods master file when the question A has received the answer B. The goods master file stores the at least one predetermined question type corresponding to a question item relevant to an article code of an article that the customer selected.

According to a sixth aspect of the present invention the updating means comprises inquiring screen image information updating means for adding the question A to the inquiring screen image information to be displayed to the customer when the question A has not been included in the inquiring screen image information yet.

According to a seventh aspect of the present invention the electronic mail transmission means transmits the answer B only to the terminal that asked the question A.

In the first and fourth aspects of the present invention answers to all possible questions are not prepared in the database. Only necessary but minimum answers for goods which can be obtained in regular patterns are prepared in the database. Then when the customer gives a new question an answer to which is not included in the database an answer is transmitted to the customer via electronic mail and also the answer is additionally stored in the database. Thus answers are automatically accumulated in the database. The thus accumulated answers can also be provided for other customers when receiving questions from other customers. Further because answers to all possible questions are not prepared it is possible to reduce manpower costs and also to reduce otherwise necessary data storage capacity.

In the second and sixth aspects of the present invention similar to the accumulation of answers in the database all expected question items are included in the inquiring screen image information to be displayed to the customer. New question items that customers input are automatically additionally included in the inquiring screen image information. Thus question items are automatically accumulated in the inquiring screen image information. Similar to the above described first and fourth aspects it is possible to reduce manpower costs and also to reduce otherwise necessary data storage capacity.

In the third aspect of the present invention when the customer inputs a question item which has not been stored yet the input question is stored in a predetermined file. Then after an answer to that question is obtained the answer is stored together with the question as a set. Thereby it is possible to update the database and inquiring screen image information at any point of time using the stored answer and question set. Therefore it is possible to perform the updating operation when periodically updating general information. It is also possible to perform the updating operation immediately after the answer is obtained. Thus the updating operation is free from any time condition.

In the fifth aspect of the present invention each inquiring screen image information is provided for a respective article code stored in the goods master file. Further a type code is given in the goods master file for each question item. When a question is asked by the customer and a type code of the given question item has not been stored in the goods master file a new type code is additionally stored in the goods master file similar to updating of the database and inquiring screen image information. Thereby it is possible to keep consistency between the data stored in the goods master file database and inquiring screen image information. Thereby it is possible to prevent the amount of data transfer between the center and terminals from unnecessarily increasing.

In the seventh aspect of the present invention when a customer asks a new question an answer that is prepared for the question afterward is then transmitted only to that customer. That is it is not necessary to transmit the answer to other customers because the other customer do not need that answer. Thereby it is possible to prevent the amount of data transfer between the center and terminals from unnecessarily increasing.

Thus according to the present invention when an answer does not exist in the database the answer is obtained from sales staff the obtained answer is sent only to a customer who requested the answer and a database and so forth are appropriately updated using the obtained answer. Thereby after the updating other customers can obtain the same answer by an easy regular question item selection operation.

The web customer service component of the present invention provides for creating and managing service cases and following up on those service cases. The problems set forth in the service cases are analyzed and are routed to the appropriate resources. Optionally the service case component may integrate with issue tracking tools such as Vantive to identify problem areas. Also a user may be allowed to track the status of a submitted service case.

Online support is provided by the web customer service component of the present invention and is designed to handle multiple users simultaneously. A knowledge base would store support information. Conversation based telephone inquiries are handled for automated support. For example a user may verbally ask a question and voice recognition software would choose an appropriate automated response based on recognized words in the question of the user. Further calls may be automatically routed to the appropriate resource based on user input. Call through capabilities from a web link may be offered.

A user may also enter online questions. Email would be a popular means of entering online questions. Real time public and private chat sessions could also take place. Live agents could be kept on hand to answer any questions that the automated responses did not adequately respond to. Also follow up questions web pages links files graphics animations and the like could also be sent to users.

The web customer service component of the present invention lists warranties for view by a user in operation of . When a user has a product that requires service or return under the warranty the identity of the user is checked to ensure that the user has registered. The claim made by the user is then checked and compared to the warranty to ensure that the claim meet warranty criteria for the requested service or replacement. Once validated the claim is routed to the appropriate agent.

The web customer service component of the present invention may also provide a method and apparatus for handling complaints that allows complainants to lodge anonymous complaints against subjects informs the subjects of the complaints permits the subjects to respond to the complaints encourages settlements of the complaints and holds the parties to the complaints accountable for their conduct while attempting to resolve the complaints.

The method of the present invention is preferably implemented with a programmed central computer a plurality of access terminals and a communications network coupling the central computer with the access terminals. The central computer is programmed to receive complaints and responses store the complaints and responses in individual data records and negotiate settlements to the complaints by several means described in the Detailed Description below. Once the disputes are resolved the settlements or judgments are stored along with their respective complaints and responses in the data records.

The central computer is also programmed to provide public access to the data records to permit viewing of the corresponding complaints responses and settlements for allowing other users to gauge the conduct of the subjects and to encourage the subjects to respond to the complaints in a timely and satisfactory manner. Moreover the central computer is programmed to monitor and rate the conduct and performance of both the complainants and the subjects during the course of the disputes. The ratings can be used to affect the outcome of the disputes and for other purposes to hold the parties accountable for their conduct during the attempted resolution of the disputes to encourage good conduct and cooperation between the parties during the course of the disputes.

 a proprietary or confidentiality interests in electronic information. It can for example help ensure that information is used only in authorized ways 

 b financial interests resulting from the use of electronically distributed information. It can help ensure that content providers will be paid for use of distributed information and

 c interests in electronic credit and electronic currency storage communication and or use including electronic cash banking and purchasing.

Protecting the rights of electronic community members involves a broad range of technologies. WAF combines these technologies in a way that creates a distributed electronic rights protection environment. This environment secures and protects transactions and other processes important for rights protection. WAF for example provides the ability to prevent or impede interference with and or observation of important rights related transactions and processes. WAF in its preferred embodiment uses special purpose tamper resistant Secure Processing Units SPUs to help provide a high level of security for WAF processes and information storage and communication.

The rights protection problems solved by the present invention are electronic versions of basic societal issues. These issues include protecting property rights protecting privacy rights properly compensating people and organizations for their work and risk protecting money and credit and generally protecting the security of information. WAF employs a system that uses a common set of processes to manage rights issues in an efficient trusted and cost effective way.

WAF can be used to protect the rights of parties who create electronic content such as for example records games movies newspapers electronic books and reference materials personal electronic mail and confidential records and communications. The invention can also be used to protect the rights of parties who provide electronic products such as publishers and distributors the rights of parties who provide electronic credit and currency to pay for use of products for example credit clearinghouses and banks the rights to privacy of parties who use electronic content such as consumers business people governments and the privacy rights of parties described by electronic information such as privacy rights related to information contained in a medical record tax record or personnel record.

 a commercial interests in electronically distributed information the present invention can help ensure for example that parties will be paid for use of distributed information in a manner consistent with their agreement 

 b proprietary and or confidentiality interests in electronic information the present invention can for example help ensure that data is used only in authorized ways 

 c interests in electronic credit and electronic currency storage communication and or use this can include electronic cash banking and purchasing and

 d interests in electronic information derived at least in part from use of other electronic information.

WAF is a cost effective and efficient rights protection solution that provides a unified consistent system for securing and managing transaction processing. WAF can 

WAF economically and efficiently fulfills the rights protection needs of electronic community members. Users of WAF will not require additional rights protection systems for different information highway products and rights problems nor will they be required to install and learn a new system for each new information highway application.

WAF provides a unified solution that allows all content creators providers and users to employ the same electronic rights protection solution. Under authorized circumstances the participants can freely exchange content and associated content control sets. This means that a user of WAF may if allowed use the same electronic system to work with different kinds of content having different sets of content control information. The content and control information supplied by one group can be used by people who normally use content and control information supplied by a different group. WAF can allow content to be exchanged universally and users of an implementation of the present invention can interact electronically without fear of incompatibilities in content control violation of rights or the need to get install or learn a new content control system.

The WAF securely administers transactions that specify protection of rights. It can protect electronic rights including for example 

WAF can enable a very broad variety of electronically enforced commercial and societal agreements. These agreements can include electronically implemented contracts licenses laws regulations and tax collection.

Traditional content control mechanisms often require users to purchase more electronic information than the user needs or desires. For example infrequent users of shrink wrapped software are required to purchase a program at the same price as frequent users even though they may receive much less value from their less frequent use. Traditional systems do not scale cost according to the extent or character of usage and traditional systems can not attract potential customers who find that a fixed price is too high. Systems using traditional mechanisms are also not normally particularly secure. For example shrink wrapping does not prevent the constant illegal pirating of software once removed from either its physical or electronic package.

Traditional electronic information rights protection systems are often inflexible and inefficient and may cause a content provider to choose costly distribution channels that increase a product s price. In general these mechanisms restrict product pricing configuration and marketing flexibility. These compromises are the result of techniques for controlling information which cannot accommodate both different content models and content models which reflect the many varied requirements such as content delivery strategies of the model participants. This can limit a provider s ability to deliver sufficient overall value to justify a given product s cost in the eyes of many potential users. WAF allows content providers and distributors to create applications and distribution networks that reflect content providers and users preferred business models. It offers users a uniquely cost effective and feature rich system that supports the ways providers want to distribute information and the ways users want to use such information. WAF supports content control models that ensure rights and allow content delivery strategies to be shaped for maximum commercial results.

WAF can protect a collection of rights belonging to various parties having in rights in or to electronic information. This information may be at one location or dispersed across and or moving between multiple locations. The information may pass through a chain of distributors and a chain of users. Usage information may also be reported through one or more chains of parties. In general WAF enables parties that a have rights in electronic information and or b act as direct or indirect agents for parties who have rights in electronic information to ensure that the moving accessing modifying or otherwise using of information can be securely controlled by rules regarding how when where and by whom such activities can be performed.

WAF is a secure system for regulating electronic conduct and commerce. Regulation is ensured by control information put in place by one or more parties. These parties may include content providers electronic hardware manufacturers financial service providers or electronic infrastructure companies such as cable or telecommunications companies. The control information implements Rights Applications. Rights applications run on the base software of the preferred embodiment. This base software serves as a secure flexible general purpose foundation that can accommodate many different rights applications that is many different business models and their respective participant requirements.

A rights application under WAF is made up of special purpose pieces each of which can correspond to one or more basic electronic processes needed for a rights protection environment. These processes can be combined together like building blocks to create electronic agreements that can protect the rights and may enforce fulfillment of the obligations of electronic information users and providers. One or more providers of electronic information can easily combine selected building blocks to create a rights application that is unique to a specific content distribution model. A group of these pieces can represent the capabilities needed to fulfill the agreement s between users and providers. These pieces accommodate many requirements of electronic commerce including 

For electronic commerce a rights application under the preferred embodiment of the present invention can provide electronic enforcement of the business agreements between all participants. Since different groups of components can be put together for different applications the present invention can provide electronic control information for a wide variety of different products and markets. This means the present invention can provide a unified efficient secure and cost effective system for electronic commerce and data security. This allows WAF to serve as a single standard for electronic rights protection data security and electronic currency and banking.

In a WAF the separation between a rights application and its foundation permits the efficient selection of sets of control information that are appropriate for each of many different types of applications and uses. These control sets can reflect both rights of electronic community members as well as obligations such as providing a history of one s use of a product or paying taxes on one s electronic purchases WAF flexibility allows its users to electronically implement and enforce common social and commercial ethics and practices. By providing a unified control system the present invention supports a vast range of possible transaction related interests and concerns of individuals communities businesses and governments. Due to its open design WAF allows normally under securely controlled circumstances applications using technology independently created by users to be added to the system and used in conjunction with the foundation of the invention. In sum WAF provides a system that can fairly reflect and enforce agreements among parties. It is a broad ranging and systematic solution that answers the pressing need for a secure cost effective and fair electronic environment.

WAF prevents many forms of unauthorized use of electronic information by controlling and auditing and other administration of use electronically stored and or disseminated information. This includes for example commercially distributed content electronic currency electronic credit business transactions such as EDI confidential communications and the like. WAF can further be used to enable commercially provided electronic content to be made available to users in user defined portions rather than constraining the user to use portions of content that were predetermined by a content creator and or other provider for billing purposes.

WAF extensively employs methods in the form of software objects to augment configurability portability and security of the WAF environment. It also employs a software object architecture for WAF content containers that carries protected content and may also carry both freely available information e.g summary table of contents and secured content control information which ensures the performance of control information. Content control information governs content usage according to criteria set by holders of rights to an object s contents and or according to parties who otherwise have rights associated with distributing such content such as governments financial credit providers and users .

In part security is enhanced by object methods employed by the present invention because the encryption schemes used to protect an object can efficiently be further used to protect the associated content control information software control information and relevant data from modification. Said object techniques also enhance portability between various computer and or other appliance environments because electronic information in the form of content can be inserted along with for example in the same object container as content control information for said content to produce a published object. As a result various portions of said control information may be specifically adapted for different environments such as for diverse computer platforms and operating systems and said various portions may all be carried by a WAF container.

An objective of WAF is supporting a transaction distribution control standard. Development of such a standard has many obstacles given the security requirements and related hardware and communications issues widely differing environments information types types of information usage business and or data security goals varieties of participants and properties of delivered information. A significant feature of WAF accommodates the many varying distribution and other transaction variables by in part decomposing electronic commerce and data security functions into generalized capability modules executable within a secure hardware SPU and or corresponding software subsystem and further allowing extensive flexibility in assembling modifying and or replacing such modules e.g. load modules and or methods in applications run on a WAF installation foundation. This configurability and reconfigurability allows electronic commerce and data security participants to reflect their priorities and requirements through a process of iteratively shaping an evolving extended electronic agreement electronic control model . This shaping can occur as content control information passes from one WAF participant to another and to the extent allowed by in place content control information. This process allows users of WAF to recast existing control information and or add new control information as necessary including the elimination of no longer required elements .

WAF supports trusted sufficiently secure electronic information distribution and usage control models for both commercial electronic content distribution and data security applications. It can be configured to meet the diverse requirements of a network of interrelated participants that may include content creators content distributors client administrators end users and or clearinghouses and or other content usage information users. These parties may constitute a network of participants involved in simple to complex electronic content dissemination usage control usage reporting and or usage payment. Disseminated content may include both originally provided and WAF generated information such as content usage information and content control information may persist through both chains one or more pathways of content and content control information handling as well as the direct usage of content. The configurability provided by the present invention is particularly critical for supporting electronic commerce that is enabling businesses to create relationships and evolve strategies that offer competitive value. Electronic commerce tools that are not inherently configurable and interoperable will ultimately fail to produce products and services that meet both basic requirements and evolving needs of most commerce applications.

Together these WAF components comprise a secure virtual distributed content and or appliance control auditing and other administration reporting and payment environment. In some embodiments and where commercially acceptable certain WAF participants such as clearinghouses that normally maintain sufficiently physically secure non WAF processing environments may be allowed to employ HPEs rather WAF hardware elements and interoperate for example with WAF end users and content providers. WAF components together comprise a configurable consistent secure and trusted architecture for distributed asynchronous control of electronic content and or appliance usage. WAF supports a universe wide environment for electronic content delivery broad dissemination usage reporting and usage related payment activities.

WAF provides generalized configurability. This results in part from decomposition of generalized requirements for supporting electronic commerce and data security into a broad range of constituent atomic and higher level components such as load modules data elements and methods that may be variously aggregated together to form control methods for electronic commerce applications commercial electronic agreements and data security arrangements. WAF provides a secure operating environment employing WAF foundation elements along with secure independently deliverable WAF components that enable electronic commerce models and relationships to develop. WAF specifically supports the unfolding of distribution models in which content providers over time can expressly agree to or allow subsequent content providers and or users to participate in shaping the control information for and consequences of use of electronic content and or appliances. A very broad range of the functional attributes important for supporting simple to very complex electronic commerce and data security activities are supported by capabilities of the present invention. As a result WAF supports most types of electronic information and or appliance usage control including distribution security usage auditing reporting other administration and payment arrangements.

WAF in its preferred embodiment employs object software technology and uses object technology to form containers for delivery of information that is at least in part encrypted or otherwise secured. These containers may contain electronic content products or other electronic information and some or all of their associated permissions control information. These container objects may be distributed along pathways involving content providers and or content users. They may be securely moved among nodes of a Virtual Distribution Environment WAF arrangement which nodes operate WAF foundation software and execute control methods to enact electronic information usage control and or administration models. The containers delivered through use of the preferred embodiment of the present invention may be employed both for distributing WAF control instructions information and or to encapsulate and electronically distribute content that has been at least partially secured.

Content providers who employ the present invention may include for example software application and game publishers database publishers cable television and radio broadcasters electronic shopping vendors and distributors of information in electronic document book periodical e mail and or other forms. Corporations government agencies and or individual end users who act as storers of and or distributors of electronic information may also be WAF content providers in a restricted model a user provides content only to himself and employs WAF to secure his own confidential information against unauthorized use by other parties . Electronic information may include proprietary and or confidential information for personal or internal organization use as well as information such as software applications documents entertainment materials and or reference information which may be provided to other parties. Distribution may be by for example physical media delivery broadcast and or telecommunication means and in the form of static files and or streams of data. WAF may also be used for example for multi site real time interaction such as teleconferencing interactive games or on line bulletin boards where restrictions on and or auditing of the use of all or portions of communicated information is enforced.

WAF provides important mechanisms for both enforcing commercial agreements and enabling the protection of privacy rights. WAF can securely deliver information from one party to another concerning the use of commercially distributed electronic content. Even if parties are separated by several steps in a chain pathway of handling for such content usage information such information is protected by WAF through encryption and or other secure processing. Because of that protection the accuracy of such information is guaranteed by WAF and the information can be trusted by all parties to whom it is delivered. Furthermore WAF guarantees that all parties can trust that such information cannot be received by anyone other than the intended authorized party ies because it is encrypted such that only an authorized party or her agents can decrypt it. Such information may also be derived through a secure WAF process at a previous pathway of handling location to produce secure WAF reporting information that is then communicated securely to its intended recipient s WAF secure subsystem. Because WAF can deliver such information securely parties to an electronic agreement need not trust the accuracy of commercial usage and or other information delivered through means other than those under control of WAF.

While various embodiments have been described above it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only and not limitation. Thus the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents.

WAF provides organization community and or universe wide secure environments whose integrity is assured by processes securely controlled in WAF participant user installations nodes . WAF installations in the preferred embodiment may include both software and tamper resistant hardware semiconductor elements. Such a semiconductor arrangement comprises at least in part special purpose circuitry that has been designed to protect against tampering with or unauthorized observation of the information and functions used in performing the WAF s control functions. The special purpose secure circuitry provided by the present invention includes at least one of a dedicated semiconductor arrangement known as a Secure Processing Unit SPU and or a standard microprocessor microcontroller and or other processing logic that accommodates the requirements of the present invention and functions as an SPU. WAF s secure hardware may be found incorporated into for example a fax modem chip or chip pack I O controller video display controller and or other available digital processing arrangements. It is anticipated that portions of the present invention s WAF secure hardware capabilities may ultimately be standard design elements of central processing units CPUs for computers and various other electronic devices.

Designing WAF capabilities into one or more standard microprocessor microcontroller and or other digital processing components may materially reduce WAF related hardware costs by employing the same hardware resources for both the transaction management uses contemplated by the present invention and for other host electronic appliance functions. This means that a WAF SPU can employ share circuitry elements of a standard CPU. For example if a standard processor can operate in protected mode and can execute WAF related instructions as a protected activity then such an embodiment may provide sufficient hardware security for a variety of applications and the expense of a special purpose processor might be avoided. Under one preferred embodiment of the present invention certain memory e.g. RAM ROM NVRAM is maintained during WAF related instruction processing in a protected mode for example as supported by protected mode microprocessors . This memory is located in the same package as the processing logic e.g. processor . Desirably the packaging and memory of such a processor would be designed using security techniques that enhance its resistance to tampering.

The degree of overall security of the WAF system is primarily dependent on the degree of tamper resistance and concealment of WAF control process execution and related data storage activities. Employing special purpose semiconductor packaging techniques can significantly contribute to the degree of security. Concealment and tamper resistance in semiconductor memory e.g. RAM ROM NVRAM can be achieved in part by employing such memory within an SPU package by encrypting data before it is sent to external memory such as an external RAM package and decrypting encrypted data within the CPU RAM package before it is executed. This process is used for important WAF related data when such data is stored on unprotected media for example standard host storage such as random access memory mass storage etc. In that event a WAF SPU would encrypt data that results from a secure WAF execution before such data was stored in external memory.

WAF employs a variety of capabilities that serve as a foundation for a general purpose sufficiently secure distributed electronic commerce solution. WAF enables an electronic commerce marketplace that supports divergent competitive business partnerships agreements and evolving overall business models. For example WAF includes features that 

Use of bitmap meters including regular and wide bitmap meters to record usage and or purchase of information in conjunction with other elements of the preferred embodiment of the present invention uniquely supports efficient maintenance of usage history for a rental b flat fee licensing or purchase c licensing or purchase discounts based upon historical usage variables and d reporting to users in a manner enabling users to determine whether a certain item was acquired or acquired within a certain time period without requiring the use of conventional database mechanisms which are highly inefficient for these applications . Bitmap meter methods record activities associated with electronic appliances properties objects or portions thereof and or administrative activities that are independent of specific properties objects etc. performed by a user and or electronic appliance such that a content and or appliance provider and or controller of an administrative activity can determine whether a certain activity has occurred at some point or during a certain period in the past for example certain use of a commercial electronic content product and or appliance . Such determinations can then be used as part of pricing and or control strategies of a content and or appliance provider and or controller of an administrative activity. For example the content provider may choose to charge only once for access to a portion of a property regardless of the number of times that portion of the property is accessed by a user.

Generally the extraction features of the present invention allow users to aggregate and or disseminate and or otherwise use protected electronic content information extracted from content container sources while maintaining secure WAF capabilities thus preserving the rights of providers in said content information after various content usage processes.

An important part of WAF provided by the present invention is the core secure transaction control arrangement herein called an SPU or SPUs that typically must be present in each user s computer other electronic appliance or network. SPUs provide a trusted environment for generating decryption keys encrypting and decrypting information managing the secure communication of keys and other information between electronic appliances i.e. between WAF installations and or between plural WAF instances within a single WAF installation securely accumulating and managing audit trail reporting and budget information in secure and or non secure non volatile memory maintaining a secure database of control information management instructions and providing a secure environment for performing certain other control and administrative functions.

A hardware SPU rather than a software emulation within a WAF node is necessary if a highly trusted environment for performing certain WAF activities is required. Such a trusted environment may be created through the use of certain control software one or more tamper resistant hardware modules such as a semiconductor or semiconductor chipset including for example a tamper resistant hardware electronic appliance peripheral device for use within and or operatively connected to an electronic appliance. With the present invention the trustedness of a hardware SPU can be enhanced by enclosing some or all of its hardware elements within tamper resistant packaging and or by employing other tamper resisting techniques e.g. microfusing and or thin wire detection techniques . A trusted environment of the present invention implemented in part through the use of tamper resistant semiconductor design contains control logic such as a microprocessor that securely executes WAF processes.

A WAF node s hardware SPU is a core component of a WAF secure subsystem and may employ some or all of an electronic appliance s primary control logic such as a microcontroller microcomputer or other CPU arrangement. This primary control logic may be otherwise employed for non WAF purposes such as the control of some or all of an electronic appliance s non WAF functions. When operating in a hardware SPU mode said primary control logic must be sufficiently secure so as to protect and conceal important WAF processes. For example a hardware SPU may employ a host electronic appliance microcomputer operating in protected mode while performing WAF related activities thus allowing portions of WAF processes to execute with a certain degree of security. This alternate embodiment is in contrast to the preferred embodiment wherein a trusted environment is created using a combination of one or more tamper resistant semiconductors that are not part of said primary control logic. In either embodiment certain control information software and parameter data must be securely maintained within the SPU and further control information can be stored externally and securely e.g. in encrypted and tagged form and loaded into said hardware SPU when needed. In many cases and in particular with microcomputers the preferred embodiment approach of employing special purpose secure hardware for executing said WAF processes rather than using said primary control logic may be more secure and efficient. The level of security and tamper resistance required for trusted SPU hardware processes depends on the commercial requirements of particular markets or market niches and may vary widely.

The Delivery Vehicle Framework presents a way to organize technology architecture information. When presenting this type of content to clients one will need to tailor the information one presents based on the client s background and the terminology they are familiar with. Some of the features of the Delivery Framework include 

During a high level architecture design one can identify architecture services to be addressed by providing a logical level discussion to assess types of base services and products needed for a specific situation.

When Delivery Vehicles are implemented they reduce time to implement business solutions by providing Starter Kits architectures.

This section should assist an architect in understanding the characteristics of and the implications from selecting a specific technology generation. The strengths and weaknesses of each technology generation should be understood when planning and designing a system. When identifying the core technologies to be used in an architecture a view of the client s existing IT architecture guiding principles and business imperatives should be taken into consideration as depicted in .

It is important to realize that a distinct static division does not exist between the different technology generations. It is possible that an architecture will consist of components from more than one generation.

The goal should be to understand the pros and cons of the different technology options available for each component and to select the most appropriate one based on the client s requirements.

It is becoming more important to leverage existing systems and integrate them with new applications. A typical scenario can involve mainframe legacy systems acting as servers in a client server architecture application servers being accessed from both traditional GUI clients built in Powerbuilder and Visual Basic and from Web based front ends accessing the application servers via a Web server.

From a technology point of view a new custom made application should generally use the most recent Architecture Generation to assure that the application will live longer by better being able to adapt to future changes.

This implies that all new applications should ideally be based on a Netcentric Architecture rather than on a traditional client server or a host based architecture.

However choosing a generation is not just a technical decision. Often key technology architecture decisions are made as a result of factors which are completely non technical in nature such as financial factors internal and client politics and implementation operational considerations.

When deciding whether to employ a Netcentric solution i.e. incorporating Web based user interfaces and Internet application styles one must keep in mind that these technologies are not a panacea and should be used only when there is solid business reason. They require new investments in skills tools development and operations processes. Due to the relative immaturity of tools and products they also represent additional risks both in technical terms such as performance and reliability and in strategic terms such as vendor and product quality and stability.

Regardless today each project should always consider the prospect of utilizing Netcentric technologies. It is important to evaluate whether the application can benefit from a Netcentric style implementation immediately or in the future.

Even if a traditional client server approach e.g. using Visual Basic or PowerBuilder is decided upon the use of Netcentric concepts to produce significant reductions in software packaging and distribution costs should be considered. Such concepts include three or multi tier architectures with more business logic residing on server flexible security architecture and user interface concepts that can be ported to a Web Browser at a later stage.

A Netcentric architecture will usually still support development of client server applications. The opposite is not often true since traditional client server systems usually keep a substantial portion of the business logic on a fat client while Netcentric architectures still favor keeping most business logic at the server side. Also Netcentric architectures tend to be more loosely coupled than the still dominant two tier client server systems.

The following sections identify the main characteristics associated with a Netcentric Client Server or Host based technology generation. This list should in no way be considered complete and exhaustive but is included as a starting point from which the identification process may begin.

If most of the statements in are true one should consider an application based upon the Netcentric technology generation.

The following details the importance of each of the statements in and should assist in identifying the appropriate answer for specific client engagement.

This is especially important if the client plans on developing or operating the application themselves. A significant investment in training and changes to internal organizations may be necessary for successful deployment of this type of system. The client must have a culture that supports change. Some organizations are very conservative and strong making it difficult to deliver a successful project using new technology.

In traditional client server environments distributing an application internally or externally for an enterprise requires that the application be ported recompiled and tested for all specific workstation operating systems. Use of a Universal Client or web browser may eliminate many of these problems by providing a consistent and familiar user interface on many different operating systems and hardware platforms.

The momentum of the Internet is putting a lot of pressure on vendors of various devices to be web enabled. Having the Internet infrastructure in place makes it more feasible for vendors to create new physical devices from which electronic information can be accessed. For example Web televisions are gaining momentum. Now users can access the Internet from a television set. Network Computers thin client devices that download and run applications from a centrally maintained server are generating a lot of interest. Also users want to have access to the same information from multiple physical devices. For example a user might want to have access to his her e mail from a cellular phone from a Web TV or their portable PC.

Expanding the user community of a legacy host or client server system by including an audience which is external to the company can result in dramatic increases in system usage. The additional demand and increased usage placed on existing legacy systems is often difficult to estimate or predict. Analysis must be conducted to ensure existing legacy systems and infrastructure can absorb this increase.

This is probably the main reason for selecting a Netcentric architecture. Through appropriate use of a Netcentric architecture it is often possible to gain exposure to new customers and markets. The client can often achieve significant competitive advantage by providing new services and products to its customers. Also this new channel makes it technically possible to develop a new generation of market of one products where each customer can repeatedly and easily customize a product according to own preferences.

Configuration management of traditional client server applications which tend to be physically distributed across both the client and server is a major issue for many corporations. The software distribution of such applications which are packaged as one large or a combination of a few large executables makes minor updates difficult for even a small scale user population. Every time an update is made a process must be initiated to distribute new code to all client machines. The browser centric application style offers an alternative to this traditional problem of distributing functionality to both internal and external users.

Implementation of a Netcentric architecture can help the client realize a number of business benefits. However the introduction of new technology into an organization does have inherent risks and can result in a significant amount of change. The client should have a culture which can embrace these necessary changes.

Non expert users need a simple to use and familiar interface in order to be able to use the application. As people grow accustomed to Web browsers this will be their preferred user interface. The consistent interface provided by the Web browsers will help reduce the learning curve necessary for becoming familiar with new applications.

G3. Where Appropriate Applications Should be Developed with Multi Media Capabilities for the Presentation of Data Text Sound Video etc. .

The ability to digitize organize and deliver textual graphical and other information e.g. video audio etc. in addition to traditional data to a broader audience enables new methods for people and enterprises to work together. Netcentric technologies e.g. HTML documents plug ins lava etc. and standardization of media information formats enable support for these types of complex documents and applications. Network bandwidth remains a performance issue. However advances in network technologies and compression techniques continue to make richer media enabled documents and applications more feasible on the Web.

G4. The Execution Operation and Development Architectures will be Designed to Support Frequent Releases of Enhancements Modifications to Production Applications.

It is imperative that companies in the current market place be able to quickly modify their business processes in order to address changes in the industry. A Netcentric architecture simplifies frequent software releases for both internal and external users of the systems.

If based upon the client s requirements most of the statements of are true one should consider an application based upon the Client Server technology generation.

The following section details the importance of each of the statements found in and should assist in identifying the appropriate answer for a specific client engagement.

E1. Other Client Server Applications been Developed and Placed in Production and the Client IT Organization Contains Personnel Familiar with Client Server Architecture Concepts.

As with any new technology there is a learning curve related to attaining client server development skills. The development process is often much more efficient when familiar tools and environments are used. The introduction of new technology can also create instability in the operations environment. Client server systems still represent a new technology to many IT departments.

Software distribution is a concern for traditional client server computing environments due to the fact that executable and data files need to reside on the client hard drive. Distribution to a user community outside of the client s organization is even more difficult to implement and manage and will probably be limited to a few key business partners.

State of the art 4GL and 3GL development languages will support advanced user interfaces which require a significant degree of context management between fields and windows. Web based user interfaces do not support such interfaces well yet.

B3. Session Performance is Critical to the Application or Sub Second Response Times are Required for Successful Use.

Client server applications can provide response times necessary to support transaction intensive mission critical systems. Application logic and business data can be distributed between the client and server for optimal efficiency. Web based interfaces still have an inherent overhead due to the connectionless communication and constant downloading of data formatting information and applet code.

Mobile computing is becoming more prevalent in the work place therefore connectivity to a server can not be assumed for all user classes. A client server architecture allows for the distribution of application logic and or data between the server and client. Replication of data and logic is usually necessary for applications that are run on portable computers.

G1. The Client Maintains their Applications Internally and the IT Department has the Necessary Resources Organizations and Processes to Maintain a Client Server Application.

Introduction of a Client Server application to a company s production environment can require a great deal of change to the Execution Operations and Development architectures required to develop run and support the production systems. Before a Client Server application is developed it is important that the client identify how a system of this type will fit within the company s strategic technology plan.

If the clients business and technical requirements meet the following system characteristics consideration should be given to an application based upon the Host technology generation.

The following section details the importance of each of the statements found in and should assist in identifying the appropriate answer for a specific client engagement.

E1. The Client Currently Maintains and Operates Host Based Applications and the IT Organization Contains Personnel Familiar with the Development and Operation of these Types of Applications.

Usually the infrastructure for this type of systems already exists. New development is uncommon typically existing legacy systems need to be extended.

Host systems usually have a mature and stable operations environment. Note that mainframe expertise is currently expensive and in high demand

B1. The Application will Only be Used by a Dedicated Expert User Community Where a GUI is not Needed.

A dedicated work force with low turnaround skilled in the use of character based 3270 applications eliminates the need for a GUI interface.

The high degree of processing power provided by mainframes allows for the development of applications with very high performance requirements.

Mainframes are probably still the most powerful platforms for large scale batch processing. Mature tools exist for scheduling recovery restart sorting merging and moving large sets of data.

Physical connection to the host is required for use of the applications. Methods of mobile computing with distribution of data or business logic is not possible.

The processing power of today s mainframe lends itself well to the development of large scale mission critical applications with a large user base.

G1. The Client has the Resources Organizations and Processes Necessary for the Development and Operation of a Host Based Application.

Before a Host based application is developed it is important that the client identify how a system of this type will fit within the company s strategic technology plan.

Selection of a host based architecture inherently locks the client into dependence upon one vendor for its technology solutions. While IBM is a reputable stable company it is important to ensure that the client s long term business strategy will be supported by IBM s technology vision and direction.

A pure host based architecture eliminates the possibility of distributing data or business logic to the client. This removes some of the application performance benefits which can be seen by a distribution strategy however centralized access to the business logic and business data can improve operational stability and lower costs.

A current trend is to transform mainframe based legacy systems into data and application servers in a multi tiered client server or Netcentric architecture.

DAF provides access to a thought process regarding leadership and architecture frameworks for Execution Development and Operations environments. Very briefly DAF covers 

The Operations Architecture Framework should help with the establishment and operation of a high quality operations environment.

The eCommerce market is rapidly emerging. This is evidenced by the growing numbers of new eCommerce transactional sites the increasing number of exchange of value transactions performed daily the emergence of new entities and businesses focusing on the electronic marketplace the convergence and partnering of existing businesses on the electronic marketplace and the empowerment of the everyday user to satisfy their needs within the evolving electronic marketplace.

One definition of eCommerce is A commercial exchange of value between an enterprise and an external entity either an upstream supplier a partner or a down stream customer over a universal ubiquitous electronic medium. 

The eCommerce Application Framework in DAF is illustrated in . The eCommerce Application Framework eCaf identifies and describes the application capabilities useful or necessary to implementing eCommerce business solutions. It provides a framework to tie business process application and technology aspects of eCommerce together and a basis for mapping and assessing the capabilities of the eCommerce packaged solutions. This framework should be used as a vehicle for communicating and designing eCommerce business solutions.

The eCommerce Application Framework has been created to provide an understanding of the types of services and applications needed to implement an eCommerce solution. illustrates the relationship between the eCommerce Application Framework the possible eCommerce Selling Models enabling technology and enabling eCommerce Software Packages .

The eCaf defines a supporting middle layer between basic Internet or Netcentric enabled products eCommerce Package Software and the technical infrastructure Enabling Technology needed to develop eCommerce enabled web sites based on a business specific selling model eCommerce Selling Models . Note that eCaf just covers the middle layer.

Each solution or site may have a different selling approach architecture utilization of technology or applications. The eCaf includes the concepts applications and services common across the different solutions and has organized them into application capabilities.

Technologically eCommerce business capability requires a logical grouping of services enabling a specific eCommerce functionality. The functionality may be a single technical service within the underlying architecture or an entire application. The capabilities have been derived from surveying multiple eCommerce software packages and eCommerce implementations. As eCommerce evolves the categories and capabilities are apt to change.

In DAF the capabilities are presented as framework components and subcomponents. The eCommerce capabilities illustrate the highest level categories of eCommerce capabilities External Agents Electronic Merchandising Relationship Management Maintenance Administration Order Processing Customer Services Security Decision Support Integration.

The capabilities within a given category may cover the full range of potential selling models. Some components may be specific only to a business to business buyer centric implementation. Additional components may emerge as this technology matures.

It should be borne in mind that the eCaf documentation in DAF focuses on the eCaf capabilities. The enabling technology is discussed elsewhere in DAF see below . The selling models and eCommerce Package Software are discussed only briefly.

The enabling technology for an eCommerce implementation is the same underlying technology used to enable most Netcentric and in some cases client server implementations. In general most implementations will utilize the Netcentric technologies. An understanding of the Netcentric framework will act as a building block for understanding the technology aspects of an eCommerce solution. Information on the Netcentric framework is found in the patent application entitled A SYSTEM METHOD AND ARTICLE OF MANUFACTURE FOR BASE SERVICES PATTERNS IN A NETCENTRIC ENVIRONMENT Ser. No. 09 387 653 filed Aug. 31 1999 and which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

A wide variety of eCommerce solutions fall under the broad umbrella term of eCommerce. The vague definition of eCommerce lends itself to a range of implementations and possibilities. A survey of the sites within the current electronic marketplace reveals the majority of the transactional exchange of value solutions concentrate on selling products. Products can be further divided into physical and electronic.

Across the many exchange of value sites there are three prevalent selling models seller centric buyer centric and auction.

The seller centric model is the most common. In its simplest form a company typically provides information about their products and gives the customer the ability to place orders. More advanced implementations use electronic means for supporting the entire sales and support process including marketing product display merchandising customer needs assessment order processing and many other activities. In most seller centric solutions the infrastructure is created and maintained by the merchant. The customer needs nothing more than a browser and or access to the site.

In a buyer centric solution the main focus is on customer or buyer trying to fulfill a need for a product. In contrast to Seller Centric sites which offer products a buyer centric site displays items the buyer would like to purchase in effect trying to lure sellers. Many of the same capabilities as seller centric sites are needed such as order management and payment capabilities. In this case the customer joins or creates an infrastructure focused on fulfilling his needs. The infrastructure typically provides an environment between the trading partners which promotes browsing and comparing products ordering products fulfillment payment and any needed customer support services. A concentration should be placed on the ease of transactions and information flow.

In most buyer centric cases the buyer or often a consortium of buyers provides the bulk of the eCommerce infrastructure. Additional integration and setup may or may not be required for each of the trading partners who wishes to participate. Implementations requiring sellers to specially configure or integrate their own systems in order to participate are usually only successful where the buyer has substantial market power in the relationship as in GM or Ford buying parts from their suppliers. In such cases agreements must be made as to what information is to be shared how to model the information the standards for messaging and communication and what technologies will be used. Besides the technical hurdle of integrating multiple systems and the somewhat immature state of the software products to date convincing trading partners to adopt an Internet commerce approach can also be very difficult. If one is not a particularly big or powerful buyer it can be difficult to attract potential sellers to come to one s site and spend the time necessary to learn about one s needs. This requires sellers to engage in a very different activity than they have traditionally performed and many are not eager to change their way of doing business for a relatively small customer.

This section of the market has been slower to emerge. As mentioned above trading partner maintenance is a key issue. Companies at the end of the hub must buy into the hub s practices and vision. Future vision and direction are also important. As changes are implemented all trading partners have to move together. Getting buy in from all partners has the potential to slow down the adoption of new technologies and process innovations which over time can lead to a lack luster lowest common denominator approach.

Broker or auction type solutions are also emerging albeit more slowly. Broker implementations don t typically sell their own goods but rather provide an eCommerce environment to facilitate bringing multiple buyers and sellers together. Both buyers and sellers can utilize the broker s site and infrastructure rather than developing and maintaining their own eCommerce capabilities. In this case a broker has set up the infrastructure needed to buy and sell goods. The infrastructure will be very similar to a seller centric solution with the addition of components needed to register goods to be sold or in a buyer centric twist register RFQ s request for quote price negotiation and bidding and reconciliation services.

A Trading Network TN is an excellent business example of a broker site. Users of the TN can issue Request For Quote s RFQ S on the trading network. The request could be for raw materials components or finished items. Suppliers are free to answer an RFQ providing they meet some basic guidelines and requirements. The network provides a true win win relationship. Since the network can be global suppliers the purchaser may never have known about are free to participate.

Another example on the consumer side is a sales website. Such a site offers a variety of computer electronic and fitness goods as well as a general merchandise auction. Customers can browse items in order to view product information and their current bid prices. Interested buyers can place a bid online and see how their bid price compares with others. The auctions are time based and follow a detailed bidding process. As customers are out bid they are notified via email and have the option to reply with a counter bid.

In relation to packaged eCommerce Software the eCaf framework provides a basis for understanding and assessing the capabilities of the ecommerce packages.

If a package is used to implement part of the eCommerce solution an analysis of its underlying technology and business requirements with respect to the Netcentric Framework and the selling models should be conducted. It is important to understand the underlying architecture and any inherent application limitations due to the package s choice of technology used to implement its architecture. In short it is important to understand what comes out of the box. Be sure to understand each of the main components described by the Netcentric Framework e.g. Web Browser Web Server how the components communicate and any limitations of the package and architecture of the component.

A multitude of different packages are emerging usually with the name sounding something similar to eCommerce Server. Each package may boast to be different in the problem it is addressing the architecture or the underlying processes and technology. In addition it may claim to provide an end to end solution for businesses wishing to transact on the Internet. It is currently very difficult to differentiate between the products. The eCAF provides a basis for understanding and assessing the capabilities of existing eCommerce packages as well as those emerging.

A complex eCommerce solution potentially may utilize software from all three of these categories in addition to any custom code needed to integrate them.

The service may include making suggestions based on a user s profile and history. The service requested may also include retrieval of data. Thirdly the service requested may include a product comparison. As an option the data may further include detailed product attributes. As another option the services of other agents may also be used to perform the service.

On the Internet an agent also called an intelligent agent is a program that gathers information or performs some other service without the immediate of a user. See . Typically an agent using parameters provided by the user searches all or some part of the Internet gathers the requested information and presents it back to the requesting user. Intelligent external agent technology will continue to grow as the eCommerce market develops. As the market saturates with products and information the need for techniques or agents to filter this information will grow.

Despite the vast amount of information and tools available on the Internet it is still passive requiring the user to browse through tremendous amounts of information in order to obtain what they need. The introduction of advanced intelligent agent technology will potentially transform the Internet into an active network through which users can delegate tasks to computer programs to complete on their behalf. An agent in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention has the ability to transport itself from one place in the network to another filtering through relevant information in order to perform its task. The software can be designed to make suggestions based on the user s profile and history and change its behavior as it learns from experience and interactions with other agents.

An exemplary agent is a Bargain Finder. The Bargain Finder agent is an intelligent agent used for comparative shopping for music CDs. A user can request the agent to search based on a specific artist and album. The agent would search its known sources gather the needed information and return a comparison list with prices and specifications to the requester. If this concept is applied to the business world the potential value increases dramatically.

A business may utilize a similar concept but on a much grander scale allowing the user to take advantage of the lowest available price. Providing there are ample suppliers a business may create an agent to search for the best prices on construction materials or assembly components. In this case the agent could provide substantial savings in material costs and personnel.

From a site s perspective there are inbound and outbound agents. An outbound agent would be an agent a site sends out to gather information. For example a site selling digital goods may embed a specific digital watermark within its digital goods. It could then create an agent to search the Web for this digital watermark to determine if unauthorized uses exist. Another example would be competitive analysis. A site may create an agent for polling competing sites for current prices and product list in order to price the site s own items competitively.

On the other hand the site may deal with inbound agents. The emergence of the comprehensive intelligent shopping assistant is a prime example of inbound agents. Agents may enter a site in an attempt to gather information about products availability and prices. For example an Internet shopper may use a shopping agent to submit a request for a particular product. The shopping agent determines which sites may contain relevant information interacts with the site in order to gather any needed information and prepares a report for the user including detailed product information product comparisons and pricing lists. From the site selling goods the agent may be viewed as in inbound customer.

In essence an agent is both inbound and outbound depending on the perspective of the site. If the site is the initiator of the agent the agent is viewed as outbound. This same agent is viewed as inbound to the sites it interacts with to gather information.

The technology behind agents is continually evolving. Agents generally require more distributed processing and communication capabilities than are currently offered by networking and computing standards such as TCP IP and CORBA. These standards cannot accommodate the flexibility and variety of interaction needed among agents users and other agents and systems. As it is available now middleware support to inter process communication is quite primitive. TCP IP fulfills the necessary transport function Remote Procedure Call RPC and socket libraries allow for the basic exchange of information and invocation of procedures on top of TCP IP and CORBA adds routing names services and data type translation.

Flexible tailorable interactions among agents users and other agents and systems require a language and protocols for specifying or customizing the behavior of agents regardless of their mobility. Some statements of the language will allow flexible interactions with a specific component of the agent interface to services. These service mediators will allow incoming agents to query for the nature of provided services and conditions of their usage. Research is underway on such languages their semantics their syntax and how they should be integrated with agent systems.

Peer to peer computing allows work stations to concurrently send and host multiple requests for services. Security reliability and integrity issues need to be explored especially because the market has high expectations for these areas in client server environments. Asynchronous distributed computing is best handled with mobile agents. Rather than coding a long lasting complex exchange of messages between a client and possibly multiple servers a mobile agent carries a compact program with all the required procedures for the interaction to be executed remotely.

As an option a downloadable sample of the product may also be provided. As another option user created customization of the product may also be allowed. Also compatibility and or equivalence of the product may be evaluated with regards to the items similar to the product.

Optionally a price of the product or the items similar to the product may be generated based on a customer profile a customer type and or a geographic location. Additionally one or more of a special offering and a sale of the product or the items similar to the product may be generated for a customer based on a customer profile a customer type and or a geographic location.

Electronic merchandising introduces a new medium the Internet for merchants to sell their products. As shown in the merchandising component consists of services needed to deliver product pricing and inventory information. These services may directly interact with the personalization services in order to deliver the information in a customized format. A traditional example of this would be window shopping merchandise browsing or any informative interaction with the sales clerk.

There are tremendous benefits in adapting electronic or dynamic merchandising. Listed below are some of the benefits.

There are many different styles and metaphors for electronic merchandising. The basic underlying concept is providing product information to the end user. Product information may include product specifications graphics or video images digital samples or even inventory availability. The approach for displaying this information may differ based on a Business to Consumer or Business to Business implementation. The most common implementation is to use the catalog approach.

The actual storage of the content is important. Product information stored using static HTML aside the most common method is in an object or relational database. Many vendors even provide data models for a product database. Vendor provided data models often will need to be modified in order to meet the specific product detail the system requires. It is important to understand the robustness of the data model as well as the impacts to the system if changes need to be introduced. The system may involve storage and access to many non discrete data types.

In more complex merchandising implementations the content may consist of non discrete data types such as audio and video. The delivery mechanism will need to be able to deliver the data to different access devices. Systems will encounter the need to manage non discrete data types such as audio and video data and alternative content in case the access type cannot handle the data types.

The ability to deliver new products and information may be critical to stay ahead or match the competition. The speed at which the information can be updated and migrated to production is critical. Be sure to understand the relationship between the content changes and the correct procedures to migrate the changes to the production system. The ability to maintain and grow the site may prove to be key factors in the site s success.

In most cases a content staging process should be put in place. In the simplest format the procedures for modifying and adding content testing validation of content and subject matter authorization and migration to production should be documented.

Buyer Centric solutions may need to implement a method of evaluating compatibility and equivalence of products. If the buy site deals with multiple trading partners these functions may provide additional cost savings. Getting buy in from all the trading partners to agree upon a common model for product information is key for this to be successful.

Dynamic pricing is the ability to display a different product price based on a customer profile customer type or any other logical possibility. Ties to personalization may be needed to handle pricing schemes based on relationships terms volumes or other potential customer profile items. It is a good practice to base the information on database technologies that allow for quick retrieval and calculation Note This is definitely a performance conscious area .

In addition the pricing mechanism should be tied to any sort of discounting or promotional incentives. For Business to Business implementations contracts and agreements may be in place to drive the specific pricing. Discounts may be applied on an incremental or time oriented basis. A common concept used are electronic coupons or other types of discounts. The customers may have earned or acquired a coupon or other form of discount earlier in the interaction with the site. The coupon usually stored on the user s machine may be applied to the purchased products.

In addition to catalog navigation the ability to search for specific products is crucial. Assuming the site is a seller centric site there are numerous methods of implementing a product search

Product Sampling Products able to be sampled over the Internet will sell well there. Music is one example. A shopper can listen to pieces of songs on a CD before deciding to order it.

Some applications may require the ability for custom part creation or the combination of individual components the user can combine to fulfill a specific hard to manage need. Part compatibility and pricing can become very complex and unmanageable.

It is important to keep in mind international considerations when designing the merchandising component. The obvious considerations are related to converting currency and linguistics. In addition to these there are hidden pitfalls of specific customs that may unknowingly be violated. Sales of some goods may also be banned in certain countries.

As with designing any site the layout design and navigation aspects are extremely important. The home page or entrance to the site is crucial. There is often a debate as to what level of clutter and organization is desirable. It is a good practice to research a potential user s current standard practices for site design and layout.

The analysis of the profile may occur in real time. The user may also be identified by using a cookie receiving user input and digital certificates. As an option a time when the user last viewed the contents may also be identified with portions of the contents that have been modified or added since the time when the user last viewed the contents being indicated. As another option the user may also be allowed to rate the contents.

Further a potential customer may be selected from a plurality of users and an act may be performed to entice the potential customer to become a real customer. Also an activity may further be conducted to retain a current customer and a demand generating application may be provided.

Enterprises must respond by capitalizing on the new potential the interactive mediums offer to reach communicate and interact with customers. The way enterprises interact with their customers continues to change due to demand for increased convenience better access higher levels of interactivity and faster fulfillment. As a result more customer interactions are done through electronic means e.g. home PCs automated teller machines automated voice response 800 numbers and the Internet . Regardless of the particular medium the customer chooses it is clear future communications will be increasingly technology enabled and information intensive and will provide the foundation for a continuous two way dialogue with customers.

The benefits of new media and communications technologies to interact are numerous enabling enterprises to provide better customer service to capture valuable information about customer behavior and product use and to allow greater differentiation at the point of contact. However most next generation customer interfaces continue to be designed to be high tech rather than high touch.

The Relationship Management section of the Ecaf shown in covers applications and architecture components geared toward capitalizing on the interaction with the customer. Within relationship management there are two main driving forces Interactive Marketing and Personalization .

Personalization is the continuous process of collecting analyzing and using information about the end user in order to improve the productivity and value of their interaction with the organization.

The purpose of personalization is to interact with the customer user with the hopes of establishing and building a relationship increasing sales by catering to the individual customer s needs cross selling or up selling and enticing users to return to the site. Unlike any other broadcast medium the Internet was designed for two way interaction hence providing the ability to narrow cast or customize the interaction to the individual user.

Generating demand for a site s products or services and building customer relationships are crucial for any eCommerce implementation. This is even more evident in seller centric implementations and hype or marketing driven implementations. The customization can occur in many forms. The services and infrastructure can vary drastically depending on the extent of personalization desired. Each eCommerce package may approach personalization using different services and infrastructure.

The enterprise complexity of the personalization approach will drive the architecture components and application required to implement and deliver this strategy. It is critical for the enterprise success to understand how the personalization strategy will affect the entire enterprise.

The conceptual personalization architecture is independent of enterprise or industry. Implementing a personalization strategy into an existing system or a new one requires the design and development of personalization architecture components. These components are essential to the success of the personalization strategy. They include an Identification component to identify the user Information Capture component to capture information about the user Content Catalog component to manage the different contents in the system Matching component to match the user s profile attributes with the correct content Merge Deliver component to deliver the content to the user and an Optimization Administration component to continuously optimize the personalization interaction and administrate the rules and content as they change or added. See . By way of example the conceptual personalization architecture components illustrated in will be discussed in detail in the subcomponents of this component.

There is currently a lot of hype and press attention centered on the idea of personalization . Given the wide variety of products and ideas being labeled personalization it is apparent that a variety of different personalization delivery techniques and technologies are evolving. As with most emerging concepts the initial techniques cover a wide range of complexity in both infrastructure and approach. Most personalized sites use a combination of techniques. Samplings of personalization techniques are presented below 

This is acknowledging the user or greeting them with a personalized statement. The statement may be a simple Welcome back message or it may be more complex drawing on information from the last interaction.

In this approach the application or web site s user interface is customized for the individual. The actual page layout or page design is altered based on the individual interacting with the system. This category can be sub divided based on who the site or the user controls how the interface is altered.

This technique filters the information or content displayed to the user based on what is entered by or known about the user. Many personalized sites use some form of content filtering. A variety of different filtering techniques have emerged. Some are adaptations of traditional client server techniques adapted to the Web. In the first grouping of techniques presented here the user controls how the information is filtered.

This technique simplifies a complex process or repetitive task by storing the user s preferences and inputs required to complete the process. In most cases a series of pre defined questions and preferences have to be set up in order to use this functionality. 1 Click purchasing can be offered which allows a user to select an item with a single click and purchase the item by passing the order selection order form shipping and payment pages. A Fastpath approach can be used where the user has performed the function before and allowed the application or web site to retain more static information like shipping address.

In situations where user data is required to complete an action the site can use information that it currently has about the user to pre fill the form. For example the site may fill out the order form with the user s last address and order information or the site may fill out the list of items ordered last. This approach differs from Fastpathing in that the user still sees the pre filled form and has the opportunity to change the data.

The site provides an interactive assistant to deliver personalized help and assistance . Its purpose is to help the user with difficult actions and site functionality. Based on observing and recording how often if ever the user has used a give function within the site tips suggestions and other forms of assistance can be fine tuned to the user s level of experience.

Most of the personalization techniques described above are interactive personalization techniques. Content and information is personalized for the user in real time while the user interacts with the application or site. Some forms of personalization can also be used in a non interactive or push mode

 Push or server push is where the delivery of information to a user on the Web is triggered and initiated by the information server rather than by the user.

In fact the information pushed from a server to a user actually comes as the result of a subscription like standing request created by the user and either stored on the server or on their local machine. This program captures and stores the user s profile locally and then periodically initiates requests for information on the user s behalf from the server.

Push technologies enable an enterprise to reach and provide value to their customer outside of the traditional interactions. Of the personalization techniques described above content filtering doesn t require that it be delivered though an interactive session. Keep in mind that push does not necessarily mean personalized. A site may simple push the same information to all users or subscribers. Personalized push refers to information that is filtered based on a specific user s request or profile or where the delivery is scheduled for a specific user. There are a variety of different legitimate business reasons to push a users information. The following are some examples of personalized push 

Don t be a junk e mailer. The push medium is powerful and potentially less costly than conventional mail. This doesn t justify its use as junk mail. It does not work because everyone receives junk mail and junk mail that ends up in the trash is failed target marketing efforts. Personalize it. Deliver valuable information that the customer is interested in. Allow them to select the topics how to filter the content and the frequency.

Personalization is actually a catchall for several underlying technology capabilities needed to create a personalized interaction between an organization and a user. By breaking the underlying technology and logic into simpler components one can build an understanding of the processes and technology needed to deliver personalized applications.

Personalization is the continuous process of collecting analyzing and using end user information in order to improve the productivity and value of their interaction with the organization. Implicit in this definition is the need to do a number of basic things. Simply put there needs to be some method for identifying the user collecting or detecting and storing user information analyzing it assessing what content or functionality is appropriate and present it to the user.

Personalization will continue to be adopted by the market place. Numerous sites have incorporated personalization techniques into their sites and the marketplace is full of independent software vendors creating personalization related software.

Each enterprise must assess their personalization opportunities from their own perspective and develop their own personalization strategy. The personalization strategy must be integrated with the enterprise s existing customer relationship technology and eCommerce strategies.

Using the Opportunity matrix given below the opportunities where personalization typically delivers the most value in within the Interact domain. This area consists of opportunities where the organization is interacting with the user or the user is attempting to engage in a dialog. The publishing slice and Knowledge Management aspects of the Interact slice are the areas which are typically the secondary areas of personalization opportunity with the transact slice being last.

When evaluating what opportunities exists all areas should be considered. The value of the personalized interaction will be dependent on many factors such as the type of products and services can they be personalized or the type of relationship with the customer or consumer and the ability to capture user information.

A formal personalization strategy should be established that included the near term goals and future vision. Many companies jump right in without any guidance or realization on how they are growing or enhancing the enterprise. The strategy should begin with the big picture. Perform an examination of the critical forces affecting the enterprise and how these forces affect the business process. What are the drivers Society marketing technology business industry With the personalization market emerging there are still with many unproven business cases and unproven technology. Firms should not engage in personalization simple because they can nor should they fall prey to the unproven expectations generated by vendors or marketing hype. Firms considering personalization must frame personalization in the context of true enterprise goals increasing customer retention or increase customer extension then determine how personalization will help accomplish these goals.

The personalization strategy should evaluate the complexity of the personalization the cost and time to implement and the potential business impact. In many cases a true one to one personalized site may not make sense. Creating millions of varieties of a product will only complicate the interaction to the point that the user is overwhelmed. In some cases engaging in simple personalized dialogues may be the best near and midterm solutions.

Since different users may wish to interact differently there may be many right answers to the personalization strategy. Some users are self serving and want to have the tools to explore or make choices on their own others want immediacy others may want intimacy such that their feed back and options register with the company. See for a graphical depiction of personalization from no customization at to one on one personalization at .

The type of dialog that the site engages with the user may vary based on the user. In some cases no personalization or customization should be performed. As more information is captured on the user the correct type of dialog should be assessed. Determining the correct touch points and level of complexity of the personalization techniques is an important part of the enterprise s personalization strategy.

The architecture components and processes will differ depending on the type of personalization technique implemented. For each technique there are important considerations and differences that should be understood. Each technique will vary in approach information required and delivery. The following items should be considered 

These questions can be answered in many ways. The impact the answers have is dependent on the enterprise and its personalization strategy.

The first task of the personalization engine is to identify the user. Unlike the everyday person to person interactions where a person relies on recognizing the another s face voice or other attributes to identify the other person identifying a user on line can be a difficult process. The simple task of identifying users does not prove to be a simple task at all. A system may personalize an interaction based on the information captured during a single session or information gathered over the entire duration of the relationship. Regardless the information that is captured needs to be associated with the user. In order to track a user an identification or tracking mechanism needs to be created.

A variety of techniques can be used to identify the user. The technique may depend on the site s security requirement and privacy concerns. Today the most common approaches are to either create a cookie on the client machine or to have an identification system on the server such as a user login. In the future digital certificates will be more prevalent and should become the dominant identification method.

A Cookie is a small text file placed on the client machine s hard drive by a Web server. It is essentially a user s identification card and cannot execute code or deliver viruses. It is unique to the user and can only be used by the server that issued it. Although this is a common method for identifying a user there are many risks associated with it.

This technique requires the user to log in or sign on to the site. This requires the creation of a user ID and password to utilize the system and the resources needed to validate and store the ID and password. With this technique the user must remember their log in name and password. Additional services to lookup log in names or request new passwords should also be provided.

In every day life people carry different forms of identification a person s on line identity may be no different. Modern cryptographic technology offers certificates or digital IDs that will serve as electronic forms of identification. Digital certificates are still evolving and the key players and details on how the pieces tie together are still falling into place.

One example of an effective use of a certificate is Firefly Passport. There the certificate is tied to a list of user profile information. Microsoft purchased Firefly for this technology. The name is apt to change over time. The Firefly Passport gives users an application with which to control their personal information and payment details. The information can be dispensed selectively to third parties to use.

A combination of techniques may also be used. The cookie may be used for the initial identification or the default ID for the Log in process while the server side log in process would then be used to verify the identity of the user. It is important to make this process seamless and unobtrusive. The identification process should fade in the background. It should be present yet invisible and unobtrusive.

Creating a log in or sign in process introduces the traditional problem of multiple log ins or ID s from a site or enterprise perspective. If a user forgets their login they may simply create a new one. This may result in multiple logins for the user and any information related to the previous login is not associated to the user s new one. To prevent this a facility to look up existing login names or request a new password should be provided.

As in the client server world a single or universal log in is advised especially for systems that wish to personalize their site s interaction. If the enterprise already has an existing user base pushing out IDs to users or allowing the ability to re use the existing ID should be encouraged. For example United Airlines created a PIN Personal Identification Number for each of their Mileage Plus members that provided access to the Mileage Plus section of their Web site and pushed physically mailed this out to the respective user. The PIN was their mileage plus number with a password associated with it. By doing this they were able to reuse their existing identification process and login IDs.

The personalization process is data intensive and is driven by the information collected about the system s users. The more information the site collects and retains about a user the more likely it can add value and interact on a personalized level. With out this crucial data there is no basis to shape the interaction or drive the personalization techniques.

The information collected about a user is considered the user s profile. Logically this is everything the enterprise site knows about the user. Attributes from the user s profile will be the input to the personalization process and the driving data for the different personalization techniques. A profiling strategy should be developed by the enterprise that addresses what information to capture the sources of this information the methods to capture it and how this information will be stored. If the customer is to be treated the same at all points of interaction a common profile should be developed that is shared by all departments and applications.

Determining what information to capture or what attributes make up the user s profile can be a difficult process. In most cases the profile will be based on the enterprise s personalization strategy the personalization techniques to be implemented the data required to implement them and a mix of any user information deemed usable that can be captured. In general the site needs to capture the information required to perform the analysis aspect of the personalization process for each of the personalization technique to be implemented. This information might include 

Each personalization technique may require a different set of attributes from the user s profile. The information needed to deliver a Site Controlled Contextual Inferences will be very different than the information needed for pre filled forms. Site Controlled Contextual Inferences Content Filtering requires the creation of rules and the necessary user information that satisfy the rules or Contextual Inferences . The information required to satisfy a rule is referred to as Personalization Matching Factors PMFs and will be discussed in more detail in the Matching Logic component. For instance the rule may be based on gender age purchase history or customer demographics. On the other hand the information that is used to Pre Fill forms may be a different set of user profile attributes. For example this might be name address shipping information and payment information. Another personalization technique may use the same set of user information or may require another subset of user data.

Physically this data may come from many sources within the enterprise. Information may be gathered directly from the user s interaction with the personalized site through implicit or explicit information gathering techniques. Information may be used from other data sources such as existing application s transactional data the enterprises data warehouse or from other internal or external data sources.

The situation should be analyzed to determine if the profile data should be replicated and stored in additional profile tables or if it should remain within the existing data source. Some personalization techniques will require additional tables to store the user s profile attributes needed to deliver the personalization technique. This will be discussed in more detail within the Matching section of the paper.

The industry has recognized the importance of personalization and the requirement of a user profile information to deliver personalization. To date a profiling standard or definition of a common User Profile does not exist. This means that each site will be required to capture and retain its own set of profile information. From a user s perspective this introduces additional annoyance since they will be prompted by personalized sites for the same basic information. The Open Profiling Standard has been proposed to address this issue.

The Internet Privacy Working Group IPWG began to develop the Platform for Privacy Preferences P3P . P3P extends the Platform for Internet Content Selection PICS standard with notice and consent capabilities to enable automatic negotiation of preferences policies and information exchange. If P3P settings are accurate Web surfers should be able to surf at will and only see P3P notices when they stray out of bounds of what is already approved in the profile.

Netscape FireFly Network Inc. and VeriSign have introduced Open Profiling Standard OPS a proposed standard that helps to address the issues of multiple profiles. This proposed standard would provide Internet site developers with a uniform way of getting users Personal Profile information in order to personalize interaction. The OPS is a standard being worked on as part of the World Wide Web Consortium s Platform for Privacy Preferences http www.w3c.org . It is compatible with the existing vCard and X.509 digital certificate technology standards which allow for user identification and authentication over the Web.

Individuals will have a Personal Profile that contains their personal information including their names e mail address mailing address and any other information they wish to provide. This profile will be stored on their personal computer or securely stored in a corporate wide or global directory . The first time that an individual visits a Web site that supports OPS the Web site will request information from the Personal Profile. To protect their privacy users can decide whether they want all or part of the information to be given to publishers and which ones can see it. In addition if the Web site collects additional information about the individual s preferences it can with the individual s permission store that information in the Personal Profile for future use.

Users have the ability to selectively release or withhold information in their Personal Profiles rather than the all or nothing process of accepting or rejecting cookies that the user cannot examine. OPS gives individuals both more flexibility and more control over personal information than cookies can.

Once the profile strategy has been defined and the sources have been identified the next step is capturing the information. In many cases the information comes from existing data sources. In these cases the data may require refinement or replication. The remaining information can be captured directly from the user s interaction with the site.

In most cases the user will control the personalization process or technique. In these cases the user is aware of the personalization technique and chooses to use the interface that will deliver it. For example a configured interface such as My Yahoo requires the user to select the layout and topics they wish to display on the personalized page. The configuration or setup interface captures the needed information and adds this to the user s logical profile.

On the other end of the spectrum are information capture techniques that the site controls. The site collects information about the interaction. The interactive information capture techniques can be categorized as explicit or implicit.

Explicit information capture usually provides an interface to collect profile information. The site explicitly asks the user to provide the information. Examples of explicit information capture techniques are 

Implicit Techniques gather information about the interaction without directly asking the user. In essence the site is recording the interaction in search of useful information. The user may be unaware that the site is capturing information. The most common implicit technique is clickstream analysis. The site records the user s actions what they clicked on or where they navigated to the content displayed time spent or the duration a graphic was displayed. The information gathered is then analyzed for patterns and trends.

The goal of a personalized site is to increase the value of the interaction of the user with the organization. Unfortunately the site has the potential to do the opposite. The personalization aspects of the site could actually offend or deter customers. The approach the site uses for information capture will play a large part in the personalized site s success. The following are some items to be aware of when capturing user profile information 

Today the Web content of most sites is unmanaged. The enterprise does not utilize a method of tracking the content or the attributes of the content. Instead the enterprise has a pool of content that may span multiple directories departments and web servers. When content is created it is added to this pool of content by simply adding it to the Web server s directory and adding the necessary link required to display it. The content within this pool may be duplicated outdated or unused. In short the enterprise has no idea of the extent of the content or information about the attributes of the content.

Unmanaged content may be an obstacle for personalization. In order to deliver personalized content or filtered content the system must know what content exists and the attributes of this content. A content catalog or content management system should be used to manage the enterprise s content. A simple definition of a content catalog is given below.

What is deemed as content can take many forms. As illustrated in content may be Web pages HTML pages graphics images audio video or even information and messages. How this content is stored may also take many forms it may be stored in table files or directories. The content catalog needs to be aware of what content exists and where it is stored. This can be achieved by retaining attributes of the content and providing indexing to the content. Content attributes might be physical properties such as what type of content it is HTML page graphic audio file video file or textual message or the size of the content. The difficulty is attempting to store the heuristic or analytical attributes and making these attributes available for personalization techniques. The indexing strategy should include full text and attribute indexing which provides efficient access for the enterprise s users and potentially any integrated members of the enterprise s value chain.

This personalization component needs to provide the intelligence to match the user s profile attributes with the correct content and deliver this content to the user. Bridging the profile information to the content is truly the heart of the personalization architecture. A variety of different approaches can be implemented to accomplish this task. The complexity of this matching logic is directly proportional to how flexible robust and dynamic the personalization aspects of the site are.

The Match concept is the process of analyzing the information that is known about the user and determining the correct content to display to them. Once the user profile attributes have been identified they must be applied against the rules or matching logic defined within the site in order to determine the appropriate content to display. Three inputs are required in order to complete the Match process 

A simple example of this matching logic is a defined query. The site may provide the logic for a user to view their account information. In this case the profile information is their user ID or account number the rule is the defined query SELECT account info FROM Account where Acct Id User Acct Id and the content is the user s account information stored in Account table. If the content is stored in a relational or object database SQL queries are an effective method of accessing this data. In this case the defined rule takes the form of a SQL statement. Unfortunately most of the content is not stored in relational databases or is not directly related to something as simple as a user s account ID. Instead the content is web pages or massive amounts of news feeds and textual information. These situations require a different and possibly more complex approach and infrastructure to perform the matching logic. In this environment the rules are usually composed of Personalization Matching Factors PMFs .

A Personalization Matching Factor PMF is the building block for a rule. It is the information required to perform the matching aspect of the personalization process. This is the demographic psychographic sociographic or any other information that will be needed to drive the personalization process. A PMF might be as simple as the user s gender or a complex attribute such as driver type that is derived from a group of data. Included in the definition of the PMF should be the definition necessary to create it.

Developing PMFs will require involvement of the Marketing department and other business entities that understand the customer strategy and the enterprise s customers. It is important to understand the customer needs what the customer expects and what makes a difference to them when determining and creating PMFs.

PMFs should be restricted to information that can be realistically captured by the site as well as information that is reliable and accurate. Conceptually a PMF can be any piece of derived or any conceived information. For example a PMF could be the user s gender age marital status number of children the number of years they have been a customer their profession driving record interests such as sports travel or other leisure activities favorite color a personality trait such as if they are detail oriented or pessimistic in nature or any otherdemographic psychographic sociographic piece of information. How would this information be captured What are the attributes that would be used to derive this What is the accuracy of this information Why is this PMF used to personalize These are the types of questions that need to be asked when determining possible PMFs.

A PMF needs to have a clear definition and a finite list of possibilities. For example a site may create a PMF called Age Classification . The site would need to define what it means by the PMF Age Classification . For this example age classification is simple a logical group of users based on their age. The values would be 

A PMF may also be a combination of low level data. If a PMF of Insurance Risk were created the required data would be far more than age. It would need to include age driving history vehicle region and potentially other data.

The PMFs are the building blocks for rules and matching logic. Unlike SQL extensions there is no industry standard method for accessing Web content and creating rules. Some approaches are detailed below.

The examples above are mainly site controlled. The site either has a pre defined rule or matching logic that will execute. The site is responsible for determining what has been learned from the interaction what is enabled based on the knowledge gained what additional information will provide additional insight. Where possible the users should be allowed to define the rules and matching logic or the content they wish to view. Provide the user the structure to create a rule or define a query.

Defining legitimate business rules and models is as important as the infrastructure to evaluate them. The rule may execute and content may be delivered but if the rule doesn t make good business sense the effort is wasted. Business and marketing personnel should be involved in defining the rules and verifying that they are correctly translated and technically implemented. This is another reason that the personalization team should include individuals from IT the business and marking departments. The team needs to understand their existing and potential customer the content available and when and why to display it.

The rules for matching logic should be defined as stand alone entities so that they may be reused in multiple situations. Each situation may associate the same rule to a different interaction and a different set of content. The matching logic should be associated with a template or interaction and content should be associated with a rule result or condition of the matching logic.

One possible method of associating a rule and content to an interaction is by using a Dynamic Content Area DCA . A DCA is embedded with a template and points to a specific rule and a rule results set will be associated with specific content. For example a page may be explaining a particular service to a current user. The site may wish to display on the page a graphic that the user can relate to along with a list of benefits that are personalized to the user and finally list discounts that the user might be qualified for.

A separate DCA would be used for each set of data. illustrates an exemplary template with three DCAs embedded within the template.

During the design of the site a decision must be made to determine which areas of the site will provide personalized content to the user the rules to use and matching logic associated with it and what content should be displayed for each rule result. Since there is no face to face interaction with the user identifying the content to use is very important. The web site must make the users feel as though they are being communicated directly. Once the page is requested or encountered by the user the page is generated and each DCA will request that a rule be executed and the content should be generated according to the user profile.

The normal delivery method of the content is through the use of HTTP. This method will be used to deliver the majority of the content. There are other methods of delivery that may be considered depending upon the content to be delivered. Other delivery methods includes e mail FTP Push or Channels and streaming video. Since timing of the delivery is very important consideration must be given to developing a method of delivery that provides the most impact to the user and does so in a timely manner.

Personalization is difficult for a number of reasons but the biggest gotcha is that above all it requires dedicated maintenance staff. While much of the process of personalization can be automated the construction of the business rules used to match content to visitors and the creation of the metadata tags required to classify all content still require a tremendous amount of human oversight. The need for such oversight is only compounded by the fact that personalization becomes exponentially more complex as the number of visitors and amount of available content increases. The net result is that firms that decide to engage in personalization without ramping up staff adequately will fail.

Personalization is a continuous process. It is not an application that is delivered and then left unmonitored or forgotten about. Personalization techniques will need to be added removed and modified. Rules content and messages will change. Most enterprises fail to measure their return on investments or to directly attribute customer behavior to certain initiatives. As a result the enterprise often invests in initiatives promotions and campaigns without understanding how they will affect product or customer profitability. Procedures measurement and reporting devices and metrics need to be created to allow for the enterprise to evaluate and improve their personalized interactions and deliver their customer strategy. The site may provide the customer a chance to make a purchasing decision. If they decide not to make this purchase what is the reason why The enterprise should attempt to gather information on why this result occurs and seek to prevent it in the future. The following optimization and administration components should be considered for a personalized site 

With the emergence of interactive mediums and the inherent capability to gather real time information about the customer interacting with the medium enterprise s marketing strategies and systems are becoming more customer centric. With the move from mass or targeted marketing to a form of customer centric marketing enterprises must evaluate their customer relationship model.

Traditionally marketing models tended to focus exclusively on customer acquisition mass marketing and then on customer selection micromarketing and target marketing . However several studies have shown it costs between four and 10 times as much to acquire a profitable customer as it does to retain one. This awareness has resulted in a heightened emphasis on customer retention and extension and has been the driving force of relationship marketing.

However customer retention and extension are less dependent on traditional marketing and are more tied to the value perceived by the customer during every interaction with the enterprise. In addition these strategies require a different marketing infrastructure that is information and customer driven rather than product and creative driven. Thus relationship marketing is somewhat of a misnomer as adding value to the customer relationship is not simply a marketing challenge but rather a challenge involving every function within the enterprise. This business model calls for enterprises to differentiate themselves by consistently providing superior service at every point of contact with the customer.

The ShARE Selection Acquisition Retention and Extension customer relationship model is detailed in . See also . This model addresses the changes in the shift to interactive marketing. Due to the emergence of interactive mediums today s systems now have the ability to address all areas of the ShARE model.

The selection portion of the ShARE model deals with determining who within the general population will be a company s most profitable customers. Selection deals with determining who makes up a product s target audience and allows a company to focus their attention more accurately. This is the area where demographic information such as age geography and income are applied to produce a more finite list of likely customers. The selection process allows businesses to make strategic decisions such as NOT to market a snow shovel in Ecuador.

Acquisition focuses on getting a potential customer to use one s service or buy one s product in the most efficient way. This area has traditionally focused on mass marketing and measuring a business cost per thousands of consumers reached. The classic example of acquisition is Proctor Gamble s use of daytime television dramas in the United States to sell soap creating what is now called the soap opera. Other methods of acquisition include direct mailings telephone solicitation toll free order numbers and more recently Internet advertising and online businesses.

Capitalizing on the two way interaction and an audience of the general public advertising is often utilized on applications deployed on the Internet. In a browser based implementation the use of frames or banners creates the possibility to dedicate a section of the display to advertising. With most of marketing capabilities the advertising model services can vary from simple static advertisements to a robust advertising integrated with the personalized system. The implementation methods may range from an advertisement Applet to advertising services integrated with the personalization system. Detailed below are possible services included in a complex advertising implementation.

As online advertising and its supporting technology matures new advertising methods will emerge. For example the use of intermercial sometimes referred to as interstitial meaning intertwined ads that automatically pop up between pages may prove to be the next method of choice. It is important to ensure the advertising services remain flexible and are able to address the evolving technology used to implement advertising.

Now that companies know it is cheaper to hang on to existing customers than to find new ones more and more emphasis is being placed on customer retention. Retention focuses on keeping customers for as long as possible. The most effective way to do this is to provide excellent customer service at each and every interaction with the customer. Since electronic business don t provide traditional customer service it is important web based businesses have sites with appropriate support functionality. The support should be easy to use and meet the specific needs of that product s consumers.

Recommendation functions may take up multiple formats. The most common format are simple services to allow the site s users to provide direct feedback positive or negative and recommendations about the content or products on the site. By providing these services the site may create a community where users can interact with each other furthering the site s worth. For example a site could allow for users to submit book reviews The information is then available for consumption by the general public. While the technology to implement this is rather simple the process may prove to be a little more complex. The process includes receiving input reviewing recommendations filtering and approving content and then posting the review or recommendations. The lack of a filtration or review process could be devastating to a site.

Another type of recommendation service makes suggestions to its user base. These services can range from simple to complex. A more complex recommendation service may utilize collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is the technique of using content or product ratings from the site s user base to predict the interest other potential users will have in the content or products. Correlation algorithms use the profile information history and or input preferences to construct a correlation group of users whose ratings are effective predictors for the new user. Prediction algorithms then use the ratings and profile information of the users to make predictions of the content they most likely will find interesting. Note The collaborative filtering technique could be implemented within the personalization system. 

Additional relationship building techniques are site announcements and reminders. The underlying services are again personalized. The site has created content which may range from new product announcements based on the customer s last visit or reminders of an upcoming event important to the specific customer. For example an event reminder could point out an upcoming wedding personal anniversary or holiday. The user once reminded may then utilize the site to act on the event. If the site implements complex event reminders additional services may be needed to provide calendar and scheduling functionality. These services may also be incorporated with the off site subscription services to provide reminders to users not logged into the site.

Creating an environment that promotes customers to return to the site is critical for the longevity of the site. Many of the seller centric implementations will utilize membership services and other incentive programs to try and promote customers to return. For example site members would receive discounts and additional privileges thus building a better relationship with the site. Incentives like frequent shopper points or access to member only information are other common methods. The loyalty programs may require additional logic for permissions and content filtering. Most of this may be implemented by gathering and using profiles and integration with a complex personalization system.

Return Programs are services geared toward enticing the customer to return to the site. The Internet eliminates two main factors affecting customer loyalty. The first is proximity. In the brick and mortar medium customers tend to shop or browse close to where they live or work. The second factor is time or how long a store is open. With the Internet being 7 by 24 and geographically independent these items are no longer relevant. For this reason considerable effort may be geared toward creating return programs. The most common forms are electronic version of current methods although they may be more effective due to personalization and real time delivery.

This section includes merchandising using email to push information to a user. Note Subscriptions to sites and information are covered in the Order Processing Fulfillment component. Many of the common services for storage filtering formatting and approving content would be utilized. Additional services would be needed to push the content to the desired mailing list. Details and considerations for using push technology is included in application discussing the Netcentric Framework referenced above. Below are some basic services.

Extension asks businesses to answer the question How can one increase the loyalty and profitability of this customer 

Cross Selling and Up Selling are similar to recommendation services. Cross selling uses some knowledge of the consumer to suggest complimentary or similar products in which the consumer may be interested Would you like fries with that Up selling is an effort to sell more of the same thing or a better version of what the consumer may currently be considering Would you like that Super Sized 

Cross selling and up selling are considered an application or service enabled by complex personalization. Although very important from a marketing perspective once the underlying services for complex personalization are in place many of the demand generating applications are now possible. Cross selling or up selling could be implemented by product relationships in a database.

One of the items altered based on the profiles of the users may include price which may be altered to reflect a discount assigned to the user. A search may also be performed for the internal data in the e Commerce system prior to the synchronization of the external data.

As an option load balancing services may also be performed that initiate and stop processes as utilization levels vary in the e Commerce system. As another option managing of the contact information may further include tracking responses to the users of the e Commerce system.

As with any system a support administration and maintenance facility and procedures need to be put in place to remain operational as well as efficient. In general packaged implementations will only provide minimal maintenance and administration facilities leaving the bulk of the burden to the integrator. The underlying technology for the facilities may be basic batch download uploads simple server processes and applications or even browser based. It is important to understand the system administration and maintenance needs develop a plan and stick with it. Some of the areas to consider are listed below. illustrates high level concepts of maintenance and administration of the framework.

The health of a system can be easily maintained by putting in place monitoring facilities and procedures for capturing the system s electronic vital signs. Far too often the users of a system are the first to know of system problems while the administrators are the last to know. This can be prevented by creating automated monitoring facilities for server processes disk space memory CPU utilization access time number of connections and other electronic vital signs. The complexity of these facilities is open for debate. In addition to online monitoring facilities robust logging audit trails and archiving capabilities should be included. These will aid in analysis and forecasting of system needs.

The term system administration is a vague term used to categorize the actions needed to support a system. This may include starting stopping or restarting servers or processes scheduling backups and loads of databases or files recovery procedures or anything else needed to maintain the system. Traditional system administration also includes updates to system software packages and operating systems. Listed below are additional system administration considerations an eCommerce system may encounter.

The merchandising aspect may introduce additional administration and maintenance. Procedures should be put in place to handle sold out merchandise and back order items. Updating merchandising content currency tax and pricing may need to be performed on a regular basis. The merchandise administration facility should be able to handle pricing and discount items and have the ability to allow automatic updating and manual override capabilities for authorized administrators.

The biggest challenges in personalization are determining matching rules for the business s market plans categorization of the profiles gathering profile information and then developing robust content with adequate content indexing. Once these have been established they should be easily maintained. When designing the personalization services maintenance of the rules and content should be considered. The people most likely driving this information will not be technology oriented and may require simple interfaces for altering rules for marketing advertising or other personalized content.

As content is added this information will need to be indexed and integrated with the search technology implemented at the site. Other items such as customer service chat discussions or review would also need to be purged on a regular basis.

Many times utilizing packages to implement an eCommerce solution will introduce a proprietary data model for customer and product information. In order to make this information accessible to the rest of the organization the information will need to be synchronized with the enterprise data. Services may be required to determine changes and synchronize the data. This would be true for any information the site gathers not integrated into the enterprise data.

In addition to the monitoring and maintenance facilities services should be considered to stabilize performance. Providing the system is scalable load balancing services would aid in initiating and stopping extra processes as utilization levels vary. Processes could be started to handle additional requests during peek periods providing the user with a consistent level of performance. This is extremely important in periods of peak usage. A good example is the fluctuation of the average response times of some of the current electronic trading systems during market surges. Times during a market surge were 2 3 minutes above their average 6 10 second response time.

Internet users are quick to point out mistakes and opinions for improvements. Sites will receive sporadic emails from users experiencing a variety of emotions about the site. Users may sour quickly if actions are not taken or noted to items pointed out. Responses to user feedback should be monitored to ensure that each message from a user is responded to in some manner.

Maintenance and Administration of the system is often wrongfully overlooked. It is a key component in improving customer satisfaction and building customer relationships. Having robust maintenance and administration facilities should increase the system s overall stability by reducing the time and cost to identify and fix issues automating processes and enabling system administers.

The ability to deliver new products and information may be critical to stay ahead or match the competition. The speed at which the information can be updated and migrated to production is critical. Be sure to understand the relationship between the content changes and the correct procedures to migrate the changes to the production system. The ability to maintain and grow the site may prove to be key factors in the site s success.

In most cases a content staging process should be put in place. In the simplest format the procedures for modifying and adding content testing validation of content and subject matter authorization and migration to production should be documented.

A medium for receiving the payment may be via credit based payment debit based payment and or electronic cash. Additionally verification of export restrictions with respect to a selected product may also be allowed.

As an option the ability to review update and cancel the order at any time may be allowed. As another option electronic rights may also be managed. In even a further option order tracking information about a status of the order may also be provided.

Allowing customers the ability to not just browse and interact but complete the purchased is crucial for a successful eCommerce solution. This section includes many of the capabilities needed to negotiate and perform the entire transaction. The transaction begins when the user takes action to purchase the item s . From a seller centric view the transaction is initiated once the purchase button is selected. The buy transaction may include sub transactions such as totaling payment selection inventory management and purchase authorization.

It is important to recognize some commerce packages specialize in the transaction processing portion of an eCommerce solution. For example Open Market s OM Transact does not provide a catalog interface or any of the infrastructure for interaction with the potential customer. Instead it will provide an interface for communicating with its transactional infrastructure.

Each implementation will require specific flow and business logic. The commerce packages available today provide generic order processing business capabilities that will need to be customized to achieve the specific needs of the business. Illustrated in is an example flow of business capabilities needed for complete order processing on an eCommerce implementation. The process begins with operation which allows browsing and interacting in order to permit selection of merchandise in operation . The process ends in operation with settlement.

Some sort of merchandise collection facility is needed. All items of interest should be gathered and organized so they can be reviewed prior to purchase. The most common approaches are an order form or a metaphor such as a shopping cart or basket.

The check out phase begins once the user has decided to purchase or order the items gathered. A variety of capabilities may be required or may affect this process. Listed below are some of the services to consider during the check out processing.

Given the geographically independent environment and multitude of potential customer relationships many factors may affect the actual pricing. The first step in the transaction is determining the price. The price in most cases will be dynamically generated based on the actual price of the items taxes fulfillment or delivery costs and any other item affecting the price. Ideally product prices shipping and handling charges and other charges should be maintained separately. This functionality should include the ability to handle tax exempt customers and transactions. Sales tax and value added tax logging and auditing capabilities should also be included.

In general pricing is calculated dynamically. Discounts may be applied for many reasons either to specific items or to the entire order. Additional discounts may be given for using a preferred payment mechanism. Other implementations may provide discounts at the end of month based on total sales.

The tax issues related to the buying and selling of tangible personal property or services through the Internet are numerous and complex. Questions include what products and services are subject to tax when and where to impose a tax on the retail transaction and what tax sales or use the merchant is required to collect. Tax calculation functions with an integrated sales tax or value added tax VAT engine able to perform real time calculations based on customer specified product codes order point of origin shipper s address or recipient s address should be considered.

Due to these complexities most solutions interface with a tax engine to reduce the risk and legalities involved with taxes. Most of the commerce packages available today interface with the leading tax engines.

Shipping charges may be applicable for items not fulfilled directly by the site. In some cases the customer s shipping location may be used to determine their taxes and shipping charges. There are a variety of mechanisms for determining shipping charges. They include 

Other basic order information may be gathered during the check out processing. The most common method is an order form. The form should be easily customizable and may contain a variety of information.

After a total has been established a payment method must be determined. A variety of mediums can handle the transfer of money. The methods flow technology and potentially messaging will vary by implementation. Issues concerning security liability and relationship to fulfillment need to be worked out.

There are a multitude of different vendors and technologies available for handling electronic payments. The infrastructure process and technology may vary dramatically from vendor to vendor. The actual mediums for the current payment options fall into these categories 

The fulfillment process can be complex and will vary depending on the type of goods being delivered. Integration to existing systems as well as communication of invoices and orders to distributors or trading partners will play an important role.

A tremendous amount of communication and back end processing will be needed. Often implementing an eCommerce environment opens the doors to review the underlying systems and processes. Potential areas include warehouse notifications and P.O. delivery. Print fax or sneaker net systems may be upgraded to EDI email or another electronic medium. Updating and improving these processes will be critical for providing customer support. Users will come to expect the ability to see the progress of their order as it moves from the site to warehouse to their desktop.

Soft goods may take the form of information software graphics music or any other digital content. Many traditional content providers have imported their content to the Internet. Although the revenue generation is less than what they achieve through their traditional channels of distribution publishers and other entertainment providers have found the Internet offers a richer more interactive environment to present their content. The Internet provides consumers the ability to search evaluate transact and personalize the content. The Internet will continue to be adopted as an effective distribution channel.

A very simplistic form of soft goods fulfillment may be achieved by allowing the user access to the site. Functions to handle permissions and access would be required to prevent unauthorized users or actions.

A site subscription may be based on different metering technologies. Internet metering technologies can be divided into two categories observational metering and usage metering. Observation metering measures site activity while usage metering measures the usage of items such as files bytes or time.

Owners of digital content including authors and publishers have been searching for a method to protect against the unauthorized distribution of their works over the Internet. Most content available on the Internet today is freely distributed often without consideration of the content owner s copyrights and appropriate royalties. Protecting Web content is a difficult task. Items such as copyrighted words images and other digital objects need to be protected from unauthorized and endless duplication. Currently copyright notices can easily be stripped away. There are a few recent developments aimed at tracking rights violations.

Some rights management methods are geared toward identifying legal and illegal uses of a document or digital object. These concepts still require actively searching the Web for signs of abuse. In essence the methods still allow the content to be extracted and used basing the majority of the security on trust. Other approaches place a security wrapper around the content so it can only be accessed by authorized users.

The information capable of being searched may include product information and also a status of the order. Also the customer may communicate with the customer service representative by way of a chat room.

As an option the purchase history information may also be compiled and displayed. As another option information including policy documentation may also be provided. As an additional option an on line bulletin board may be provided for allowing input from a plurality of customers.

This category includes any component of the solution meeting a user s need normally filled by a human customer service representative. These services fall across the marketing merchandising order processing and other categories. The customer service aspect of eCommerce is as important as selling the actual products. Just as in the world of the paper bill a lack of customer service or poor customer service can destroy any relationship the user has established with the electronic business.

Conducting commerce on the Internet means allowing direct access to the system and its data. New users may have a much lower tolerance for hard to understand interfaces and site layout and may require considerable help understanding what information exists on the site and how to find it. Customer service will continue to be a key component in maintaining customer relationships.

There are a variety of different services to enhance customer service. Which services should be implemented are dependent on the goals and characteristics of the site. Below are listed the key customer services which are also found in .

Search engines have become a popular component of any information intensive site. The ability to lead a user to the type of information he is looking for will not only make the interaction more efficient but enhance the customer relationships. Search is a generic term and may be used for searching for a specific product or may be implemented to search for a specific customer s order or other information.

Providing customers the ability to track their orders can provide tremendous benefits in reduction of support personnel and building customer relationships. Applications of this nature can range from simple to complex depending on the level of detail. The order tracking system should be integrated within the order processing s innate workflow system. Purchase history functions may also be provided.

If the site sells goods there is always the possibility of the customer returning the merchandise. As with most exception processing this can create numerous problems though the return should be allowed. Actually crediting a smartcard or replacing digital currency may be very difficult. The legalities and procedures should be thought out and documentation provided.

There is a tremendous amount of help and information features a site may provide. Listed below are some of the more common examples.

Behind security one of the leading reasons a customer will not transact online is the lack of human contact. Although unbelievable to most technologists there is still an underlying fear of computers hidden in a large percentage of the potential consumer base. Currently most seller centric sites do not provide a truly two way interactive or collaborative environment. The site may have a complex form of personalization which will filter and deliver content geared to the specific user but in most cases will not provide real time customer interaction. Interaction may be delivered in the following methods 

For additional detail on collaboration services please refer to the Collaboration Delivery Vehicle in DAF found above.

The message digest may include a log of times when modifications to the data occurred. The authentication information may also include a digital signature. In addition the authentication information may further include a certification. Further the certification may include a user identifier a service identifier a public key which is used to verify the digital signature a name of an issuer of the certification a period which the certification is valid and an email address.

In the last few years computer crimes have exploded hackers have defaced the web site of the CIA stolen information and software from NASA and the Pentagon and made unauthorized wire transfers causing banks to lose millions. According to WarRoom Research financial losses from computer crime run at 10 billion a year. Historically 80 of security problems have been internal ones either from employees exceeding their level of authorization or ones that are disgruntled. Netcentric computing and eCommerce are increasing the risks due to rapidly evolving technology infrastructures. As access to corporate systems is extended virtually and new security holes are discovered daily security issues become complex.

eCommerce while providing immense potential business advantages may also expose businesses to significant risks. If their systems are broken into they are at risk to financial loss embarrassment lost customers and potential legal liability. Businesses often hesitate to take advantage of eCommerce because they fear security problems. Although security technologies are continually evolving to mitigate these eCommerce security risks security breeches occur because businesses fail to implement an appropriate mixture of security solutions.

The problems associated with connecting the network to the vast Internet are widely published. Hackers abound and new methods for compromising networks are published almost daily. However what about connecting the network to a partner for project collaboration or perhaps a supplier for automatic inventory control One might trust their supplier however does one really know how well their network is secured Contracts and Service Levels can and should deal with many of these issues however technology can also be used to enforce security policies.

Once the correct mixture of security solutions has been implemented the company will experience many benefits besides peace of mind that their site is secure. Security also allows people to conduct business functions over the Internet which previously could only be done in person or with a more private connection. This allows expansion into new markets and new business capabilities increases efficiency and reduces the cost of doing business. For example in the typical electronic storefront scenario security is enabling an unknown buyer and seller to exchange goods with a reasonable assurance that the transaction will be honored on both ends. Security can also be a selling point for a company s eCommerce services. By demonstrating an increased level of trust and reduced exposure to fraud a customer may choose one merchant s services over another s. Furthermore eCommerce technologies rely on electronic automated security rather than imprecise procedural security. This can result in more reliable processing and fewer errors.

Unless customers and users feel the system is secure and there is little to no risk involved with using the system the implementation will not be successful. Depending on the system the amount of security in the different security areas will vary. By securing all aspects of the site it will make it extremely difficult for an intruder to work their way into the system without being detected. There are a number of different approaches which can be employed to provide system security. Among the most common are firewalling encryption and authentication. Each provides a particular type and degree of security and in many instances it makes sense to use multiple technologies together to achieve the desired result. Security must be built into a system extremely carefully in order to be effective.

The details of security in eCommerce will be discussed in terms of five eCommerce cross component application types. The five application types discussed are 

Visa and MasterCard have jointly developed the Secure Electronic Transaction SET protocol to allow secure cost effective bank card transactions over open networks. SET includes facilities for 

Consumers get their encryption keys using a specific program integrated into their browser. This program automatically converts a consumer s credit card number into a certificate given by Visa or MasterCard. This certificate contains a key and will be attached permanently to the browser of the consumer.

Then for every transaction the consumer asks the merchant to send his certificate and the merchant can ask the consumer s bank for authentication with the customer s certificate.

Full implementation of SET requires certificates be issued for each credit card a consumer wishes to use on the Internet. This raises enormous administrative challenges as well as the problems involved in achieving this level of universal adoption.

There are different technical approaches for Internet security. The end goal of the security technologies is the same. It is important to pay attention to the approach and questions that they try to answer. For example Secure Socket Layer SSL and Secure HTTP SHTTP have been viewed as competing technology. SSL uses the TCPI IP protocol to provide transaction security at the transport level. Security properties are linked to the channel of communication between the two parties. The issue they are addressing is channel privacy for a conversation or transaction. SHTTP provides transaction security at the document level. Each document is designated as private by the sender. This approach is addressing the question of authentication and authorization of web transactions.

The first area to secure is data. It has to be ensured information is protected from unauthorized access. This is mostly important when sensitive data such as credit card numbers or business figures are transmitted. Data usually passes a long way before reaching its final destination and can easily be read by a third party. Data therefore has to be encrypted before transmission. Today several encryption techniques are used which ensure the data is unusable if intercepted.

In addition to encrypting the data the parties involved in an electronic transaction need to know that the data received or sent is secure. Authentication techniques require the identities of the sender and receiver are known and the information sent arrives unaltered. Authentication can be accomplished with both the use of a message digest and a digital signature. Details on some of these techniques are discussed below.

Cryptography is an essential component in securing data. In the most basic sense cryptography is encrypting and decrypting data using an algorithm s or key of some sort. Encrypted data is useless without the key to decrypt it. Today several encryption standards exist utilizing a wide variety of algorithms and keys. Details on some of the different methods can be found in the

A message digest is used to make sure no one has altered the message between transmission and reception. It is used to provide data integrity. A digest is associated with a sent message. The recipient can re compute the digest and compare the new one with the sent one. If they match the message has not been tampered during transmission. The algorithm used to compute digest must be the same for the sender and the recipient. A message digest is a short fixed length digital code derived in a one way fashion from a longer variable length message. As a result it is impossible to determine the original message on the basis of the digest or to find a different message with the same digest.

Digital signatures ensure the message recipient only the sender of the message could have sent it. The sender signs a message by encrypting a digest of the message with their private key. No one but the particular sender could have generated the digest corresponding to the message. This provides authentication of the sender as well as non repudiation of the origin. Encrypting a message digest also links the signature with the message content. The sender can t claim they did not send the message or the message is not the one they sent.

Some security techniques may require the use of a public key for encrypting data. When using a public keys issues may arise with key management and verification. Often a trusted third party will be needed to issue a Certification Authority CA for keys and signatures. Certification Authority declares which public key and signatures belongs to which users and services. Because a user needs the CA public key to check validity of certificates CA must provide a way to safely deliver its own public key.

The client environment should also be secured. Since systems may be open to public use and accessible to a large audience it could be subject to new types of attacks. An environment must have security mechanisms in place to control who can access it as well as controls on the actions these users may perform. This may be achieved using authorization models. Authorization models are used to determine which entities for example people or applications can access specific applications data or resources.

With the onset on Netcentric computing entire applications or other forms of executable content may be downloaded across a network. This style of computing introduces a variety of security concerns. Downloads may come in the form of applications applets ActiveX controls scripts and a variety of other software. It is important to understand the different security concerns with the downloads.

Java is designed for developing programs to run on many different kinds of computers connected together in a network. A Java Applet is a special kind of Java program attached to a Web page. Applets are embedded into a Web page s HTML definition and interpreted by Java enabled browser. It is possible to have users download the applet from the Web and run the program locally.

Running some unknown person s untrusted code is also inherently dangerous. For this reason Java restricts the behavior of Applets to a set of safe actions Safe applets are labeled as trusted applets . The Java security model restricts an Applet as follows 

Because of its built in security model lava addresses these risks head on. Unfortunately there are still holes in lava s security model which allow some risks. For example applets could be created to perform various harmful acts 

ActiveX is a technology developed by the Microsoft Corporation for distributing software over the Internet. Like lava Applets an ActiveX control can be embedded in a Web page where it typically appears as a smart interactive graphic. Unlike Java which is a platform independent programming language ActiveX controls are distributed as executable binaries and must be separately compiled for each target machine and operating system.

The ActiveX security model is considerably different from Java Applets. ActiveX places no restrictions on what a control can do. Instead each ActiveX control can be digitally signed by its author in such a way that the signature cannot be altered or repudiated. The digital signatures can then be certified by a trusted certifying authority such as VeriSign to create the equivalent of a shrink wrapped software package. If downloading a signed ActiveX control causes a machine to crash the responsible party will be identifiable.

This security model places the responsibility for the computer system s security on the user. Before the browser downloads an ActiveX control that has not been signed at all or has been signed but certified by an unknown certifying authority the browser presents a dialog box warning the user this action may not be safe. The user can abort the transfer or may continue the transfer and take his chances.

Internet scripting languages are programming languages embedded in HTML pages and are interpreted by the user s browser for example Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer . Typically they are dedicated to control the user s interaction with an HTML document for example when 

As scripts are pieces of code from a foreign source executed on the user system they raise security issues. Indeed a user must be sure a downloaded script will not perform malicious actions against his system. Scripting languages designers have to manage the balance between security achieved through restriction and language capabilities.

Securing the server environment will depend upon the technology and architecture of the implementation. Techniques and security models exist for the different methods of server side computing. Included below is basic security information for some of the different technologies.

A firewall is used to protect a trusted network from an untrusted network. Typically the two networks in question are an organization s internal network trusted and the Internet untrusted . A firewall is a system or group of systems that enforces an access control policy between two networks. A firewall is a collection of components or a system placed between two networks and possesses the following properties 

Common Gateway Interface CGI scripts are a way of processing information submitted to the web server using a form. A CGI script can be written in any language able to use standard IN and OUT streams usually Perl or C shell . To process a form the client first submits the information content to the server. On the server a CGI script reads the form contents then uses it to write a new HTML page which is sent back from the server to the client. Security problems with CGI scripts occur on both the client and the server sides.

Submitting a form to a CGI script which is located on a server implies the sending of the contents of this form over the Network. If the channel used is not safe form content can easily be read and perverted. Any way of securing the channel such as SSL PCT or S HTTP can be used to achieve confidentiality of submitted information. As these protocols must be implemented by both client and server a user must check the server is able to secure the channel. Current popular browsers are able to warn the user if information is being submitted in an unsafe fashion.

Processing a form on the server using server resources such as system commands can lead to security holes. Indeed forms can be full of malicious content causing the server to perform confidential information delivery server crashes or unauthorized accesses.

The only way to protect a server from attacks through CGI script is to be very careful when writing testing and using CGI scripts. As far as possible CGI scripts should avoid executing system commands. Each submitting entry should be checked and analyzed before being processed. Script sources must be hidden as analyzing the source of a script is the best way to find an efficient attack through it. On multiple user systems the right to install CGI scripts should only be granted to the administrator or trustworthy users.

The Common Object Request Broker architecture is an open distributed object computing infrastructure standardized by the Object Management Group. CORBA specifies the interfaces structures and policies used by distributed objects components to communicate independently of the language operating systems machine or network.

The CORBA 2.0 specification presents a good set of security policies which provide authentication data integrity confidentiality and non repudiation.

The standard leaves to the applications the problem of handling the non repudiation policies without conforming to the ISO specifications. The standard does not thoroughly solve the problem of interoperability between different security domains.

The Microsoft Component Object Model COM provides a model based on Object Technology to manage inter process communication on a local computer. Microsoft s Distributed Component Object Model is an extension of COM supporting the distribution of collaborative processes over a network.

The Remote Method Invocation allows a programmer to create distributed Java to lava applications. This allows remote lava objects to be invoked from other Java virtual machines even those on different hosts. A Java program can call a remote object only when it has obtained a reference to that remote object. This can be done by 

A client can call a remote object on a server and that server can also act as a client when calling other remote objects. As RMI both implies execution of foreign code and communication over a network deploying RMI requires a secured environment and secured communication.

The RMI specification does not define any security features for distributed transactions. In order to secure the transfer of information between hosts located in different address spaces some security features need to be added to the specification.

In the sample architecture shown in a potential customer will access a corporate web site for some sales information. This is an information source only no transactions exchanges of value can be performed. Internet users will surf to the advertising site and click on various links within the page to get more information on particular products. The web server can make requests from the application server to serve dynamic pages to the user. The application server can pull information from the database if detailed product information is requested. Site administrators develop content on the development server and test it on the staging server.

An exemplary security architecture is illustrated in . This architecture is superior to the architecture of .

In the sample architecture shown in a silicon chip designer wishes to have direct network access to several of their customers in order to share specifications distribute engineering designs and collaborate on works in progress. Corporate employees from headquarters local offices or from a remote location can access information stored on the web server or the back end database server. Employees also have the ability to access the simulation application which is web enabled. Customers may access design information that is posted on the web server but cannot access back end systems. The customer may also post information on their own web server or database server to provide detailed specifications or information to the chip manufacturer.

In the sample architecture shown in customers of a software vendor are able to access the vendor s web site and attempt to solve their technical problems without directly burdening the vendor customer support personnel. If an answer is not found the customer can send an email to the support organization which can be responded to by a support representative. This architecture serves three different applications 1 a customer client application which produces a web interface for accessing personalized and product specific online help resources including email chat rooms news groups and full text searches 2 a customer support representative application which can be used to respond to a client user s request via email chat or news and 3 an administration application which enables the corporate web master to easily change the look and feel of the support site for a company.

An exemplary security architecture is illustrated in . This architecture provides more security than the architecture of .

Upon arrival of the request at the web server VB Scripts or JScripts are run as requested in the Active Server Pages. These scripts interact with OLE COM objects which reside on the application server. These objects run application services to handle the information requested by the user. The application services are in turn handled by transaction services which control object operations and data transactions on local and remote databases. The answer to the request is then sent back to the client where it is translated from ASP to HTML or handled by ActiveX.

In the sample architecture illustrated in all visitors will be provided access to a retail venue selling a variety of goods encompassing many merchants. Users will see a different default store depending on their particular interests and corresponding profiles. The customer is able to view all products in an encapsulated format where limited product information is shown. When a product is selected descriptions pricing incentives and other details can be shown. The customer can place items in a shopping basket as well as viewing and deleting items already in the basket. To purchase all the items in a basket the users shipping and billing information credit card information and an email address.

In a sample transaction the customer will dial into their ISP and surf to the shopping mall site. The web server will then request a cookie from the user s web browser to determine if they have used the service before and if they have a personalization profile. If the user has a cookie the web server will request the personalization profile from the application server and present it to the user. The user then can browse through the site selecting different objects from each merchant s page and placing those objects in a shopping cart. The shopping cart is maintained at the application server. If the user decides to purchase the items in the shopping cart he will click the Buy Now button and will be prompted for shipping and payment information. This information is gathered by the web server and sent back to the application server. The application server then routes it to the payment services function at the bottom of the picture. Payment services will validate the credit card and send back a positive or negative response. Once the payment has been approved an entry is made in a payment file for each merchant whose goods were purchased. This payment file is transferred hourly to each merchant for order processing.

The information about the customer may be analyzed to identify a frequency and magnitude of purchases made by the customer. The decision support service may be designed to manage advertisements included with the e Commerce application.

As an option the decision support service may be designed to manage promotions included with the e Commerce application. As an additional option the information may also include demographics of the customer. Further reporting tools may also be provided for reporting unfulfilled merchandise sales tax goods sold back order items sales forecasting and activity on the e Commerce application.

An optimized eCommerce implementation will allow the integration of eCommerce related data to be used by a company s decision support system shown in . ECommerce applications will generate an enormous amount of data about customer spending habits and other customer information. To leverage this information to its fullest extent information systems should be integrated to allow the manipulation and evaluation of this data by the appropriate user groups.

The decision support services for an eCommerce solution are consistent with any other implementation. Listed below are some specific decision support services to consider in the context of an eCommerce application.

Services can be designed for capturing analyzing and storing customer behaviors. The information gathered would be very similar to a profiling services described in complex personalization.

Market Data Services are designed to analyze customer data. This data is used to accurately target promotions and advertising to the appropriate user groups. For example marketing may be interested to know the demographics of the people browsing the eCommerce site to more effectively sell advertising.

Site reports may enhance the overall efficiency of the site. Reporting tools and procedures should be put in place to at least cover the basic site needs. Some basic reporting needs may include transaction report unfulfilled merchandise sales tax goods sold back order items sales forecasting and site activity.

Custom HTML tags may be provided for enhancing a presentation of the e Commerce component. Also templates and or wizards may be provided for creating e Commerce applications and or interfaces. Preferably an integration of the e Commerce component with data of the framework of the enterprise is performed.

Ideally a business s eCommerce strategy should integrate into the business s enterprise strategy. Following the same logic the eCommerce systems should also be integrated into the enterprise s architecture and systems. In most cases eCommerce implementations are a separate entity added in a furious haste with little consideration of integration with the enterprise. As a result numerous integration patches need to be implemented to synch data such as order customer and product with the enterprise. Furthermore this will result in additional maintenance as the enterprise strategy and eCommerce evolve. If the eCommerce strategy requires an immediate presence a concurrent effort should be made to understand how the eCommerce systems should be integrated into the enterprise s overall strategy.

Ideally the eCommerce strategy should be implemented as an enterprise system integrated with the existing enterprise architecture capabilities and data. If the eCommerce system needs additional capabilities these should be assessed and potentially added as enterprise capabilities. For example if the enterprise does not support complex personalization these capabilities should be introduced as an enterprise capability rather than just an eCommerce capability. Other enterprise applications could utilize these capabilities in the future.

In many cases the eCommerce implementation will span multiple enterprises. Implementing a buyer centric or trading partner type solution will involve multiple enterprises. In these cases the integration aspect will often prove to be the key factor to the success of the implementation. Some of the key hurdles for a multi enterprise system are 

An eCommerce system can be added as a package or one component at a time. Here are some key considerations concerning package integration.

How much of the commerce capabilities does it provide For example in merchandising and transaction processing how different are the commerce capabilities offered from those desired Does it provide open API s 

The commerce package itself may need to integrate components such as payment systems tax software or other components. Research on what options can be integrated may be important. Some packages may not be compatible with any other components and require use of their proprietary components.

Some packages will provide custom HTML tags in order to enhance the presentation. Utilization of these tags may result in a less open and more proprietary system. Be sure to understand the impacts using these tags may have Will they work with all browsers How will these be changed in future release .

Many of the eCommerce packages provide templates and wizards to create some of the basic eCommerce applications and interfaces. The templates and wizards may reduce some development time by providing this base. They should only be considered a starting point for the development of robust eCommerce applications. In most cases creating an interface to the implementation s specific needs will require considerable additional customization.

The following portion of the specification discusses a bandwidth market according to an embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is particularly applicable to the demand and supply planning aspect of the eCommerce Market Space. In the discussion the bandwidth provider is the manufacturer as set forth above while the bandwidth distributor is the service provider as set forth above.

Four important trends seem to dominate the future of data networking. First customers will have a growing number of options when selecting a network vendor and technology. New higher bandwidth network technologies are being introduced to take advantage of existing carrier infrastructures. Second as vendors continue to build out their network infrastructure bandwidth is becoming increasingly available and at lower costs. As more bandwidth becomes available competition among vendors to capture market share will result in dramatically lower prices. This increase in competition among network vendors will undoubtedly change the market significantly. Third vendors will start to shift to usage based pricing structures. As competition increases they will not be able to continue to reap profits from flat rate pricing schemes. Fourth the popularity of the Internet is driving a trend in internetworking. As the technology moves forward more and more networks will be joined to one another resulting in seamless transport between networks.

One objective of the instant bandwidth market is to provide a more efficient mechanism for buying and selling network bandwidth. By providing a market in which distributors can trade bandwidth the fundamental forces of supply and demand drive the appropriate prices for the bandwidth providers services.

Without a bandwidth market if a customer subscribes to a distributor who offers a service that typically requires lower data rates such as Internet access the distributor may not have purchased enough bandwidth for other more bandwidth intensive applications. If a customer decides that they want to use a bandwidth provider for higher bandwidth or more demanding QoS applications such as video conferencing their distributor may not be able to provide high enough access rates or guaranteed service levels within the customer s Location Area Code LAC . Without knowing all possible services that its customers may use a distributor is unable to purchase appropriate bandwidth and service levels to satisfy all requests.

In a similar situation if a consumer in a first location wants to make a video call to someone in a second location and pay for the call unless their Distributed Virtual Network Service DVNS has purchased bandwidth in the LAC of the second location a bandwidth provider can not complete the call. This limitation has serious implications. First many applications can not to traverse DVNS boundaries forcing a customer to only communicate with others who share their same distributor. Second as most distributors are probably be focused on offering a single service e.g. DSS TV or Internet access their customers can not access other services on a bandwidth provider s network. The bandwidth provider can become a network dedicated to singular functions. People who wish to access multiple services may need to subscribe to more than one distributor and may require additional Customer Premise Equipment CPE .

In order to allow customers to access any location or service on bandwidth providers networks it is necessary for distributors to be able to buy and sell bandwidth. If a customer wants to make a video call to a location in which its distributor does not have bandwidth the DVNS should be able to purchase bandwidth from another distributor who has excess capacity. Ideally this could be done on a real time basis so that customers can immediately access the location or service. Not only does this provide a mechanism for customers to cross DVNS geographic and service boundaries but it also provides a way for distributors to sell off their excess bandwidth. As distributors can now sell off unused bandwidth in a secondary market they are more likely to purchase additional wholesale capacity. Like other commodities bandwidth could be traded among distributors ultimately resulting in an efficient market.

In addition to reducing risk for distributors a bandwidth provider could also use the market to post excess wholesale capacity.

Another major benefit of a bandwidth market is its ability to efficiently price bandwidth. As distributors buy and sell capacity the price of the bandwidth moves towards a market equilibrium where supply hits demand.

As bandwidth is traded by service level guarantees and LAC this eliminates some of the complex analysis that distributors need to perform in order to determine fair market prices. In addition by analyzing sales in the bandwidth market a bandwidth provider is able to accurately gauge demand and price bandwidth in each location. Taken a step further a bandwidth provider could post all of its bandwidth on a wholesale market instead of negotiating directly with each distributor. Distributors could then bid for this bandwidth resulting in efficient wholesale pricing in which the bandwidth provider maximizes its revenues.

A market for trading bandwidth virtually eliminates the difficult pricing problems faced by a bandwidth provider s marketing department. In addition distributors have the ability to sell off excess bandwidth reducing their risk significantly. To further reduce risk a futures market could be established allowing distributors to hedge bandwidth purchases. This would allow distributors who are mainly interested in selling value added service to their customers to avoid fluctuations in bandwidth prices.

The ability of a DVNS to purchase another distributor s bandwidth has an additional impact for roaming which is sometimes referred to as nomadicity. One of the goals of a bandwidth provider may be to allow a customer to take their Subscriber Identifier Module or SIM card and plug it into another CPE when they are on the road. This would allow a business traveler to plug his or her SIM card into a hotel s CPE to access the bandwidth provider s network. However if the hotel CPE does not have enough bandwidth available to support the business traveler s application its DVNS could purchase the extra capacity on the bandwidth market.

Without the instant bandwidth market distributors have to negotiate independent contracts with each DVNS that manages CPEs with content that their customers access. This may require hundreds of bilateral agreements among distributors. As these bilateral agreements may be difficult and costly to negotiate many distributors would not allow their customers to access certain services unless their is enough critical mass to warrant a contract.

In addition distributors would have to negotiate with other distributors every time that they want to resell their excess capacity. This too could result in hundreds of bilateral agreements and could be costly to negotiate and administer. Dispute resolution could also present a major problem.

With the bandwidth market distributors can avoid costly bilateral agreements. The market provides an efficient means of trading bandwidth among distributors. As distributors would enter into a contract with the market they do not have to negotiate with each DVNS that they ultimately trade with. The bandwidth market also serves as an equalizer giving small distributors the same ability to purchase bandwidth as larger providers. By allowing a smaller DVNS to purchase bandwidth it could provide its customers with the same access as larger distributors. A bandwidth provider could benefit by selling wholesale capacity on the bandwidth market avoiding periodic negotiations with hundreds of distributors.

Another benefit of the bandwidth market is its handling of contracts. To allow the market to operate efficiently bandwidth could be packaged and traded as contracts. In order to package bandwidth it may be necessary for the bandwidth market to define products. These products are based on a combination of bandwidth or cell counts location service level guarantees time of day duration and other factors. Although establishing these structures is a complex task it is much easier for the bandwidth market to go through the steps of defining these packages once rather than distributors worrying about them every time that they negotiate with other providers. This simplifies the sales process dramatically.

Once a contract has been purchased the DVNS issues a Contract ID to its customer s CPE during call setup. In addition to defining bandwidth service level guarantees and duration the contract also determines who pays for the call e.g. calling party pays collect call etc. . As the contract is purchased at an agreed upon price this price provides rating information that can be used for billing purposes. When the contract is executed the CPE reports usage data back to the DVNS. This usage data includes the Contract ID allowing the DVNS or a settlements process to correlate the call back to the original transaction. As the contract is recorded at the time of the transaction this information could be forwarded to the distributors the bandwidth provider and a clearinghouse for processing. This simplifies the revenue allocation process by providing clear information for rating billing and settling the call.

One advantage of having call setup based on contracts is that the CPE is given a well defined call duration and total cell or bit count. As the DVNS steps out of the picture after call setup the CPE is responsible for making sure that it does not exceed these agreed upon thresholds. If the CPE reaches the maximum duration or cell count it automatically terminates the call. While ATM does require the CPE to shape its traffic to conform with the Peak and Sustainable Cell Rates and the transfer capabilities agreed upon during call setup it does not define the call duration or maximum traffic transfer. The bandwidth contract does a nice job in filling this gap and is ideal for supporting pre paid calling structures e.g. credit or debit card .

Another benefit of the bandwidth contract is that it specifies agreed upon service levels for call setup. After the call has been completed usage data can be analyzed to see if these service levels have been met. This allows a bandwidth provider and its distributors to provide customers with Service Level Agreements that may have penalty clauses for violations.

Even if a bandwidth provider is not willing to develop and operate a bandwidth market for buying and selling its services it is very possible that a third party may fill the gap. If a bandwidth provider is unable to accurately price bandwidth inefficiencies in pricing bandwidth result in arbitrage opportunities. Like airline ticket aggregators speculative distributors could start buying up under priced bandwidth and selling it to other distributors. These transactions are initially handled by bilateral agreements. As transaction volumes increase distributors start to form groups of trading partners. Applications are developed to streamline the process of trading bandwidth. Eventually a bandwidth market for a bandwidth provider s services will evolve out of these alliances.

If a bandwidth provider decides not to develop the bandwidth market the alternative market that develops may have some negative aspects. First the larger the number of bilateral trading agreements the greater the likelihood for error. If two distributors misunderstand one another it is possible that each DVNS may assign the same bandwidth allocation to different customers. This could result in an oversubscription of services.

Second trading alliances may exclude smaller or less political DVNSs ending up with an Old Boys Network of distributors dominating the market. This could result in a small oligopoly dictating bandwidth pricing potentially forcing other distributors out of business. As one would expect losing control of pricing for a bandwidth provider s services could have dangerous consequences.

Rather than let another organization establish a market for trading bandwidth a bandwidth provider could develop the bandwidth market itself. In addition to keeping control of bandwidth pricing the bandwidth provider could earn additional revenue by charging trading transaction fees. When coupled with clearing functions this market could prove an important selling point for attracting distributors. By offering a simple and controlled mechanism for reselling excess bandwidth the bandwidth provider reduces the risk faced by distributors of purchasing too much bandwidth. A distributor may be more likely to offer the bandwidth provider s services if they know that a bandwidth market is available to buy and sell excess capacity and it is managed and operated by the wholesale provider.

The most efficient way to trade bandwidth is to have one market for all participants. However in order to encourage Charter Customers bandwidth providers may need to offer special rate structures and benefits to potential distributors. Once the bandwidth market is established many of the benefits such as bandwidth contracts and CPE traffic shaping will be useful even for distributors who have large discount structures. Rather than create custom purchasing mechanisms for these customers they could use the same processes and applications that the market uses for buying and selling bandwidth even if they are dealing exclusively with only one bandwidth provider. Because of the standardized process for selling bandwidth a bandwidth provider can avoid having to develop custom interfaces for each of its large distributors.

There may still be a need for the establishment of bilateral agreements between a bandwidth provider and its Charter Customers. In addition many distributors who specialize in the same value added services but in different regions may want to establish private trading blocks. For example as video conferencing providers have similar bandwidth needs they may want to establish a closed market for trading among themselves. This would allow them to focus on similar type bandwidth contracts in different regions of the world and is somewhat analogous to cellular roaming agreements.

For these reasons the bandwidth market may be segmented into multiple trading floors or markets. As shown in the top level segment would be a Pre Sold bandwidth market . This would be the vehicle that a bandwidth provider could use to privately sell long term contracts to larger distributors. Bandwidth sales in this market can be pre negotiated between the bandwidth provider and the distributor. The market would be used to record and track these transactions.

The next segment would be the Open Market Bandwidth Sales . This market would be used by distributors to post the excess bandwidth that they wish to sell. In addition any bandwidth that a bandwidth provider has not sold under pre negotiated agreements could be posted to this market. As this market segment is open to all of the distributors it should be an efficient market in which pricing is established at the point where supply hits demand.

In operation an amount of unused bandwidth of a first user is identified. illustrates a method of automatically identifying the first user s unused bandwidth. In this example unused bandwidth is identified by monitoring bandwidth use of the first user to determine an amount of bandwidth used by the first user in operation . In operation the amount of bandwidth used by the first user is compared to the total amount of bandwidth the first user has been allocated. The amount of unused bandwidth is determined in operation by subtracting the amount of bandwidth used by the first user from the total amount of bandwidth allocated to the first user.

The first user would then be notified of the amount of unused bandwidth in operation and sent a request in operation asking whether the first user would like to sell or trade the unused bandwidth.

Referring again to a request for bandwidth on the network is received from a second user in operation . The request may be received before or after the amount of unused bandwidth is identified in operation above. The request may be directly received from the second user or an agent of the second user. Alternatively the second user or all of the users may be notified of the amount of unused bandwidth available. The second user may be notified in any of a multitude of ways. For example a listing of available unused bandwidth that is for sale or trade by any number of users may be compiled and displayed or sent to some or all of the users of bandwidth. The listing could be complex or as simple as a listing on a web site with the price and name and contact information of the first user. Once the user is notified a response from the second user as to the amount of unused bandwidth the second user would like to purchase or trade for would be awaited and received.

In operation the unused bandwidth of the first user is reallocated to the second user. In other words the second user is given control of the unused bandwidth to use reserve or trade or sell. The bandwidth provider may be contacted and told to reallocate the bandwidth by terminating the first user s access to the unused bandwidth and giving the second user access to the bandwidth. Alternatively access codes that would have been used by the first user to access predetermined amounts of bandwidth corresponding to the unused bandwidth being reallocated may be turned over to the second user to permit the second user to access the bandwidth.

In one embodiment of the present invention the unused bandwidth that is reallocated to the second user in operation of is done so in exchange for money paid by the second user to the first user. In a method of exchanging money for bandwidth is illustrated. In operation notification of an agreement to sell bandwidth for an amount of money is received. Information concerning the manner of payment is received in operation . This information includes how the second user is going to pay for the bandwidth. For example access information of a bank account or of a credit line could be received from the second user which would be used to perform an electronic transaction of money from the second user s account to the first user. In operation the transfer of money is verified such as by receiving an electronic receipt from the bank of the first user which acknowledges a deposit of the money. In operation the unused bandwidth of the first user is reallocated to the second user.

Further a transaction fee may be charged for reallocating the unused bandwidth. The transaction fee may be a percentage of the total value of the bandwidth traded or sold a flat fee charged per transaction or a flat fee charged per unit of bandwidth.

In another embodiment of the present invention the unused bandwidth of the first user is packaged with unused bandwidth of another user and reallocated to the second user under the terms of a contract as discussed above in the Establish Bandwidth Contracts section hereinabove. This would allow a second user who requires more unused bandwidth than the first user has available to satisfy the second user s requirements.

Looking again to the remaining segments at the lowest level are the Closed Markets . These markets would be established to allow vendors who offer similar services e.g. DSS TV ISPs etc. to trade among themselves. In some instances a bandwidth provider may be given the right to post excess bandwidth that fits predefined contract profiles to some of these markets. The bandwidth market could be modeled on either an auction concept or as commodities markets.

All transactions in the foregoing markets can result in a bandwidth contract. These contracts provide an effective mechanism for tracking bandwidth sales and are very useful during the rating and settlements processes.

In an exemplary model a bandwidth provider requires distributors to purchase wholesale Priority 1 and 2 traffic at least 24 hours before the time that it is needed. This means that distributors may be forced to estimate their bandwidth requirements for the following day. As the Internet outage during the last US presidential elections suggests bandwidth demand may fluctuate significantly for a number of external reasons. In certain instances it may not be possible to the distributors to predict demand. While the bandwidth market may provide a good mechanism for determining price when the next day s demand is known it does not help in situations of great uncertainty.

In addition to causing problems for distributors in tracking and estimating customer demand the 24 hour advanced bandwidth model could be problematic for the bandwidth provider. Just as distributors may not be able to predict the next day s demand the bandwidth provider may not be able to determine the optimal price of the bandwidth. While a static bandwidth market based on contracts negotiated 24 hours in advance of their actual execution may certainly help determine pricing the 24 hour requirement may result in some inefficiencies. On a similar note although the bandwidth market reduces risk by providing a mechanism for reselling excess capacity the 24 hour rule results in a one day liability to distributors.

Another problem with the 24 hour requirement is that it does not allow a customer to transparently access irregular services or locations. If a customer decides that they want to call an unusual location or access a service that has not been pre negotiated by their DVNS they may have to call up their distributor to have them acquire the appropriate service for the next day. A customer in the United States may not be willing to contact its service provider 24 hours in advance to setup a video conference call to someone in Botswana.

What is needed to solve these problems is the capability to purchase bandwidth in real time. By giving the distributor the ability to buy and sell bandwidth in real time an efficient market can be created in which revenues are maximized. The value of the bandwidth is allowed to float based on supply and demand. This would also be much more efficient than a static market where the price is set or buyers are allowed to bid over time with the highest bid taking the bandwidth because the bandwidth could be purchased immediately and perhaps below the price that would otherwise be asked for the bandwidth in a static market. The mechanics for negotiating real time bandwidth contracts is outlined hereinafter.

While a real time bandwidth market is very desirable it does not negate the benefits of a static bandwidth market. Although a static bandwidth market does not result in the same pricing efficiencies that can be realized in a real time market it still offers benefits to the bandwidth provider and its distributors. As the market provides a mechanism to buy and sell excess bandwidth distributors may be more apt to commit to large long term commitments. In addition although customers may need to call a day in advance to access a service or location this is better the not having access. Distributors are also relieved of the burden of having to negotiate hundreds of bilateral agreements. As discussed below the bandwidth contracts that are traded in the market are very useful for rating and settlements processing.

In order to support a real time bandwidth market it may be necessary to include contract negotiation in the call setup process. illustrates a contract negotiation process. In operation bandwidth on a network is allocated i.e. sold or traded in allotments among a plurality of users. In operation an amount of unused bandwidth of a first user is identified. A request for bandwidth on the network is received from a second user in operation . It should be noted that operations may be accomplished by any means including those specified hereinabove with respect to operations of .

Then a negotiation between the first and second users is allowed in operation to determine transaction terms for reallocation of the unused bandwidth from the first user to the second user. In its simplest form one embodiment of the present invention would simply receive pricing information from one user and send it to the other user and vice versa over and over until each user is satisfied with the terms for the transaction. Upon acceptance of the transaction terms by the first and second users contract information relating to the transaction terms is sent to the first and second users in operation . Optionally the terms may set forth in a contract format which the first and second users may agree to form a contract. Alternatively acceptance of the terms of the transaction may be an acceptance of a contract including the terms of the transaction and the contract information is a recitation of the terms of the contract.

In one embodiment of the present invention the contract information defines the amount of unused bandwidth a duration of use of the unused bandwidth a service level and or a price. Optionally a transaction fee may be charged for allowing the negotiation between the first and second users. Further the step of allowing the negotiation between the first and second users may occur in real time. In another aspect of the present invention the contract information is sent to a third party after the third party requests bandwidth from the second user. Furthermore the contract information may include a contract identifier.

One of the advantages of the present process is that the CPE can use standard call setup signaling assuming that it is similar to the Q.2931 method used by ATM. When a call request arrives at the DVNS the call parameters and bandwidth requirements are assessed. The customer is first validated by the DVNS which also checks to see if they are allowed to request this service. If the request is valid and the DVNS has available resources as a result of other contracts which may be from long term bandwidth purchases made in the Pre Sold bandwidth market the DVNS may complete the call and pass the Contract ID back to the CPE in a User Defined Information Element IE using standard Q.2931 signaling. If the DVNS does not have the appropriate bandwidth available it may temporarily suspend the call setup process and purchase the bandwidth using the process outlined above. Assuming the DVNS successfully purchases the resources it may forward the Contract ID specified by the transaction to the CPE and complete the call setup process. All calls may require a Contract ID to complete. If for some reason the bandwidth is not available the DVNS may reject the call and notify the CPE that resources were not available.

It should be noted that ATM is designed to allow the customer to renegotiate call parameters such as Peak Cell Rate and Sustainable Cell Rate even after the call is established. If a bandwidth provider plans to fully support ATM a different contract may be required to satisfy an upgrade request. This may require that the DVNS has the ability to renegotiate in the middle of a call. As the call may have two or more Contract IDs the DVNS could close out an EDR record and treat the remainder of the connection as a new call assigning a new EDR.

In evaluating the real time purchasing of bandwidth during call establishment one pertinent area is the time required to complete a transaction. As many protocols such as ATM have timeout values for call setup it may be necessary to stay within these specifications. These timeout values are typically high to accommodate network congestion. In addition some of these values can be tuned by vendor equipment.

One of the advantages of the bandwidth market and bandwidth contracts is the ability to control CPE usage patterns. As a DVNS may need to assign a contract to complete all call setups information in this contract can be passed to the CPE. Based on a variety of factors such as the customer s credit limit the CPE can be instructed to terminate a call when it hits certain thresholds. These thresholds could be based on call duration or cell counts. This may be an excellent mechanism for supporting pre paid billing.

In addition the DVNS may be configured with certain cost thresholds for a particular customer. When establishing an account the customer could instruct the DVNS not to allow video conference calls if the rate is greater than 1.00 a minute. If the DVNS is unable to satisfy a call request within certain pre defined thresholds the CPE may be instructed that the resources are not available possibly notifying the customer the reason that the call could not be setup e.g. rates too high . With little effort this could be extended to allow the customer to configure the information directly into the CPE which in turn would pass it to the DVNS in User Defined Information Elements during call setup.

Another advantage of bandwidth contracts are their ability to support hot billing. By requiring a contract in order to complete a call the DVNS could take advantage of pricing information inherent in the agreement. If the DVNS forwards this pricing information along with the contract to the CPE this would allow the CPE to notify the user on a real time basis how much they have spent during the call. In addition because the rating information accompanies the bandwidth contract the DVNS can calculate the cost of the service and debit the user immediately.

It is important to note that taxation may need to be evaluated if the bandwidth provider supports this model.

In addition to providing markets to buy and sell bandwidth the bandwidth provider may also provide a clearinghouse function. As all usage data may be tagged with a Contract ID the contracts generated in the bandwidth market may be excellent tools for rating calls and determining revenue allocation. These contracts may be forwarded to the rating and settlements engines providing important information needed for each of these processes. Usage data may be correlated to the appropriate contract which may provide rating information service level guarantees and revenue allocation information. This information may be used by the rating and net settlements processing.

As different bandwidth market segments may have different contract structures it may make sense for the clearinghouse function to mimic the bandwidth market structure. Pre Sold Bandwidth of a bandwidth provider could be cleared by a Pre Sold Bandwidth Clearing function. Likewise the Open and Closed markets could have their own clearing functions. Eventually these may feed into one larger clearing process which provides net settlements functions between a bandwidth provider and its distributors.

One of the key functions of the clearinghouse is to offer a mechanism to bill back services between distributors. If a DVNS in Thailand purchases bandwidth from an American distributor in order to complete a video call to the United States the American distributor needs some mechanism for receiving payment from the Thai DVNS. As all distributors must deal with a bandwidth provider at some level it makes sense for the bandwidth provider to provide clearing functions between distributors. The clearing function may allow the US DVNS to bill the Thai DVNS for the bandwidth that it used. The Thai DVNS may then bill its customer for the call. By leveraging a bandwidth provider s fiduciary relationship with each DVNS the bandwidth market when coupled with a clearinghouse function provides a mechanism for one distributor to indirectly bill another distributor s customers.

Then in operation an amount of money the buyer owes the seller for the reallocated bandwidth is determined based on the terms regarding the reallocation of bandwidth. Most often this may be calculated as the price per unit of bandwidth times the number of units of bandwidth being sold and taking into account any penalties and discounts. If amounts of bandwidth of more than one seller are sold together such as under a contract as discussed above the amount of money the buyer owes each seller is calculated. More detail is provided below in the discussion referencing .

Finally in operation the buyer is notified of the amount of money the buyer owes the seller. Notification may be made in a variety of ways. One is through email. Another is via facsimile. Yet another way is an automated voice message sent via telephone. Also a printout with the amount on it i.e. a bill may be sent to the buyer via a delivery service such as the United States Postal Service.

Optionally the present invention may verify that the terms regarding the reallocation of bandwidth have been complied with. This could include verifying the amount of bandwidth that the seller is offering for sale. This could also include verifying that the seller has relinquished control of the bandwidth. Further the buyer s access to the newly purchased bandwidth could be verified.

In one embodiment of the present invention usage data may be received from the buyer and used to determine the amount of money the buyer owes the seller for the reallocated bandwidth. In such an embodiment the buyer could be allowed to purchase bandwidth according to the buyer s requirements. The buyer would then only be liable for the amount of bandwidth actually used plus incidental costs.

The usage data may also be used to determine the cost per unit of bandwidth. Bandwidth used during peak hours is most often more valuable than say bandwidth used in the middle of the night. Thus the usage data could include times of use of the bandwidth as well as the particular amount of bandwidth used during peak hours.

Optionally the usage data may be correlated with corresponding terms via a contract identifier Contract ID as discussed above associated with the usage data. The contract identifier would allow the DVNS or a settlements process to correlate the use of bandwidth back to the original transaction to ensure that the proper party is being billed.

A transaction fee may be charged for performing the determination of the amount of money the buyer owes the seller for the reallocated bandwidth. The transaction fee may be a percentage of the total value of the bandwidth traded or sold or may be a flat fee charged per transaction.

Additionally as the present invention manages both the bandwidth market and Clearinghouse functions it is also the natural choice for arbitrating disputes between distributors.

In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention operations and of are handled by a data processing based apparatus which makes an automated trading market for one or more amounts of bandwidth. The system retrieves the best obtaining bid and asked prices from a remote data base covering the ensemble of institutions or others making a market for the relevant amounts of bandwidth. Data characterizing each bandwidth buy sell order requested by a customer is supplied to the system. The order is qualified for execution by comparing its specific content fields with predetermined stored parameters. The stored parameters include items such as the operative bid and asked current market prices the amount of bandwidth available for customer purchase or sale as appropriate and the maximum acceptable single order size.

As used herein the terms buy and sell refer to customer and distributor purchases and sales. It should be noted that when a customer purchases an amount of bandwidth the market maker sells the amount of bandwidth from its position either reducing a long position increasing a short position or both where the amount of bandwidth sold to the customer exceeds the initial long position. When a customer sells bandwidth the market maker adds bandwidth to its position and or reduces a short position in the bandwidth.

The system may be implemented by any digital data processing equipment per se well known to those skilled in the art e.g. any common bus system interconnecting a digital processor manual data entry terminal apparatus one or more memories one of which contains the controlling program and output signaling apparatus such as a cathode ray tube and printer. The system may be coded in any program language per se well known to those skilled in the art. The process variables may be of any form which conform to the constraints of the particular language being used and the below listed variables are for purposes of illustration only.

The processor communicates over a link with a trader terminal position containing an output signaling device such as a cathode ray tube display and data input apparatus such as a keyboard. Trader terminal has two portions. A terminal position section TI communicates with the processor and a section T is connected by link to a bandwidth market system . The trader terminal communicates its current bid and asked prices for bandwidth s in which it makes a market to bandwidth market via link as do other market makers bridged to link . The terminal portions TI and T may be one integrated smart terminal computer assembly or two separate devices available to the trader at the station .

The processor receives and stores the best highest bid processing variable BSTB BWTH for each amount of bandwidth BWTH in which it makes a market and the best lowest asked price BSTA BWTH from the bandwidth market system via a communications path . The best bid and best asked prices as reported by the bandwidth market form the so called insider market for over the counter amounts of bandwidth. Processor communicates to the bandwidth market system via a link each reportable executed trade for various informational and regulatory purposes. Link may also report trades to the Consolidated Tape Authority CTA and the NASD National Market System NMS for subsequent reporting to the financial industry and general public. Communications path also connects processor with the NASD small order execution system SOES and computer assisted execution system CAES which can participate in relatively small order execution.

Input output network provides data communication with the various branch offices of the brokerage house. Line permits communication with either the branch order entry clerk or directly to the account executives at each branch. While only one branch is shown in it is to be understood that a multiplicity of branches are in data communication with processor . Computer also communicates with third party financial houses via a two way data link e.g. including INSTINET .

To characterize the arrangement in overview the operative best bid best asked inside market prices for each amount of bandwidth in which the system proprietor makes a market are communicated over link from bandwidth market and repose in memory at processor . The market maker has a position in each amount of bandwidth in which he makes a market and the particulars of that position also repose in memory within the composite processor . Orders for trades in the relevant amounts of bandwidth are funneled to the processor in real time as they occur. Orders can be received in several ways. For example and most typically orders may be generated by the brokerage firm s account executives at the branches and communicated to the CPU via the communication path . Orders are also supplied to the processor from third party financial sources e.g. other brokerage firms directly from computer equipped customers banks or the like over communication network . Each of the orders includes appropriate data fields outlined above and more fully discussed below such as an identification of the office and customer or other originator of order bandwidth identification price particulars and so forth.

The processor first determines whether or not each received order can be executed i.e. qualifies the order. There are various reasons why an order may not be executed by the market maker. Thus for example the customer may seek to sell an amount of bandwidth above the current bid price or to purchase the amount of bandwidth below the current asked price. A customer may seek to trade an amount of bandwidth which exceeds the amount which the particular market maker is willing to accommodate either in gross or for any one order. Orders not executable i.e. orders not qualified are either stored in memory in the processor for later execution if they become qualified such as by a favorable change in the market price for an amount of bandwidth which can then accommodate the customer s price limits or are forwarded to other market makers for potential execution over communication links or .

Assuming that an order is executable the processor executes the order appropriately adjusting all balances. Information characterizing the executed order is sent to computer for customers of that brokerage house or reported to the appropriate other institution via links or . The specifics of appropriate transactions may also be reported to the NASD for informational purposes and to the Consolidated Tape Authority and so forth and may become ticker entries.

The bandwidth market system is apprised of the current quotations from all traders making a market in the subject amounts of bandwidth via communication path . The insider market best bid and asked prices are communicated to the market maker s processor via link . When the insider market price changes a variation in the best bid or best asked price the processor in accordance with the instant invention signals the trader at station who is then given the opportunity to readjust his quantity or other market characterizing criteria. Following each price change all non executable orders stored in the processor memory are reviewed to determine whether they have become executable and if so they are in fact executed. Processing then continues as above described to accommodate the real time order inflow.

With the above overview in mind attention is now directed to which is a flow chart of data processing for qualifying for execution an order communicated from a branch order entry clerk or account executive. Proceeding from a start node the data fields comprising this next recorded order is loaded block . The order data fields include the name of the amount of bandwidth BWTH the total amount of bandwidth for the transaction AMT customer identification CUSTID a buy vis a vis sell bit B S the customer s price limit if he wants one or if not a market order designator PR M special instructions if any SP an order number .0.RN and an originator e.g. office account executive or third party institution identification .0.RIGID .

The computer includes a number of stored variables characterizing the market for the bandwidth BWTH which the customer wishes to trade and the market maker s own criteria for his participation in BWTH trading. Thus for example the computer stores the best bid BSTB BWTH the best asked price BSTA BWTH the buy size BSZ BWTH i.e. the total amount of bandwidth BWTH the market maker is willing to sell for customer purchase at the current price the market maker s sell size SSZ BWTH the maximum single order size for bandwidth BWTH which the market maker will accept .0.RSZ BWTH the present amount of bandwidth BWTH long or short in the market maker s position P.0.S BWTH long being positive and short being negative the average cost per unit of bandwidth AVCST BWTH for the bandwidth BWTH long or short in the market maker s portfolio and a running profit total PR BWTH of the market maker in the bandwidth BWTH. Block functioning next determines if order processing is operative in the normal automated market mode for the particular amount of bandwidth BWTH. If not please see below with respect to program flow branches to block to store the order for later retrieval or manual execution. Program flow then returns to start node for retrieval of the next order. Assuming normal automated mode processing YES output of test program flow continues to test to verify the incoming data order to assure correct reception and internal consistency. If an error occurred an error message is produced block and program flow returns to the start node for entry of the incoming next order. In the usual case the order is verified at test and program flow continues to block to determine if the order is a market order or has a limit price test of the PR M variable .

If the order is not a market order but rather is to be executed at or better than a customer specified price N.0. branch from test program flow proceeds to block which distinguishes a customer buy B S B from a sell order B S S . If it is a buy order YES BUY branch from test block determines if the price at which the order is to be executed contents of PR M is greater than or equal to the prevailing asked price BSTA BWTH of the bandwidth. If the purchase price of the order to be executed is greater than the best asked price YES branch of test block determines if the amount of bandwidth AMT in the trade is less than or equal to the amount of bandwidth available for purchase from the market maker i.e. less than the buy size BSZ BWTH . If so YES branch of test the amount of bandwidth AMT in the transaction is compared to the maximum acceptable single order size .0.RSZ BWTH step . Assuming this final criteria is satisfied N.0. exit the order is qualified for execution and program flow continues to block where a variable storing the last position in bandwidth BWTH LP.0.S BWTH is set equal to P.0.S BWTH . The program thereafter proceeds to order execution as detailed in and discussed below.

If the price or buy size tests performed at blocks and fail N.0. branch or if the order size test performed at block indicates the order is too large YES branch the order is not qualified for and will not be executed. When any of these conditions obtain program flow branches to block to store the order for possible later execution if market conditions or market maker criteria change. An appropriate report is generated at block via terminal to characterize non executed order. Thereafter program flow returns to node to process the next received order. The human market system controller receiving the report may of course over ride and complete the trade by hand or manual entry e.g. by authorizing more bandwidth increasing BSZ BWTH if that criterion inhibited order execution.

The foregoing analysis has considered a limit buy order. Returning now to block program flow for a customer sale will next be considered. If the buy sell flag signals a sale program flow branches to block where the PR M limit price is compared to the best bid price PR M.ltoreq.BSTB BWTH . If so YES branch the amount of bandwidth AMT in the order is compared against the available sell size AMT.ltoreq.SSZ BWTH . If there is sufficient bandwidth in the sell size YES branch block determines if the amount of bandwidth AMT is greater than the maximum permissible single order size .0.RSZ BWTH . If the amount of bandwidth AMT does not exceed .0.RSZ BWTH all criteria are satisfied and the sell order will be executed. Processing proceeds to block where the last position intermediate processing variable LP.0.S BWTH is set equal to P.0.S BWTH and order execution proceeds as set forth in . If any price or sell size test performed at blocks or fails program flow branches to block for storage and reporting block .

The above description details order qualification for a limit price transaction. In a trade that is to be executed at market the price tests performed at block for a buy and block for a sale are by passed. Accordingly when block determines that the order is to be executed at market PR M market block is reached and branches the program to size test for a customer sale and test for a customer purchase. The system then operates in the manner above described qualifying the order for execution if the two operative size criteria are satisfied or otherwise storing the order and reporting step .

After the position P.0.S BWTH buy size BSZ BWTH and sell size SSZ BWTH variables have been updated program flow continues to block where messages confirming execution of the trade are furnished to the customer account processor which sends out confirmations of the transaction and otherwise performs the necessary accounting functions for the customer account. The branch clerk or account executive is also notified of order execution via link . The order variables CUSTID SP .0.RN and .0.RIGID are used to appropriately distribute trade reporting proper commission computation and the like. Further the transaction price is typically communicated to the bandwidth market system and the various tape services for reporting. The updated internal market maker variables e.g. SSZ BWTH BSZ BWTH LP.0.S BWTH P.0.S BWTH are stored in memory for use in subsequent order transactions step . Program flow proceeds to block to update the market maker s average per unit of bandwidth inventory cost AVCST BWTH and profit PR BWTH internal management variables for the bandwidth BWTH the data processing for which is described below in conjunction with . After inventory updating and profit accounting data processing exits at node ready to process the next trade.

In the right side of the programming statement of Equation 1 the variable BSTA BWTH AVCST BWTH is the profit or loss margin on the sale representing the difference between the current asked price BSTA BWTH at which the trade occurred and the average cost per unit of bandwidth AVCST BWTH of the bandwidth. When multiplied by the amount of bandwidth previously in the long position LP.0.S BWTH the right factor following the plus sign in the statement of Equation 1 is the profit or loss for the transaction. When added to the previous running profit total PR BWTH the final result stored in PR BWTH is an updated running total of the profit of the market maker in the bandwidth BWTH since the PR BWTH storage array element was last cleared.

Thereafter for the assumed event program flow proceeds to block where the average cost per unit of bandwidth of the new short position in the bandwidth is calculated. In this instance the average cost of the bandwidth is equal to the operative asked price i.e. AVCST BWTH BSTA BWTH . programming then exits at the PROCEED node.

If at block the market maker s present position is long P.0.S BWTH .gtoreq.0 YES program flow continues to test where the buy sell digit determines whether the transaction is a customer purchase or sale. If the trade is a customer sale thus increasing the initially long LPOS BWTH position it is an inventory transaction and program flow branches to block to update the average cost of the BWTH bandwidth position AVCST BWTH AMT BSTB BWTH AVCST BWTH LP.0.S BWTH P.0.S B WTH . Eq. 2.

In the statement of Equation 2 AMT BSTB BWTH is the cost of the bandwidth just purchased from the customer and AVCST BWTH LP.0.S BWTH is the cost of the previous LP.0.S BWTH inventory. Thus by dividing the sum of the new and former purchases by the amount of bandwidth held P.0.S BWTH the new average cost AVCST BWTH is determined.

If at block the transaction was determined to be a customer purchase market maker sale program flow proceeds to block where the market maker s profit is updated PR BWTH PR BWTH AMT BSTA BWTH AVCST BWTH . Eq. 3.

The above processing has reviewed the three possibilities beginning with a long positive market maker bandwidth position entering a transaction as signaled by the contents of LP.0.S BWTH . Comparable functioning obtains if the contents of LP.0.S BWTH in test are negative signaling an initial short position N.0. output of test . Assuming such an initial short position program flow passes to that shown in which is the analog of that shown in .

In brief a test of determines whether the present position P.0.S BWTH is short or long. If the present position is also short P.0.S BWTH 

If at block the transaction is determined a sell block updates the profit total PR BWTH PR BWTH AMT BSTB BWTH AVCST BWTH . Eq. 5.

The average cost per unit of bandwidth of the new P.0.S BWTH short position is the best bid transaction price AVCST BSTB BWTH block . This concludes the profit and cost updating for the transaction.

In most instances more than one institution makes a market in a particular amount of bandwidth. Any market maker may change its bid or asked price at any time transmitting the change to the bandwidth market system via link as above discussed. In such an instance it may be necessary to update the market maker s own prices as where the change affects the insider market best current bid and asked to afford the customer execution at the best prevailing price. is a flow chart illustrating data processing upon receipt of a new market maker quotation from the bandwidth market system . Beginning at an interrupt entry node the system is placed in non automatic execution mode step which prevents automatic execution of any orders in the particular amount of bandwidth BWTH until the market maker has had a chance to respond to the new market prices. If at block it is determined that the best bid BSTB BWTH or best asked BSTA BWTH price has changed program flow proceeds to block where the best bid BSTB BWTH and or best asked price BSTA BWTH are updated to the new values received from bandwidth market.

The system then interactively communicates with the trader terminal in block . A prompt appears on trader TI terminal requesting input regarding possible changes in the maximum acceptable order size .0.RS BWTH the amount of bandwidth available for customer purchase BSZ BWTH and the amount of bandwidth acceptable for customer sales SSZ BWTH . After input of the requested parameters or initializing to default values any orders previously stored in memory are reprocessed block as these orders may now be qualified for execution due to the change in price or other parameters. After stored orders are reviewed and executed if possible data processing is restored to automatic mode block as by simply setting a variable AUT.0. to a predetermined state e.g. AUT.0. and interrupt mode is exited at node . If at block it is determined that the insider market price was not changed by the new market maker quotation program flow branches directly to block to restore automatic mode and exit interrupt mode.

The market making system of the above described invention has thus been shown to automatically accommodate a random real time order flow for bandwidth purchases or sales. Incoming orders are first examined to assure that they satisfy currently operative criteria regarding bandwidth price bandwidth availability and bandwidth order size. Those orders being qualified under the existing criteria are executed and profit and inventory price internal management storage elements are appropriately updated to reflect the several transactions experienced by the system. Orders not qualified for execution are stored and re examined from time to time for possible later executability. The system proceeds automatically without human intervention save to update operative market maker order qualification criteria.

In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention payment of the amount of money that the buyer owes the seller is requested such as through sending the user a bill. Further the amount of money for the reallocated bandwidth can be received from the seller where it will be processed and sent to the seller placed in an account of the seller and or used to pay amounts of money the seller owes to a third party or for the transaction fee.

In an alternate embodiment an operator captures consumer payment directives using a telephone with a small text display. These consumer payment directives are sent to a central computer operated by the system which then uses an automated teller machine network to obtain funds in the amount of the payment from the consumer s automated teller machine accessible bank account. Once the funds are obtained into an account of the system operator the system determines how to pay the biller either by wire transfer debit network using the biller s bank account number or by check and list.

Several exemplary embodiments of the present invention for performing clearing and settlement functions include bill pay or remittance processing systems as set forth below. For brevity and clarity the consumer s account with the biller is referred to herein as the C B consumer biller account thereby distinguishing that account from other accounts the consumer s account with its bank the biller s account with its bank etc. In most cases the biller uses the C B account number to uniquely identify the consumer in its records.

Bill pay transactions however accomplished have several common elements which are either explicit or can be implied by the nature of the transaction. The first is presentment a biller presents the consumer with a bill showing the C B account number and an amount due. The second common element is payment authorization the consumer performs some act e.g. signs a check or other negotiable instrument which authorizes the consumer s bank to transfer funds from the consumer s account to the biller this element might occur after presentment or before as in the case of pre authorized withdrawals and need not be explicit delivery of a check is implicit authorization for the amount of the check . This element is almost always accompanied by some action by the consumer bank to ensure payment to it from the consumer such as withdrawing the funds from consumer s bank account posting the amount to the consumer s credit card account or line of credit etc. The third common element is confirmation to the consumer of the funds withdrawal. The fourth common element is the crediting of the payment to the C B account. In some cases the biller acknowledges the crediting with nothing more than refraining from sending a past due bill.

In bill pay system the participants are a consumer C a biller B consumer C s bank Bank C biller B s bank Bank B and optionally a lockbox operator . Bank C maintains consumer C s bank account and a clearing account while Bank B maintains biller B s bank account and a clearing account . The material passing between the participants includes a bill a remittance comprising a check and a payment coupon an account statement an accounts receivable A R data file an encoded check which is check with MICR encoding and possibly a non sufficient funds NSF notice .

The flow of material between participants in bill pay system begins arrow when biller B sends bill through the postal mails to consumer C. Bill indicates a C B account number and an amount due and is typically divided into an invoice portion to be retained by consumer C and a payment coupon portion to be returned each of which shows the C B account number and amount due.

In response to receiving bill consumer C sends remittance to biller B arrow . Remittance contains check drawn on consumer C s account at Bank C and payment coupon preferably included in the return envelope provided by biller B. Biller B then MICR encodes the amount of the remittance onto check to create encoded check and deposits check arrow and credits consumer C s account in biller B s customer general ledger G L account database . Alternately remittance is mailed to lockbox operator arrow A which opens remittance MICR encodes check to create encoded check captures the C B account number and amount of the check electronically to create A R data file . Lockbox operator then sends A R data file to biller B and sends encoded check to Bank B to be credited to biller B s account arrow A . Because check is signed by consumer C it authorizes Bank C to pass the amount of the check to Bank B after Bank B presents the check to Bank C. The signed check serves as the second common element of a bill pay transaction authorization.

However encoded check reaches Bank B Bank B then presents check to Bank C along with other checks received by Bank B which were drawn on Bank C accounts arrow . When Bank C receives check it withdraws the amount of the check from C s account and passes the funds to B s account at Bank B arrow . Actually this funds transfer occurs from C s account to clearing account to clearing account and then to B s account possibly with one or more intermediate settlement banks in the chain omitted for clarity .

If the funds are not available in C s account to cover the amount of check or if C s account has been closed then Bank C will return the check to Bank B who will in turn return the check to biller B. Biller B will then have to reverse the transaction crediting consumer C s C B account in G L database and renegotiate payment from consumer C all at significant cost to biller B. Even if check clears the process of providing good funds to biller B is not instantaneous since check must physically travel from biller B to Bank B to Bank C. Of course if biller B has sufficient credit rating with Bank B Bank B could move the funds from clearing account to B s account when Bank B receives check .

At some time following the clearing of check biller B also updates its A R records in G L database to credit consumer C s C B account and Bank C confirms to consumer C the withdrawal of the amount of check by listing it on statement and or by the return of cancelled check . If the check doesn t clear then biller B and other parties to the transaction unwind the payment.

One benefit of bill pay system is that for nearly all billers there is no need for biller enrollment any consumer can pay a biller without prior arrangements or a waiting period .

Similar to the above system is the GIRO systems used in several countries in Northern Europe. The GIRO systems were set up there either by the government or the postal system which is a traditional supplier of financial services. In a GIRO system it is mandated that each bill payer and each bill payee be assigned a GIRO number. The biller sends bills with its biller GIRO number on the payment coupons. The layout shape etc. of the GIRO payment coupons is also mandated so a consumer will receive similar coupons with each bill. After reviewing the bill the consumer simply adds their GIRO number to the payment coupon and signs it. Thus the payment coupon also serves as a banking instrument similar to a check.

The consumers in a GIRO system are comfortable with it because the payment coupons all look the same. The consumer then mails the payment coupons to either a GIRO central processor or its own bank which then sorts them by biller GIRO number and submits them to the biller. Since the payment coupons are all in a fixed format they can be easily encoded in a machine readable format including the payment amount which the biller pre prints onto the coupon. If the consumer gives their GIRO number to the biller the biller can also pre print that number on the payment coupon as well. Since all the coupons look the same the banks can process them like a check and achieve economies of scale.

Bill pay system includes most of the same participants as bill pay system consumer C Bank C Bank B possibly a lockbox operator not shown in and biller B who is typically not a proactive or willing participant in this system. Additionally a service bureau S and a Bank S are participants with service bureau S maintaining a service database which is used to match bill payment orders with billers. The material passing among the participants includes bill as in the prior example as well as a bill payment order and related confirmation of receipt both typically transmitted electronically an enrollment package a biller confirmation a bill payment check and list which includes check .

In bill pay system consumer C enrolls in bill pay system by sending service bureau S arrow enrollment package comprising a voided check and list of billers to be paid by S on behalf of C. S subsequently sends biller B biller confirmation arrow to verify arrow that C is indeed a customer of B.

With bill pay system consumer C identifies the proper biller by the remittance envelope and the payment coupon neither of which is available to service bureau S in bill pay system . Thus service bureau S must identify the correct biller for each bill payment order some other way. Typically service bureau S does this by asking consumer C for biller B s name address telephone number and consumer C s account number with biller B C B account number . Since neither Bank C nor service bureau S may have any account relationship with biller B they must rely upon consumer C s accuracy in preparing enrollment package which is used to put biller B s information into service database . Service bureau S typically requires this information only once during biller enrollment storing it to service database for use with subsequent payments directed to the same billers. Of course if this information changes service database would be out of date. If this information is wrong to start with or becomes wrong after a change service bureau S might send funds to the wrong entity. What a service bureau will often do to reduce errors in biller identification is to not allow the consumer to make payments to a biller for a specified time period after enrolling the biller to allow service bureau S to verify biller B and the C B account structure with biller B in a biller confirmation message .

Sometime later consumer C receives bill arrow and initiates bill payment order arrow . Bill payment order includes authorization for service bureau S to withdraw funds from C s account to pay bill the amount to pay not necessarily the amount due on bill the date on which to pay and some indication of biller B as the payee. Service bureau S responds with confirmation of receipt indicating that bill pay order was received arrow . Consumer C can send bill pay order in any number of ways such as using a personal computer and modem directly or through a packet of other data network via an automatic teller machine ATM video touch screen a screen phone or telephone Touch Tone pad TTP interacting with a voice response unit VRU . However this is done service bureau S receives one or more bill pay orders from consumer C. These orders could be instructions to pay some amount for a bill or a set amount of money at periodic intervals.

Assuming that service bureau S has correctly identified and confirmed that biller B is a biller which consumer C desired to pay with bill pay order then service bureau S passes the funds to biller B as biller payment arrow after securing funds to cover the remittance. Bill payment can take several forms as discussed below. In a check and list is depicted which is common in the art. A check and list comprises a single payment check drawn on service bureau S s account accompanied by a list of all consumers whose individual remittances are aggregated in the single check. The list shows C B account numbers and payment amounts for each consumer included on the list which should total to the amount of the single check . This process brings some economies of scale to service bureau S although at additional expense to biller B. In some cases rather than endure the expense of checking over the list to ensure it matches the check amount biller B will refuse to accept that form of payment.

To secure funds service bureau S clears check through Bank S drawn on C s account at Bank C arrows . S then sends payment to biller B arrow . Biller B must treat payment as an exception item posting G L database from the list instead of payment coupons as in bill pay system . Biller B deposits check with Bank B arrow who clears it through Bank S and a settlement account to obtain good funds for B s account arrows . If the bill pay transaction goes through Bank C will confirm that it went through by sending a confirmation typically statement to consumer C. The cycle is completed arrow when consumer C receives notice that funds were withdrawn from C s account for the amount entered in bill pay order .

Several variations of the system shown in are used today. In one variation S sends an individual check unsigned signature on file drawn on C s account to biller B in response to bill pay order . This clears as in bill pay system arrows but B must process these one at a time since they are exception items. This reduces the possibility that B will refuse to process check since it only differs from the expected payment form by lacking a coupon. Thus biller B is less likely to refuse this form of payment over a check and list and the biller is less likely to have problems of the list not balancing or having bad account numbers.

In a second variation instead of a check from Bank C cleared through Bank S to credit S s account S has Bank S submit a debit to C s account through the Automated Clearing House ACH see and accompanying text . In a third variation in place of arrows check and list S may send A R data and a credit to biller B through one path of i Bank S to ACH to Bank B to biller B or ii MasterCard s RPS Remittance Processing System to Bank B to biller B. As used here the RPS is merely an alternative to the ACH. In a fourth variation a combination of the second and third variations S sends simultaneous ACH transactions debit account and credit account .

Bill pay system while providing more efficient remittance processing by biller B due to its increased control over the process leaves consumer C with very little control over the bill pay transactions after the relationship is set up since consumer C is typically required to give biller B an open ended authorization to withdraw funds. Furthermore bill pay system is not appropriate for all types of billers such as those who do not have an on going and predictable relationship with consumers.

For bill pay system to work properly there is an enrollment phase arrows and an operational phase arrows . In the enrollment phase consumer C gives biller B voided check which biller B uses to initiate pre authorization message . Biller B is not allowed by ACH to directly submit pre authorization message which means Bank B an ACH Originating Financial Depository Institution OFDI must get involved and submit message to Bank C an ACH Receiving Financial Depository Institution RFDI . After pre authorization message is accepted by Bank C Bank C will accept Bank B initiated automatic debits to be posted to C s account . In the operational phase biller B queries customer database to determine if consumer C is enrolled as an automatic debitor. If so biller B optionally sends debit advice to consumer C and sends debit request message to biller B s bank Bank B which then sends it through the ACH to Bank C which debits C s account and transfers the funds to biller B s account via the ACH. The transaction is confirmed to consumer C on bank statement sent to consumer C from Bank C. In this system debit request message might be rejected by Bank C for among other reasons non sufficient funds resulting in the flows along arrows .

One issue that the bandwidth market raises is the question of where to place certain DVNS functions. The current strategy of many bandwidth providers is built upon a DVNS that runs and operates completely at the distributor. However there may be some benefit to a bandwidth provider in moving part of the DVNS functions from the distributor to a Network Business Center NBC or Network Operations Control Center NOCC . In particular by placing most of the DVNS Operations Manager functionality at a centralized location the bandwidth provider may have a much better view on the state of the network. In an exemplary model each DVNS is responsible for setting up calls for their CPEs. While the DVNS has a good idea of how its customers are using the network the NOCC may not have a good handle on the overall network. By moving call setup to a central location the bandwidth provider s operators can get a complete overview of what is happening on the network at all times. This eliminates the possibility of a DVNS over allocating bandwidth to its customers.

In addition to providing better network management capabilities centralized call setup opens up some interesting possibilities. As a single system will know the state of the network at all times it could potentially increase prices in those areas where demand is greatest. Armed with real time call information a centralized management system could analyze the information and automatically raise the bandwidth providers wholesale prices in high traffic areas. On a similar note the bandwidth providers could also lower their prices in areas where the network is underutilized in order to stimulate demand. Assuming bandwidth demand is elastic this would allow a bandwidth provider to price its wholesale services at the exact point where supply hits demand optimizing its revenues.

In order to maintain a sense of autonomy a bandwidth provider could offer its distributors a series of APIs that allow them access to Operations Management functions at the central location. In addition a graphical user interface could be developed to permit remote configuration and management. The central application could be designed in such a way that distributors would only have access to their managed partition.

One downside of this approach is the need to split the Operations and Service Managers. As the Service Manager provides the distributors with specific functions that map their value added services or content to the bandwidth providers they will need to be tailored to each distributor. For this reason the Service Manager will probably need to reside at the distributor s location. Any hooks between the Service Manager and Operations Manager that are required to map content to a bandwidth provider s services will have to traverse the bandwidth provider s network.

Another downside to a centralized call setup mechanism is that it represents a single point of failure. However this could be solved by providing a backup system located at another site.

It is important to note that the bandwidth market will work irrespective of where the DVNS Operations Management functions are located.

The service provider may use a process that basically uses what is called the 3 minute switch time which is a expected time of telephone usage for a call to be made from one party to another. This is the basis for capacity management. With data video and other communication methods coming into the marketplace this method becomes more and more obsolete. By developing detailed Demand Management models the present invention allows one to look at the causes for usage of this capacity based on Economics Demographics Population Business Retail shifts and the impact it will have on the Network capacity. The Business goals and objectives of the Service Providers may also be integrated to establish an approved working model approved model by the Service Provider that may be executed over the eSpace as part of a collaborative process in an end to end supply chain. This may be applied at any point of the supply chain.

Theses Demand Management models may also be built based on a causal forecast standpoint based on demographics and economic models based on demand to support the business goals and objectives of a service provider. Demand planning tools are used to integrate information into how clients meet their individual business demands. They choose which one they want and they execute it through the supply chain. With modeling the issues focus more on What do I need and how do I deploy it and determine optimal deployment. Also there may be a lot of installation planning by gathering information through the supply chain how it should be built when it should be built and where to build it. Quickly and expeditiously. So what it becomes is multi company materials management utilizing e tools.
