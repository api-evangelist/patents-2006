title: Rails for electromagnetic hypervelocity launcher
abstract: 


where E is Young's modulus for the rail, I is moment of inertia for the rail, k is foundation modulus for the support, ρ is density for the rail and A is the cross-sectional area of the rail. The launcher is configured such that the critical velocity increases along the axial direction towards the muzzle. In particular, a material term √E/ρ of the rail increases along the axial direction, such for the rail being made from a first material being proximate to the breech and a second material being proximate to the muzzle, such that the material term √E/ρ of the second material being greater than that of the first material. Alternatively, the rail is made into a first shape being proximate to the breech and a second shape being proximate to the muzzle, such that a shape term √I/A of the second shape is greater than that of the first shape.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to electromagnetic launcher rails and more particularly to such methods and configurations that preferably can improve durability and performance of rails for launching a projectile at high speed.

An electromagnetic launcher utilizes electromagnetic force to propel an electrically conductive payload. Electrically conductive rails may be disposed in a longitudinal launch direction from breech to muzzle ends. Electric current flowing through the rails induces a magnetic field. This field produces a mutual repulsion force between the rails and accelerates the payload along at least one of the rails.

An armature pushes the projectile for release through the muzzle. Physical and design constraints present limitations as to launch speeds and rail ability to perform after firing multiple loads without failure.

Conventional rails yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In contrast various exemplary embodiments introduce a family of geometric and material configurations for an electromagnetic launcher to provide increased critical velocity preferably above the launch speed for a given launcher. Consequently the launcher rails may operate below damaging resonant regimes. The operational life of the rails and launcher may be significantly extended thereby.

In particular the electromagnetic launcher provided for accelerating a projectile from an initial speed at a breech end to a launch speed at a muzzle end includes a containment tube a rail contained therein and a support. The tube may include an inner concave surface or annulus along an axial direction. The rail is contained within the inner concave surface and includes an inside load surface to support the projectile and an outer interface surface. The support may be disposed between the interface surface and the inner concave surface to provide an electrically insulating structural buffer between the rail and the tube.

Physical and material characteristics of the rail and the support may limit the practical maximum speed called critical velocity at which a load may travel therealong. Critical velocity may be expressed as

Various exemplary embodiments provide for launcher configurations having values of critical velocities that exceed operational launch velocities of the projectiles. This principle may be implemented using design for critical velocity increasing along the axial direction towards the muzzle. For example a material term E of the rail increases along the axial direction such for the rail being made from a first material being proximate to the breech and a second material being proximate to the muzzle such that the material term E of the second material being greater than of the first material. Alternatively or additionally the rail may be formed into a first shape being proximate to the breech and a second shape being proximate to the muzzle such that a shape term I A of the second shape is greater than of the first shape.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

In railroad and rocket sled technologies tracks that support rapidly moving loads may experience resonance induced deflections. Such conditions may occur in response to load transport that approaches an effective critical velocity causing derailment and or track fracture. Further details of this phenomenon are described in Critical Velocity for Rails in Hypervelocity Launchers by N. V. Nechitailo and K. B. Lewis expected to be published in late 2006 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

A launcher may use gas pressure or magnetic force to accelerate a projectile between the breech and the muzzle. If the projectile speed rises to approach critical velocity the stresses and responding strains may increase significantly to yield displacements that cause premature wear and structural damage thereby shortening the useful life of the launcher system and its components.

The buckling of slender beams can be characterized by critical velocity described further herein. A structural member having longitudinal length orders of magnitude greater than lateral and transverse dimensions may be characterized as a long slender beam. Commonly used beam models include the Bernoulli Euler beam and the Timoshenko beam.

A Bernoulli Euler beam supported on a continuous elastic foundation may respond to a concentrated transverse load moving along the beam similarly to the beam response to a longitudinal compressive force. The beam exhibits buckling with significant transverse displacements and bending moments. A Timoshenko beam includes shear stresses and rotational inertia effects on the beam deformation.

A projectile launched along rails may be modeled as a concentrated load moving along a beam s length. A transverse deflection may be characterized by displacement w according to the following relation 

The mass term A can also be expressed as q g for q as the weight of rail per unit length and g as gravitational acceleration. The foundation modulus k is analogous to the bulk compressive modulus for the substrate material that supports the rail. See Timoshenko S. Method of Analysis of Statical and Dynamic Stresses in Rail 2 Zurich 1927 pp. 1 12. The bulk modulus B E 3 6 where is Poisson s Ratio.

Timoshenko compared the influence of load speed on the magnitude of rail deflection to an additional compressive force S as S AV. 2 Buckling may occur when the critical value of compressive force Ssatisfies the relation 2 3 Substituting for compressive force S the critical velocity Vcan be approximately solved as 

A cross section of an exemplary launcher is shown in . The launcher may include a tubular containment shell i.e. tube or container made of steel having an inner concave surface into which are disposed top and bottom rails made of aluminum. The cross section of the tube may be circular or noncircular and further may comprise one or more elements. Each rail may include an inside load surface and an outer tube facing surface.

Gaps or a sleeve between the rails specifically its tube facing surface and the tube may be filled with an electrical insulator such as G 10 fiberglass. The gap serves to physically separate the rails and the tube for preventing electrical conduction therebetween that would cause a short circuit. Hence the material contained within the gap may serve as an electrical insulator. Similar adjacent spaces may also be disposed inside the tube laterally from the rails and filled with the fiberglass.

In the configuration shown each rail possesses a rectangular cross section. The projectile and armature together representing a payload to be accelerated travel along the launcher against the inside load surfaces of the rails . For a rectangular cross section the moment of inertia of each rail is I bh 12 with the corresponding cross sectional area being A bh.

Example dimensions for the rectangular cross section include rail base width of b 0.0762 m 3 in and rail thickness height h 0.0125 m 0.5 in . The resulting moment of inertia and area are I 1.240 10mand A 9.525 10m respectively. This wide rectangular cross section is shown in .

The relevant material characteristics include for the aluminum rail Young s modulus E 69 GPa and density 2750 kg m. Recall that a pascal equals one Newton per square meter and the giga prefix represents thousand million. The fiberglass support provides a value for foundation modulus k 4.72 GPa. From these values the critical velocity is V 1.239 km s.

Upon launch the projectile accelerates along the rails of the electromagnetic launcher. The projectile s speed increase may cause that speed to approach the critical velocity Vdetermined for the portion of track being loaded by the projectile. Thus to avoid localized rail buckling various exemplary embodiments provide for the critical velocity to increase accordingly along the launcher length from the breech to the muzzle. In order to concurrently facilitate operation and maintenance exemplary embodiments provide for segments of the rail that exhibit differing material or geometric characteristics.

Critical velocity may be increased by replacing the rail material and or the rail cross section and or replacing the support material. In particular a material term E of the rail may be selected to increase along the axial direction. Alternatively or additionally a shape term I A that characterizes the rail shape may be selected to increase along the axial direction.

As an alternate example aluminum may be replaced by steel as the rail material for the original rectangular cross section. This material change may structurally strengthen the rail but exhibit reduced electrical conduction properties. For cast steel Young s modulus E 197 GPa and density 7830 kg m. Although the modulus of elasticity increases by a factor of 2.86 the effect on critical velocity serves as a multiplier of only 1.30 while the density increases by a factor of 2.85 and serves as a divisor of 1.69. Consequently this material change from aluminum to steel reduces the critical velocity Vto 0.955 km s. The multiplier represents a ratio of E E .

Similarly titanium has properties of Young s modulus E 116 GPa and density 4507 kg m yielding a decrease in critical velocity to 1.102 km s. Also similarly copper has properties of Young s modulus E 130 GPa and density 8920 kg m yielding a decrease in the critical velocity to 0.806 km s.

In contrast a material change to a light weight material having high strength such as beryllium yields properties of Young s modulus E 287 GPa and density 1846 kg m increasing the critical velocity to 2.160 km s for an increase of 74.3 percent. Alternatively employment of a non metal such as carbon with Young s modulus E 200 GPa and density 1570 kg m yields an increase in the critical velocity to 2.139 km s for an increase of 72.6 percent.

Other candidate materials for consideration include silicon carbide having Young s modulus E 450 GPa and density 3200 kg m and beryllium oxide having Young s modulus E 380 GPa and density 2850 kg m. These material substitutions increase the critical velocity V 1.649 km s for silicon carbide and 1.505 km s for beryllium oxide. These represent critical velocity increases over aluminum rails of between of 33.1 and 21.4 percent respectively. Designs using these ceramics may necessitate incorporation of an electrically conductive material in a portion of the rail cross section to provide electrical connection along the launcher .

As a second alternate example fiberglass may be replaced by ceramic as the support material. The ceramic support provides an estimated value for foundation modulus k 154 GPa. For the previously described flat aluminum rail cross section and ceramic support the corresponding critical velocity would be V 2.961 km s for an increase of 139 percent. Carbon fiber represents lighter substitute support material with an estimated foundation modulus of k 120 GPa. For the previously described flat aluminum rail cross section and graphite support the corresponding critical velocity would be V 2.782 km s for an increase of 125 percent. Although carbon is somewhat more conductive than most ceramics an electrically insulative material may be interposed between the support and the rail .

As a third alternate example the rail cross section geometry may be altered to increase height and reduce the base width for the same cross sectional area. This second cross section is shown in . For the height multiplied by a factor of 1.5 and the base divided the same factor the cross sectional area would remain the same. Nonetheless the corresponding moment of inertia yields I 2.791 10m. This geometry change produces a corresponding critical velocity V 1.517 km s for an increase of 22.5 percent.

As a fourth alternate example the rail cross section geometry of may be altered from a rectangle to a T beam cross section with a stem extending from the base midline to the tube wall. This third cross section is shown in with the stem thickness c 0.0125 m and the stem length d 0.145 m. The cross sectional area increases to A bh cd 1.134 10m. The T beam moment of inertia is calculated by the relations 

As a fifth alternate example the rail cross section geometry may be altered from a rectangle to a concave arc segment of a hollow circle. This fourth cylindrical cross section is shown in with R representing the radius of curvature h representing thickness and being the half angle or arc. That corresponding moment of inertia can be reasonably be approximated by the relation 

Another modification of the rail may be performed by pre loading the rail in tension as shown in . This process may pre stretch and rigidly connect the rail at attach locations near its end points as shown or at select intervals to a containment or support member pre loaded in compression. As a pre tensioned beam the connected rail may buckle under higher moving compressive loads than absent pre tension thereby reducing rail buckling effects in the launcher.

Yet another modification of the rail may be made by altering the thickness of the rail along its length. shows an elevation view of a rail having a thin portion with a first height or thickness h towards the breech and a thick portion with a second height or thickness H towards the muzzle. Such an alteration in shape may be accompanied by continuous change along the segment axial length. Alternatively individual segments concatenated together may have uniform cross section and instead vary shape to affect moment of inertia segment by segment. These connected segments may preferably enable electrical conductivity between them for launch operation.

Artisans of ordinary skill will also recognize that combinations and or modifications of these material selections and geometries may be employed along portions of the rail to increase critical velocity without departing from the scope of the inventive concepts.

Various exemplary embodiments may vary material properties and or geometric characteristics as separate individual segments for portions of the rail as shown in . These segments may have uniform cross section or vary shape to affect moment of inertia segment by segment.

As a sixth alternate example the rails may form several layers of different and or alternating materials in a lamination as shown in . In particular some of the layers may possess high damping properties. The rail materials may preferably incorporate materials having high electrical conductivity along the longitudinal direction over at least a portion of the cross section to carry current for launch purposes.

The upper plot exhibits a displacement having small amplitude oscillations as the load travels along the rail representing a desirable outcome. The middle plot shows sharply increasing amplitude which may cause structural failure of the rail . The lower plot represents steady undamped oscillations that may detrimentally affect the rail s useful life by fatigue.

The electromagnetic rail gun may be isometrically visualized in within context of a generalized configuration of the rails . Current I travels from an electrical source along the rails in the longitudinal direction . This induces a magnetic field B around the rails that produces a mutual repulsive force F to accelerate the armature in the longitudinal direction . The armature pushes the projectile to be propelled out of the launcher .

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
