Nos. 6 614 893 6 842 511 and 7 058 601 by expanding from simple ILEC to national carriers global IP Telephony and Wireless Telecommunications Real Time billing. The concept of vector CDR is further expanded to include roaming surcharges and multi organization calls. The invention solves intrinsic drawbacks of clusters by dividing them into a grid of nodes that are able to move large amounts of data and can perform decisions on their own absent of the centralized Symmetric Multiprocessor SMP .

The system is thus a parallel cluster Supercomputer with at least one teraflop of bandwidth calibrated to move organizationally the equivalent of one terabyte per minute TB min of raw data.

An expert system Supercomputer is provided to incorporate a plurality of independent nodes also referred to herein as Intelligent Components which work together in an organized and managerial hierarchical manner to represent all of the products services human resources and consumers of the organization. The system will assimilate a plurality of concurrently working sovereign distribution centers such as Retailers Suppliers Wholesalers and UCommerce warehouses. This concept is further expanded to integrate geospatial components to each message from the environment and allows each network to interact with the MPS . The technology utilizes business rules to determine based on traffic volumes and available resources the node of the system that performs the match merge. Therefore Intelligent Components make decisions using business rules permitting them to perform complex tasks once the Quote or Order Owner builds the Vector CDR and they have all of the Partial Vector components. This ability of the lower nodes of the hierarchy to complete most tasks permits the system to avoid unnecessary and redundant activities.

An expert system Supercomputer commercially known as XCommerce works in an organized and hierarchical manner to represent all of the links content of the Internet and the massive traffic volumes derived from the consumers interactions with the environment.

The original Ph. D. dissertation was interested in solving the dilemma of having real time billing entities for a network the size of Telecom Italia with all of its complexity and associated environmental spaghetti. The invention was designed to work outside of the Legacy System by using school of management techniques quality assurance and integrated bundled mechanism of data migration match merge algorithms to correlate tariff billing entities and a billing engine that would make the information immediately available so to stop the 2 month billing cycle in arrears that had a net result of costing the organization between 200 and 400 million USD per year depending on severity of fraud. Fraud occurs when the bureaucratic Legacy System is unable to react in a proactive or reactive manner to the changing conditions of the environment and possesses implicit inefficiencies and limitations. By simulating the data flow of messages from the environment through means of simulation the results will elucidate pitfalls conditions of the networks that clog or saturate the system first arrange the resources of the system to coordinate the flow of data to handle a specific rated capacity then test the system when traffic approaches the critical mass or specific asymmetric conditions occur. As the volume increases arithmetically the tax burden on the available throughput increases exponentially complexity is directly proportional with the number of layers required to gather environmental information. The Tax burden phenomena becomes apparent once the critical mass is exceeded or traffic volumes are greater than 5 of the rated capacity. Under these dire conditions the unmanaged flow of traffic massive quantities of data moved and net effects of the tax burden of the system concurrently deteriorate and saturate the network. In a nutshell this technology optimal manages and coordinates throughput to avoid saturation during dire traffic conditions 

a Unmanaged systems get clogged quicker than managed ones do alternatively if they are managed into single nodes they decay as the number of nodes increase. Ex. for 1 024 nodes unmanaged nodes require 200 minutes to perform a synchronized network wide CO flush whereas 1 024 managed nodes will perform the same task in 17 minutes.

b The mechanism to distribute information to the centralized Symmetric Multiprocessors SMP further augmented the cost of throughput to perform a correlated billing entity increases geometrically with the number of dependent tiers. In this case the Legacy System uses the first tier of monitors to read and filter information the second tier to perform data manipulation and the summit tier to match merge correlated billing entities. The Modern System uses the first tier to read filter information and perform data manipulation and onwards to match merge correlated billing entities. The GES or MPS performs all of the tasks from the first tier onwards. The Legacy System has two dependent tier layers the Modern System and the MPS .

c The log of the lowest common denominator of grid unmanaged Network Platform Equipment is variable Z. This is described in the ratio of actual monitoring CPU to SMP. In this case the Legacy System has about 64 nodes per SMP the Modern System has about 16 nodes per SMP whereas the GES has 1 node that behaves as a SMP.

Accordingly after revamping the gathering means of the existing architectures the Legacy System would be able to perform data mitigation and the billing cycle in days and weeks instead of 2 months. Through means of a Modern System the process of data mitigation and the billing cycle were reduced by one magnitude level to hours and days whereas the commercial version of the GES known in the dissertation as the Hot Billing System reduced the magnitude by another level to minutes and hours and the Massive Mission Critical MPS further reduced the magnitude by another level to seconds and minutes As per conclusions of the dissertation Real Time Billing was just one step away.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 614 893 introduces the method of further programming the Intelligent Components not to just understand the proprietary multinational CDR obtained by the Black Box but instead to actually perform data mitigation and billing cycle through means of reading the SS7 signal packets IAM ACM ANM and REL messages. This improvement was the necessary step required to perform Real Time Billing reducing the magnitude by another level to seconds and minutes which constitutes the technological advantages of the Massive Mission Critical MPS . New methods were added to the managerial hierarchical system by granting each node the ability to share tasks with parents siblings subordinates with lateral and vertical synergy. The primary advantages are as follows 

a Pseudo Real Time Billing technologies match merge occurs after the fact using CDR information. Results show at best the data mitigation and billing cycle is made available within minutes and hours. These delays in gathering data can produce dire consequences on throughput of the system.

b Through means of lateral and vertical synergy the tax burden phenomena was virtually eliminated and contained within tolerable levels.

c The NEW definition of Real Time starts from the incipiency of a call as a SS7 IAM packet generated by the Network Platform Equipment and continuously changes the transactional fuzzy states as better data is obtained. The system updates the fuzzy state of the call as ACM packets notify a connected call ANM packets an active call and REL packets instruct the NPE that a call has terminated and to immediately discharge used resources.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 842 511 introduces the concept of reflecting a Telecommunications network and thus competitors and their usage of the system resources were contemplated still within the framework of a large fixed network. The primary advantages are the ability to create a Vector CDR that belongs to 3parties and to integrate the organization and its resources to the GES system and method.

CIP 2 develops the notion that the spaghetti of the Legacy System is transmitted as an echo of the environment to a mirror. This mirror that consists of the GES mimics replicates and simulates the activities of each NPE and in turn organizes the information based on geospatial X Y Z coordinates into geographical areas that are known as blocks. These blocks are responsible for standardizing all of the messages into a lingua franca simplifying the pits falls of the spaghetti through means of normalization and transforming the data into correlated billing entities with tariffs. The system further organizes and arranges a plurality of informational blocks into larger objects that resemble 3D pyramids like structures that are autonomous independent and having ownership of a specific geographical domain belonging to the superset U . For the basis of the building blocks the NPE object is used for determining the ownership of the CPE and their associated subscribers. For the basis of the building blocks the NPE is used as the point of reference for all of the CPE of its subordinate subscribers.

The hierarchical structure was incremented to accommodate global networks with HQ0 to HQ12 pyramid structures. It added the concept of having fixed and wireless networks working in parallel within the same framework and introduced the XO for cell sites. Within a territory an additional level of hierarchy was added to match merge the loose ends of calls that use both fixed and wireless networks that we named Hybrid Calls. Thus two concurrent running HQ0 to HQ5 would solve the issues of the ILEC territory and the newly added HQ6 tier would resolve hybrid calls.

Two additional groups of tiers were added to the traditional ILEC hierarchy to solve national long distance calls HQ7 to HQ9 and international calls HQ10 to HQ12. Finally the concept of Complex Calls was added. This is to satisfy calls that have classical characteristics Leg A point of origin and Leg B point of destination format with Leg X billable point of origin and Leg Y billable point of destination and several tandem circuits such as Legs T U . This call consists of two or more calls to instantiate a single call. For example a person that has a global network AT T Italia phone with a billing address of Rome Italy originates a call from Miami USA to a person that has a global network Nextel phone with a billing address in Buenos Aires Argentina that presently is in New York City USA. At least three calls must be tagged to make the connection.

One Vector Path could use AT T international call between Miami and Rome for billing purposes only and or physically if required.

One Vector Path could use Nextel international call between New York City and Buenos Aires for billing purposes and or physically if required.

For a complex call the origin and destination don t belong to the same network. Match Merging calls with missing gaps of information substantially lower informational entropy. If the originating person dials 01154 the call is an outbound from Miami to Argentina where Nextel rebroadcasts the call to New York City since the caller is registered to have a global plan it is possible that the Miami to Rome call will be symbolic and used for a billing purpose only the system will be able to route a domestic USA call and assign the international roaming surcharge.

CIP 3 was further updated and revamped to satisfy the needs of a commercial version as a Product in ICE Costa Rica and the first encounter was that four dimensions of telecommunications traffic are required 1 Fixed 2 IP 3 Wireless and 4 International wireless competition. To take advantage of cluster and grid technologies the basic pyramid structures evolved into sector regional and domain Switches. Thus the GES had a substantial evolution to the MPS that consists of a hierarchy of tiers of parallel cluster nodes to discrete segments of clusters that behaved like grids and covered a predefined geographical area and all of the NPE with the corresponding CPE based on the assigned geospatial X Y Z location. Note an object can only belong to a specific block and Switch like object.

Thus the basic Switch became to fruition by allowing clustering computer software with a modified Unix Shell to launch scripts based on predefined time intervals or socket ID instances and to begin integrating all the incompatible data structures protocols and technologies. Each CPE belonging to a specific NPE has geospatial demographic and financial characteristics. The Switch can instantiate block kill and listen to calls perform data mining data warehousing fault management provisioning routing and network trending in real time. Based on the size of the PTT the organization will be broken down into three geographical depending tiers as follows 

a The Managerial Pyramid Switch interacts with the Senior Management of the organization to allow it to control all of the human and NPE organizational resources to make strategic decisions derived from live network wide data. This Switch covers the entire domain of the organization or can be distributed amongst a cluster of these Switches for larger PTT. international and complex traffic 

b The Synergy Interface Switch interacts with the Middle Management of the organization to allow it to control all of the human and NPE organizational resources to make decision support and operating support decisions derived from live regional data. This Switch covers the entire region of the organization that covers an NPA Numbering Plan Area or LATA Local Access and Transport Area . long distance traffic 

c The Team Work Switch interacts with Engineering Field Crews and MIS to manage and control the integrity and stability of the different technologies NPE to deliver to the end user the best quality product and service. This Switch covers a sector of the organization that covers a plurality of CO XO and ISP within an Exchange NXX or NPA. local traffic 

All of the components work collectively and independently from each other and still simultaneously perform the task analyzing evaluating gathering and processing information from the environment in real time. New messages occur at the moment of incipiency of receiving the fuzzy logic IAM ACM ANM or REL messages from the environment. Intelligent Components are the basic elements of the system. These are new attributes to them that supersede previous Business Rules 

b Intelligent Components can mimic replicate and simulate Fixed IP VOIP and or Wireless Network Platform Equipments.

c Each Intelligent Component is assigned a primary function with their Switch to control the NPE. When nodes match merge calls that belong to their primary functions they can complete a Vector CDR as if one level higher in the hierarchy. For example a primary function fixed HQ0 can complete a Vector CDR that is Intra CO and Intra NXX calls.

e For Simple Calls having Legs A B T belonging to a single network the system determines the Leg A owner which in turn assigns the Vector CDR owner.

f For Simple Calls if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Synergy Interface Switch domain by the system the Team Work Switch Leg A owner will complete the Vector CDR. If the Leg A owner TWS does not have Leg B data it creates Partial Vector Legs A T information and requests the owner of the leg B owner TWS to send the partial Leg B. Then the TWS Leg A owner has to match merge Partial Vector Legs A B T to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path.

g For Simple Calls if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Managerial Pyramid Switch domain by the system the Synergy Interface Switch Leg A owner will complete the Vector CDR. If the SIS Leg A owner does not have Leg B data it creates all of the Partial Vector Legs A T information and requests the owner of the leg B owner SIS to send the partial Leg B. Then the SIS Leg A owner has to match merge Partial Vector Legs A B T to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path.

h Hybrid Calls having Partial Vector Legs A B T U X Y I J K belong to the exact two networks. The system determines the Leg A owner which in turn assigns the Vector CDR owner.

i The system will create two Sub Vectors CDR where each has complete Legs A B side information of a call from the point of view of a single network. Thus a Hybrid Call will have exactly two Sub Vectors CDR and Complex calls more than three.

j By means of the Vector CDR and its corresponding data structure bitmap information the system will know that the Hybrid Call had a total cost by adding origin tandem and destination components Sub Vector CDR.

k For Hybrid Calls if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Team Work Switch domain by the system the Team Work Switch Leg A owner node will complete the Vector CDR. If Leg A owner node does not have Leg B data it creates Partial Vector Legs A T information that belongs to the same network which sends it to the partial Leg A node of its superior TWS and requests the owner of Leg B owner node to send the Partial Vector Leg B that belongs to the other network. Then the TWS has to match merge Partial Vector Legs A B T to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path and the two complete Sub Vectors CDR that belong to each network.

l For Hybrid Calls if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Synergy Interface Switch domain by the system the Team Work Switch Leg A owner node will complete the Vector CDR. If Leg A owner node does not have Leg B data it creates Partial Vector Legs A T information that belongs to the same network and to the Partial A function of its superior SIS and requests the SIS superior of Leg B owner node to send the Partial B function that belongs to the other network. Then the SIS Leg A owner has to match merge Partial Vector Legs A B T to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path and the two complete Sub Vectors CDR that belong to each network.

m For Hybrid Calls if the Call Ownership is deemed to belong to the Managerial Pyramid Switch domain the Synergy Interface Switch Leg A owner node will complete the Vector CDR. If Leg A owner node does not have Leg B data it creates Partial Vector Legs A T information that belongs to the same network which sends it to the Partial A function of its superior SIS and requests the SIS superior of Leg B owner node to send the Partial B function that belongs to the other network. Then the MPS Leg A owner can match merge Partial Vector Legs A B T to create the resultant Vector CDR that possesses the entire vector trajectory path and the two complete Sub Vectors CDR that belonged to each network.

n For larger and complex networks a CORE MPS might exist to load balance a plurality of MPS and to allow a smoother transition of information between the system and the power users.

p Complex Calls that possess Partial Vector Legs A B T U X Y I J K V W C D belong to a plurality of networks. The system determines the Leg A owner which in turn assigns the Vector CDR owner.

q The Sub Vector CDR within its bitmap data structure has all of the associated components to reverse engineer a Complex Call from origin to destination within a network environment F I or W .

t Each Switch has a specialized Parser Function that distributes the flow of IAM ACM ANM and REL messages to the appropriate node with the new rules mentioned above.

u To block or kill a call Leg A owner instantiates REL messages and forward chains through the system.

w To communicate with a Customer Service Representative through a specific ANI the system will send a message to the NPE to play a specific voice message.

x The Customer Service Representative can then call a specific ANI to interact with the system or alternatively instantiate a new call using specialized software that creates network packets.

y Intelligent Data Warehouse HQ2 or has large data repositories and uses parts of the throughput to perform specialized Data Mining and Data Warehousing activities through means of the integrated 3party licensed Database.

z The Parser Function directly receives through the GNOC centers an echo of a plurality of trunks and circuits that belong to a specific Sector or Region and can be mapped directly to a specific NPE. These nodes are directly connected via fiber to each of the nodes so latency is minimized. When an Intelligent Component wants to communicate to the network this node is the one that performs the live Central Office rerouting block or killing of calls and instantiation of new calls.

The CORE MPS is the means by which the power users of the system can perform real time changes to the system and can request system integrity and performance updates to better make tactical and strategic decisions. End users that want to monitor their available credit as a call progresses via ADSL can do so through this node.

The Internet is considered a global telecommunications network with 1 000 000 000 subscribers and thus most of the business rules apply. UCommerce and XCommerce are business intelligence applications designed to give the end users the latest information. In order to eliminate redundancy raw data must be converted by a Supercomputer into primed data with patterns of behavior for real time financial evaluation to dynamically adapt to the changes of the environment.

The parallel clustered multi tiered Supercomputer consists of a plurality of nodes where each one is programmed with Artificial Intelligence software programs commercially known as Intelligent Components or IC to perform processing power predefined and ad hoc tasks based that must be logistical rationalized based on the requirements derived from the environment.

The cluster is also known as the Superset U . The cluster is divided into three geospatial tiers a Global b Regional and c local possessing specialized Data Mitigation Network Trending Provisioning Data Mart and Business Intelligence functionality relying on a sharable Extreme Large Data Base XLDB tier. Each of the nodes or IC is assigned a geospatial area of coverage range from 0 small geographical areas to 7 the world a managerial hierarchy system denoted as HQ. Each Intelligent Component possesses the following characteristics and functions 

a Data base means with real time information of the inventory and the latest prices of retailers suppliers wholesalers and UCommerce warehouses that will give customers products and services delivered door to door at the optimal price and time. The system will consider the world as a single supra macro region and thus the consumer will readily have available same ocean land and air cargo such as blue red and black label services from local regional or global products and services. This method offers small and large customers the ability to locally buy and sell worldwide merchandise thus allowing them to compete anywhere in the world without the need of storing physical inventory.

b Total Quality Management or TQM functionality that analyzes and identifies product quality and service designed to determine customer satisfaction and perceived value.

c Data Manipulation or DM process consists of gathering reading priming and inserting Network Platform Equipment transactions into a structured format that can be used for billing call routing and vectoring fault management fraud detection and network statistics.

d Management Information Systems or MIS methods that organize transform distribute and replicate organizational detailed and summarized lingua franca information created by each transactional processes and activities are transformed and organized into a relational manner from the environment.

e Expert Information Systems or EIS mechanism permits business intelligence software to evaluate information in a structured way for decision makers such as the CEO and a president of an organization to understand where and why things happen in an organization. With this information the visionaries of an organization can make tactical adjustments and strategic course corrections.

f Inventory Control means depending on the Intelligent Component s assigned managerial hierarchical geospatial area of coverage assignment as Local Regional or Global.

All of the Intelligent Components work collectively and independently from each other and still simultaneously perform the task analyzing evaluating gathering and processing information from the environment in real time or from the moment of incipiency of receiving the fuzzy logic piece of information that triggers new and updates pending activities or tasks. The cluster of computers must be subdivided into a superset set subset and element grouping the following Managerial Pyramid Switch architecture with local regional global and informational sub cluster partitioning to help build three geospatial tiers 

The Summit Tier or Managerial Pyramid Switch or MPS Information Portal HQ7 coordinates the Data Mart cluster used for Business Intelligence and Invoicing that work with Crusader Technology Software via the Internet that allows users to have access to their business and personal information in real time. The system analyzes each Crusader Technology Software interaction to better understand what the client values in order to keep the subscriber satisfied. HQ6 is the master node of the cluster U that has control of all of the financial institutions interfaces human resources and Network Platform Equipments of an organization. Consequently each Intelligent Component has the four cluster configurations as follows HQx I J K y T where x ranges from 0 local to 7 global geospatial scope I Global Superset J Region Set K Local subset y denotes the element and T XLDB or Data Mart Cluster.

The Middleware Tier or Synergy Interface Switch or SIS controls UCommerce warehouses based on continent HQ5 continental region HQ4 or LATA Local Access and Transport Districts HQ3.

The Lower Tier or Team Work Switch or TWS controls a plurality of points of presence based on the organization suppliers HQ2 warehouses HQ1 or retailers HQ0. These HQ2 to HQ0 collectively constitute the workhorse of the system and Intelligence has control of users requests and replies to the system. These Intelligent Components coordinate and synchronize the entire billing provisioning and TQM functionality requests and replies. They also have the ability to interact with 3parties organizations and supply them with a summary of all of the data they have processed.

Virtually simulate 3parties organization functionality by storing via software interface district via TWS region via SIS or globally via MPS to reduce the need of having to rely on the centralized mainframe. Each Intelligent Component or Intelligent Data Warehouse must only synchronize the latest inventory once every predefined cycle and then the artificial intelligence programming will optimize and maximize its organizational management logistics. The nodes of the system will interact directly with the provisioning and physical or queued inventory of each member of a 3party distribution means.

Intelligent Components can request to members of the same group or Team Work Switch any excess buffer resources to complete a task lateral synergy . Members of a TWS can coordinate the resources of any parent and their subordinates to complete a task. Members of different regional cluster can synergistically collaborate to process tasks via Synergy Interface Switch and perform worldwide tasks thanks to the summit cluster or Managerial Pyramid Switch .

Intelligent Components can be programmed to behave and to be the substitute of one or more nodes in performing organizational tasks so that collectively the HIVE works as a Super Intelligent Component engulfing a global supplier system. The supplier system has specialized interaction means with the environment that gather distill analyze and then standardize and convert the raw information into primed lingua franca data which in turn is quantified qualified organized and transformed so that Information Entropy is achieved and consequently the chaos and anarchy or Spaghetti Phenomena is eliminated.

Collectively multiple Intelligent Components work together to parallel and simulate an existing organization that possesses an UCommerce supplier system.

Each primed lingua franca message by the system has a single version of the truth vector trajectory that assigns a discrete amount of Intelligent Components so they can communicate amongst themselves or members of the organization and the Internet clients. Based on the vector trajectory each message has an owner and the path of all of the participating Intelligent Components required to process a given activity so they can communicate amongst themselves via forward and rearward chaining. Proactively the human resources of the organization use business intelligence software that can send parameters to the master node of each TWS subset SIS set and MPS superset that permits humans to control coordinate and synchronize directly their network. The software sends the parameters to a single or plurality of clusters so they can optimally analyze assign calculate distribute prioritize and weight the rate of messages and timing limitations for the next queue of incoming messages based on the conditions of the environment and historical trends.

Each Intelligent Component is also an independent working entity or an element of a given superset set or subset grouping with the following characteristics 

a HQ3 and higher are also Intelligent Data Warehouses performing data warehouse functions and are programmed to monitor and control multiple nodes. They act as virtual simulation of the organization. HQ2 HQ1 and HQ0 that are designed to remove redundancy geospatially distribute activities and to correlate and update information.

b Intelligent Components are programmed to valorize with supply side economics the limited resources and capacities of the network with their parents peers and subordinates lateral and vertical synergy so that the system does not tax the capacity of the existing network in real time.

c Intelligent Components are programmed to immediately create plot and update purchase orders as soon as new messages from the environment are processed.

d Intelligent Components analyze the latest environmental conditions to manage and organize the flow of information within their organization from predefined point A to point B routes to avoid clogs and saturation maximize throughput and assign and prioritize cluster nodes via synergy that have substantial buffer resources since unused resources are considered waste or garbage which is the independent variable that is directly related in creating the Spaghetti Phenomena .

e Thus network traffic is analyzed by supersets sets subsets groups of elements and by element domain based on the known latest working conditions of each Intelligent Component network routing traffic patterns and throughput limitation of each given domain. The TWS SIS and MPS perform the non obvious task of removing complexity in order to be a real time system by eliminating data redundancy filtering quantifying qualifying data as good or garbage and minimizing waste before beginning to transmit the data through the managerial hierarchy system.

f Intelligent Components are programmed to eliminate the Spaghetti Phenomena at the point of attack so that the system can reach Information Entropy at the organizational level which is a necessary condition to be considered a real time invention.

g Intelligent Data Warehouses stabilize the flow of financial conditions criteria inventories shipping cost and tariffs required for billing and update to the Information System or XLDB Data Mart with transactional statistics that are made available to the rest of the Intelligent Components to better optimize resources and available bandwidth.

h Each Intelligent Component is programmed to be autonomous and through means of the managerial hierarchy and synergy can work in parallel with others to function as a single unit. They process all of the information forming a virtual instance organizational environment.

i The members of the hierarchical management pyramid analyze update monitor control validate verify and administer information that in turn eliminates the Spaghetti Phenomena which in turn permits Informational Entropy once primed data has balance harmony and proportion. This fact alone removes the need for a central mainframe and also shows that garbage in equals to garbage out and that raw data derived from the chaos and anarchy of the environment is meaningless and that the real time solution consists of simultaneously synchronizing the workload MIS optimizing throughput Engineering proactively satisfying clients demands TQM and updating human intelligence with good information EIS and the fact that they are all of the required or mandatory at once is not obvious in nature.

j Each Intelligent Component has its own location identification means one said summit parent simulation computer being located at each of a plurality of subordinates. Depending on the size of the network the architecture of how computers are linked together might require a plurality of scopes each with its own parent and subordinate. For the purposes of this invention retailers wholesalers and suppliers are available. Furthermore each node must belong to the main cluster or HIVE and to a geospatial specific domain local regional or global cluster.

Every single activity and purchase order is made in parallel starting from the point of origin and ending at the point of destination and by rearward chaining of routing vector information through the simulation network to the point of origin. The Managerial Pyramid Switch Architecture provides a computer network system which plots a purchase order providing the lowest prices and the best terms and conditions available for that transaction at that moment and a request is initiated and continues in real time as the activity progresses.

The Managerial Pyramid Switch Architecture provides such a computer network which minimizes bandwidth usage by performing cleaning standardizing organizing and transforming the raw data from the Spaghetti Phenomena or Legacy System environment so that UCommerce supplier system can analyze and evaluate the best usage network resources to satisfy the needs of the customers in the following manner 

a The HIVE administers coordinates controls mimics manages the live network and also reflects a concurrent and parallel working simulation of the live network call routing activities and transactions.

b The heart of the system is the business intelligence TQM functions that make sure to predict when a customer becomes dissatisfied to immediately avoid churn and also enable the supplier system to bill and manage the follow of money in real time.

c The three clusters of tiers belonging to the managerial hierarchy update their subordinate components by sending only summarized information packets to their organizational subordinates. Consequently these updates facilitate network wide information in real time to each intelligent component so that the decisions are based on facts and not lookup tables or hard coded predefined routing patterns. This is the basis for the development of the two new methods Z PRICE and W RANK.

d The different clusters or switches can avoid bottlenecks within their organization by assigning cost to each activity and limiting the resource. Each Intelligent Component has at its disposal to perform tasks and the ability to find and use available buffer resources by less taxed members of the group and load balances the demand on the organization s resources as per scenarios and business cases with regard to particular situations SNAFU or dire conditions contemplated by management. The system works always at maximal throughput and can only use emergency reserved resources on its own when the fault is serious enough to cause customer dissatisfaction and a human resource has not acted to the problem within the predefined time allocated for a response.

e The HIVE is an open architecture which operates in conjunction with the Legacy System and its associated technologies so that existing equipment is not wasted and the cost of updating is minimized.

g When two or more independent variables exist a plurality of subordinate members can take ownership of a plurality of circuits of a transaction and then send the partial Vector CDR information to the assigned transactional owner so it can gather all of the circuits information and then match merge the billing entity or purchase order.

The HIVE System is derived from a Genesis Engine Supercomputer Architecture that consists of a system built using a particular configuration. To begin the system is constructed from a pair of network links that are parallel clustered to form a Supercomputer which monitors and controls the Internet represented in Fig. X as 1 Inbound messages and 2 Outbound messages from the environment meeting at a junction point in the form of an organization that has external contact with the outside world via the Internet. The Supercomputer is divided into several tiers for a better distribution and efficiency of the workload. The system can be divided by the summit tier or Managerial Pyramid Switch that is a Superset cluster grouping that is parent of all of the components. The middle tier or Synergy Interface Switch is a set cluster grouping that manages and controls all of the middleware activities for the interacting financial institutions retailers suppliers and wholesalers and also helps the parent component to coordinate and manage all of the available resources. Each middle tier manages multiple lower tier Intelligent Components or Team Work Switch that is a subset cluster group. Each group consists of a plurality of nodes or elements that can perform the following 

a Receive and send messages and transactions for all of the activities performed by human resources and end users that interface with the system .

b Update all of the end users that communicate with the system with the latest shipping cost formulas geographical location of retailers suppliers system warehouses wholesalers and product lines from the different manufacturers.

c Match merge the activities of multiple end users with regards to the same supplier to afford the best competitive rate via economy of scale discounts where applicable.

d Have a hierarchical structure that is geospatial in nature and helps facilitate the interaction with the human resources financial transactions and clients demands. Where each HQ is assigned a value from 0 local to 7 global denotes its authority position power and responsibility within the HIVE . For example HQ7 interacts with all of the customers. The HQ7 interacts with the outside world environment preferably with the management of the supplier system in particular via data warehousing and business intelligence software. Whereas a simple HQ0 interacts monitors and controls the activities of one or more end users within a local geographical area. Thus not all of the Intelligent Components are identical even though they have the same intrinsic characteristics and functions.

e Have delegation of command by means of lateral synergy where a subordinate creates a virtual instance of its immediate superior and acts and functions in the same manner as its supervisor including the same delegated authority and responsibility within the hierarchy. For example a network has a major system failure at the regional level and particular Synergy Interface Switch subordinates and their end users are unable to communicate with the rest of the organization to get wholesaler or supplier prices. The least taxed Team Work Switch will behave temporarily as the SIS and will temporary approve verify and validate as a partial transaction a given activity with the maxi cost algorithm as if the entire organization was still visible and fully operational. Once the network communication is restored the TWS notifies its supervisors all of their activities and then each supervisor reviews the activities validated SIS with the mini cost algorithm. Then the SIS makes the appropriate validation of inventory pricing and transportation and rearward chains the missing gaps of information with certitude to its subordinates that will continue interacting amongst themselves until all of the information has been successfully updated and validated.

f The HIVE is the main cluster that is used to give a heart beat to all of the concurrently working nodes of the clusters as is also known as the Superset.

g The summit tier of nodes is commercially known as MPS that monitors all of the activities of the environment and is responsible for training its subordinates of the most effective and efficient manner to present conditions. The system assigns priorities and rations available resources forcing its subordinates to share resources and work together primarily by promoting shunting resources from nodes having larger buffers to process the activity. In a nutshell these nodes control coordinate manage and monitor the Internet or the superset U . The MPS performs the following 

Coordinates the activities of the subscriber software driven requests. ii Analyzes gathers and identifies consumer personal information and purchasing patterns of behavior. iii Allows an organization to have a personalized yet secure interaction with the public. iv Manages end users requests and replies while determining their level of satisfaction with regards to TQM functions. v Communicates with the outside of the environment via the Internet.

h The middle tier of nodes is commercially known as SIS that monitors all of the activities of a given region of the environment and is responsible for training its subordinates of the most effective and efficient manner to present conditions. This tier controls and is responsible for the actual inventory and makes financial decisions using mini cost algorithms. These elements gather information and study patterns of purchasing and production behavior and faults and then make on their own ad hoc optimized logistics reports that are submitted to the managers of the supplier organizations. This inverted or reverse ad hoc query does not hog the resources of the network since the system builds the report on its own by summarizing the reports of its subordinates and then sending them to the user. In a nutshell these nodes control coordinate manage and monitor a geographical region of the Internet or the set where U I J K . The SIS manages and controls the logistical flow of transportation and queuing of delivery of goods and services from an UCommerce warehouse to the destination. The SIS merges multiple end users requests as one to have better bargaining power and lower costs to the consumer via economies of scale.

i The lower tier of nodes is commercially known as TWS that monitors all of the activities of a given partition of the environment such as a geographic area of coverage of a LATA local access and transport area cleans standardizes organizes and transforms the raw data of the environment into a lingua franca. The TWS validates and verifies each end user request and reply and is assigned an ownership of several end users. This tier at incipiency determines the origin tandem and destination of the transaction. By means of the data mining activities of the client software the system updates and keeps the end users profile current. In a nutshell these nodes control coordinate manage and monitor a subset of the Internet by modeling a plurality of retailers suppliers and wholesalers organization points of presence and have the means to interact directly with their provisioning systems.

X FOB method The UCommerce client software uses stored media devices or downloaded compressed file structures with critical data that allows the end user to perform optimized searches. The client will take advantage of lookup tables stored in memory or open files with a product list to determine which products are valid. Then the system opens the data specification files and all of the static data is displayed in the Graphical User Interface GUI . The system subdivides a search and then disseminates the request. The client analyzes the request using the fuzzy logic and then breaks it into several partial commands by suppliers. Each partial request is sent to the supplier system and replied to the client that is responsible for merging and integrating each of the partial commands to a single version of the truth. The system will prioritize each available product based on UCommerce shipment value and overall net price. Once the client gets the updated price it adds the domestic shipment when Inventory is not available. X FOB penalizes the FOB price based on the number of days the product is away from the C F port. X FOB stands for delay free FOB price. X FOB is primarily concerned with the optimal distribution of goods and services from Leg A to UCommerce warehouse Leg T or Leg U using Ocean Land and Cargo transportation services where delivery is preferred in days.

Y CDIF method The software uses stored media devices or downloaded compressed file structures with critical data that allows the client to perform optimized searches. The client will take advantage of lookup tables stored in memory or open files with a product list to determine which products are valid. Then the system opens the data specification files and all of the static data is displayed in the Graphical User Interface GUI . The system subdivides a search and then disseminates the request. The client analyzes the request using the fuzzy logic and then breaks it into several partial commands by suppliers. Each partial request is sent to the supplier system and replied to the client that is responsible for merging and integrating each of the partial commands to a single version of the truth. Once the system has assigned a X FOB price for a given product the end user selects a C F international shipping method via Air White Green Blue Red and or Black Label express mail services. The International shipment charge if any is added to the FOB price per unit. The system then calculates the Air shipment method expressed in hours to further adjust the FOB price International Shipment Value Added Duties. In other words the system will penalize or make more expensive the Y CDIF price of a product due to greater time delay requirements to deliver products to the consumer. Y CDIF stands for delay free CDIF door to door service. Y CDIF is primarily concerned with the optimal distribution of goods and services from Leg A Leg T or Leg U to destination Leg B after paying cargo duties and insurance and using Cargo and Express shipment transportation services where delivery is preferred in hours taking into account cost as constraint. Y CDIF Gold is a rush service when the client requires merchandise ASAP where cost is a secondary constrain and time the primary and immediate service is optimal.

X FOB and Y CDIF are a way to calculate the quality and versatility of a transport route from Leg A to Leg B Warehouse that ranges from optimal a 10 and weakest a 4. Leg A is the origin Leg B is the destination Leg T is an UCommerce warehouse residing in the same continent that Leg A does and Leg U is a UCommerce warehouse residing in the same continent that Leg B does. To determine the value the UCommerce software determines the following 1 merchandise is already in a warehouse Inventory In Hand 2 3 Industrial Basis for Leg A and Industrial Basis for Leg B country by using a lookup table 4 Domestic shipment modifier based on the country 5 Leg A and Leg B are in the same region and 6 Intercontinental modifiers based on Leg A and Leg B continents. X FOB does not calculate inventory in hand where as Y CDIF Gold has priority to the merchandise and is immediately sent.

X FOB Routing Each Intelligent component TWS SIS and MPS determines for each point of presence warehouse the best continental regional warehouse for sending merchandise FOB or C F. The supplier also assigns the best FOB price via X FOB method and then determines the C F destination ports to send goods and services. When making calculations the client uses the geographical UCommerce Warehouse by default. Alternatively the end user can select a different path from the critical path and the system will make the appropriate calculation. The client software will immediately monitor and track the critical path and the end user will define path and warn any time delays and cost differences.

Y CDIF Routing The supplier system determines the best path to send CDF merchandise via Y CDIF method and the end user only has to specify where they want the goods and services delivered. Every time the system detects a significant change in inventory for a given product the system will update all of the clients of the newly derived critical paths for delivering good and services.

X FOB and Y CDIF Restocking After each purchase each TWS SIS and MPS determines how to replenish Inventory In Hand levels and purchase optimal levels of merchandise to maintain the minimum amount of inventory in stock at the lowest cost to the system. X FOB restocks in ocean land or cargo transportation methods whereas Y CDIF uses green blue or red labels. Y CDIF Gold uses red or black labels.

UCommerce Searches The client software must require from the end user a supplier before making a search. Once the end user selects the valid supplier for a given product the system can start the partial search commands that are sent to each TWS SIS and MPS that using X FOB and Y CDIF methods create optimal transportation cost from Leg X to Leg Y. When the supplier system responds from the active memory information of each Intelligent Component the client merges all of the partial commands to a single version of the truth. The Intelligent Component does not make a SQL command request instead of the Intelligent Component has control of the inventory and is responsible for managing and coordinating the flow of information sent to it to be processed by the different clients. Once the information is made to the Intelligent Component it will match merge optimal routes in its entirety or partially until the best satisfying means of delivery are obtained.

UCommerce Pickups The end user can also request the shipping only through the UCommerce method supplier system. The end user delivers at the nearest authorized agents the goods with the original cost so that the system can generate the quote for the duties and expenses at the final destination. Each order confirmation uses an authorized agent that accepts the goods to be shipped in behalf of the client and then sends them to the final destination via C F CDF or CDIF as the client selected.

UCommerce Restocking When making a search for C F CIF CDF and CDIF the system calculates X FOB and Y CDIF until the warehouse has enough Inventory In Hand to satisfy the order. Thus if an end user requested quote demands for a quantity of items that exceeds available Inventory In Hand the system will do the following 1 Requests the missing Inventory via X FOB and Y CDIF restocking means. 2 Then merchandise will receive the appropriate time delay for availability in the system. 3 Ideally the system will request all of the missing merchandise from the manufacturer as one consolidated order since the merchandise will not leave until all of the units are available. 4 All of the FOB quotes from UCommerce Warehouse offer X FOB Inventory In Hand with the corresponding restocking delay. 5 All of the C F CDF and CDIF quotes will offer both X FOB and Y CDIF to the final destination port with the corresponding restocking delay whereas Y CDIF Gold makes available the actual Inventory In Hand with no delay.

X FOB Inventory Control Bitmaps Each TWS SIS and MPS creates a X FOB real time Inventory control tables that allow subordinate Intelligent Components to monitor a specific geographic area to store several bitmaps of information such as 1 Availability 2 Quantity In Hand 3 Highest Quantity 4 Best Price 5 Most Reliable route and 6 transportation means.

Y CDIF Inventory Control Bitmaps Each TWS SIS and MPS creates a Y CDIF real time Inventory control tables that allow subordinate Intelligent Components to monitor a specific geographic area to store several bitmaps of information. The bitmaps consist of 0 and 1 to notify which supplier carries a specific product in the Available field. The In Hand consists of a number of 2 to the n 1 power in hexadecimal form 0 to 32758 products in hand. The highest bitmap is a hexadecimal value that calculates how much inventory a specific supplier has where F means unlimited. The best Price and Most Reliable bitmaps sort with ranking which supplier offers the best service to the end user. These numbers are updated after each change in inventory to reflect the latest optimal prices and paths. These bitmaps have preprocessed all of the mathematical calculations with the best case inventory and logistical flow for a given item using X FOB and Y CDIF guidelines eliminating the need for end users software components to have to do the calculations or bog down the system with unnecessary queries.

Search Engine Supercomputers Several Search Engines exist in the lucrative market of delivering valorized content via the Internet such as Ask Altavista Google MSN and Yahoo to name a few that are based on large scale Supercomputers of thousands of CPU U that are subdivided into groups sets and clusters subsets of 64 specialized nodes or elements that a lightning speed identifies the best satisfying response for a given parameters of regular expressions. Note clusters of 64 nodes distribution tend to be the most cost efficiency arrangement based on the magnitude of the superset UI . These search engines perform millions of daily searches and lion share of the responses occur in less than 0.1 seconds.

XCommerce Is an Inventory Control system similar to UCommerce where the distribution of goods and services is expanded to include electronic links and their corresponding html content. Since the browser entities are a very lucrative endeavor and enjoy long term stream of revenues due in part to the teachings of mass media Target Advertisement from the Berkeley s University professor Dr. Goldhaber. Note this technology will use Optimal Value Advertisement that takes into account economies of scale limited advertisement budgets and mathematical algorithms to maximize customers satisfaction.

Browsers Gather Information The UI or the Internet Universe Superset contains all of the information that is obtained by web crawlers that are programmed to scan predefined subdivision of the chaos and anarchy environment and in return then as geospatial data with balance harmony and proportion so that a cluster of 64 CPU can divide and conquer its content. Each node has 1 n links or content of the Internet. These nodes parse the information with a plurality of regular expressions designed to identify common denominator patterns of alphanumeric characters that are hereinafter referred as KEYWORDS. Each unique IP Address is considered a link that is comprised by a plurality of HTML web pages with content hereinafter referred as PAGES. The cluster using a dictionary of valid Keywords and databases of LINK values helps populate the multi independent variables associated with solving the Eigenvector most satisfying solution based on the known content UI .

Browsers Standardize Information The browsers gather the information from the environment as begin rationalizing and standardizing the raw mountains of meaningless data into the essence of the matter that mathematical explains with quantifiable values what is good bad or redundant. As each HTML is parsed the browser detects Keywords and compares the historical LINK information X Y Z preserved in a Data Warehouse. Then the system uses eigenvectors based on algorithms to normalize quantify and qualify as statistical distribution that permits which discrete group of PAGES I J K or elements of the Superset UI is the most satisfying response to the end user inquiry.

Browsers Organized Information Now that the information has been normalized and standardized the cluster can correlate the data to eliminate bad or incomplete information and through the process of simplification remove the lion share of data which is redundant leaving only exact data that is highly useful and unique. As each link is extracted and valorized for content value of its subordinate PAGES the system places signature values such as I KEYWORD J Frequency K LINGUISTIC WORD PATTERNS X LINK Value Y Reliability and Z Popularity with a mini set or micro universe of the browsers UB limitations to a discrete number of responses n where the cluster cherry picks the discrete sorted by valuing the resultant of the maximized Eigenvector UB with I J K X Y Z characteristics that respond to a simple regular expression inquiry. LINGUISTIC WORD PATTERN valorization method is explained in the new art concerning XCommerce.

Browsers Transform Information As the content of a HTML is converted into Keywords and WORD PATTERNS values all of a sudden the raw meaningless data can be expressed as the primed correlated single version of the truth vector based data with I J K X Y Z independent variables to name a few. Where I J K are the independent variables that analyze the KEYWORD content as it refers to a group of logically organized words used to communicate a message that has been translated into a lingua franca mathematical language that is not confounded. Furthermore possessing X Y Z that independent variables that are used to normalize links within the scope of particular sets that belong to the superset UI that is relational and dimensioned based on quality popularity product and satisfaction patterns of behavior.

Browsers Analyze Information Data Mart means that they reduce complexity and augment Keywords LINGUISTIC WORD PATTERNS and LINKS values.

Browsers Evaluate Information Business Intelligence allowing the human intelligence to better understand the environment as it relates to each customer.

Browsers Identify Customers from Universal to Particular understanding that personalized means of advertisement have a greater significant impact on persuading an individual to satisfy a craving need.

Browsers Target Advertisements paying the bills corporate advertiser must be able to use the Internet as a new method to reach the public that is better than traditional mass media technology.

Browsers Corporate Sponsors Value cost justifying with results a personalized relationship between the corporate sponsors and customers is generated. This bond of trust and confidence facilitates sales.

Rule 1 UCommerce versions I and II always try to minimize delays duties and costs to service the customer with the best product and the door to door service.

Rule 46 The Parser function of each MPS SIS and TWS is responsible for updating gathering analyzing and distilling significant portions of the environment.

Rule 47 The Storager function is responsible for updating normalizing validating and verifying the information into the XLDB Data Mart so the human resources of the organization can use it for business intelligence.

Rule 48 Intelligent Components controlling the activities and inventory of a 3party can create a localized micro order that can control special conditions promotions transportation means and containers with pre sold merchandise that belong to them until sold.

Rule 49 The Partial Leg A is responsible for creating ordering synchronizing and match merging all of the orders in queue into the UCommerce owned Micro Macro Super and Global orders once they are requested and updated until they reach the different points of the trajectory.

Rule 50 The Partial Leg B is responsible for verifying controlling distributing and storing the Micro Macro Super and Global orders that have arrived into a UCommerce warehouse into the appropriate end user Order so that they can dispatch to the final destination.

Rule 51 The system creates purchases based on discretionary events to calculate optimal price bitmap inventory tables known as Z PRICE. The system tries to identify cost reduction at a point of the trajectory from origin to destination and must adhere to known limitations such as transportation flow warehousing and human resources capabilities that quickly create complexity. As shown in other inventions complexity is a geometrically growing cost. The UCommerce supplier system lowers discretionary events frequency once the complexity level exceeds 1 which is the level where Informational Entropy exists absent of a tax burden.

Rule 52 Using the Managerial Pyramid Switch architecture the environment is subdivided into global regional and sector geospatial areas based on Area Codes with an eight hierarchical levels HQ7 to HQ0 organization.

Rule 53 The lower tier consists of a TWS with four hierarchical levels HQ3 to HQ0 that handle all of the Retailer Supplier UCommerce and Wholesaler warehouse organization purchasing and traffic synchronization within sector geospatial areas where each organization based on their complexity is assigned to distinct ownerships such as HQ0 small HQ1 medium HQ2 large organizations and HQ3 UCommerce continental regions or sectors.

Rule 54 The middle tier consists of a SIS with two hierarchical levels HQ5 to HQ4 that handle all of the purchasing and traffic synchronization within a continental region geospatial area.

Rule 56 The system consists of a parallel cluster Supercomputer with artificial intelligence programming that gives a heart beat to each node. The Supercomputer or HIVE consists of a plurality of managerial hierarchical Intelligent Components that possess programming that enables each node to perform complex tasks while the summit tier supervisor assigns coordinates controls prioritizes and synchronizes the logistical flow of information with throughput capacity limitations network latency cost and transactional weighted time intervals to avoid saturation.

Rule 57 The HIVE is considered a superset that is subdivided into subsets sets and elements. The MPS tier manages the superset the SIS tier manages a set the TWS tier manages a subset and specific nodes manage elements such Retailer Supplier UCommerce and Wholesaler organizations.

Rule 58 The superset HQ7 HQ6 global Data Mart controls coordinates manages optimizes and synchronizes the flow and profit for the system s inventory via domain data.

Rule 59 Each set HQ5 HQ4 Extreme Large Database XLDB Data Mart controls coordinates manages optimizes and synchronizes the flow and profit for the system s inventory via regional data.

Rule 60 Each subset HQ3 Very Large Database VLDB Data Mart controls coordinates manages optimizes and synchronizes the flow and profit for the system s inventory via local data.

Rule 61 Each element HQ2 HQ0 controls coordinates manages optimizes and synchronizes the inventory storage and transportation for each participating 3party.

Rule 62 For large multinational distribution means HQ6 and HQ4 will match merge global and regional scope activities.

Rule 63 The system consolidates all of the orders and pre sold and critical inventory levels to make direct purchases to 3parties twice a day. Macro Order Begin is performed at the beginning of the day and Macro Order End appends business day transactions. This rule applies for Micro Super and Global Orders that must harmonize all of the transactions into universal time and take into account different business hours.

Rule 64 The system gathers standardizes organizes and transforms into lingua franca each 3party point of presence where all of the transactions are preferably quoted in USD.

Rule 65 Each order is converted into geospatial vectors where Leg A is the origin Leg B the destination and Leg T and U are transport shipment segments. The system creates a plurality of optimal matrices of Z PRICE inventories based on X FOB and Y CDIF independent variables which mandate that the match merge process of all of the end users and 3party orders is best described in Partial Vectors which have containers time delays transportation and profit methods.

Rule 66 The system profit method is created by each TWS SIS and MPS . The Mini Cost algorithm profit margin is made flexible to encapsulate the maximal amount of inventory with a common P U.

Rule 68 Partial Leg A consists of moving merchandise to an UCommerce warehouse from a plurality of 3party points of presence.

Rule 72 Z PRICE is a bitmap system that enables optimal large scale sales. 1 Where each warehouse has several transportation queues with goods in route 2 the system assigns the discount rates of purchasing large quantities of merchandising and 3 the minimum weight and its associated cost of shipping has to be diluted by maximizing containers capacities.

Rule 73 Z PRICE is made not piecemeal item by item instead the system purchases the inventory by Retailer Supplier UCommerce and Wholesaler using X FOB and Y CDIF means.

Rule 74 Each Order is an independent billing entity that can belong to micro macro super or global orders.

Rule 75 Once an end user selects the merchandise the system match merges to consolidate the demand for merchandise and then utilizes optimal cost P U and most efficient container management.

Rule 76 When using Z PRICE the system considers the merchandise to belong to the end user once it arrives to the final UCommerce warehouse.

Rule 77 Z PRICE can use Inventory in Hand swap or barter similar merchandise amongst micro macro super and global orders to optimize traffic.

Rule 78 Common denominator shipments originating from a plurality of 3parties to an UCommerce warehouse are linked together to a given delay interval and associated to the appropriate Partial Leg A Vectors.

Rule 79 Common denominator shipments originating from an UCommerce warehouse to be distributed to a plurality of end users door to door are linked together to a given delay interval and associated to the appropriate Partial Leg B Vectors.

Rule 80 Z PRICE method possesses algorithms that are programmed to generate multi dimensional bitmaps that deplete optimally available inventories in 3parties.

Rule 81 End users purchasing with the Z PRICE receive an estimated P U Quote that using business intelligence calculates with probability the final prorated cost.

Rule 82 End users receive a better P U at the cost sacrificing an optimally available direct purchase.

Rule 83 Each UCommerce warehouse can purchase merchandise for Inventory In Hand to maximize containers using Business Intelligence purchase patterns that predict future purchase streams of multi time intervals and transportation methods.

Rule 84 Electronic Files Internet links and the associated HTML content can be standardized organized and transformed into geospatial information that can be valorized using Z PRICE like bitmaps known as W RANK.

Rule 85 W RANK uses eigenvectors to identify the value of each link and its content and the supplier system must normalize this information into a compatible Partial Vector CDR method that is based on Partial Differential Equations. The lion share of the conversion and normalization is done by the specialized programming of the HIVE commercially known as the LATIN which gathers distills and analyzes the spaghetti of the environment by mapping standardizing organizing and transforming the information into logical groups and sets to make them compatible.

Rule 86 Each node belonging to the supplier system HIVE will receive the additional programming and functionalities to process in parallel UCommerce and XCommerce methods.

Rule 87 A Quote Search and Browser Search query responses are considered transactional objects derived from end users with a discrete amount of items that the system must optimally satisfy.

Rule 88 The end users content to the Internet and obtain information from the web host Supercomputer via a proprietary interface that creates requests based on mathematical valorized methods using regular expression parameters to obtain content.

Rule 90 A sub cluster is composed of a plurality of nodes that possess programming means to search find identify and valorize its subset of the domain.

Rule 91 A master node for each sub cluster match merges the responses of its subordinates based on synergistic proprietary intellectual property guidelines.

Rule 92 The web host Supercomputer must integrate Browser Engine Shopping Cart Advertisement means and Business Intelligence to identify what satisfies the consumer.

Rule 93 The web host Supercomputer brings law and order to the chaos and anarchy of the Internet. The Internet is considered a 4generation Telecommunications network of 2 000 000 000 subscribers and an independent geospatial superset.

Rule 94 Browser Engine E Shopping Cart S Advertisement means A Billing B and Business Intelligence I are considered informational functions of the superset.

Rule 95 The superset consists of thousands of nodes that are distributed into sets of parallel working clusters possessing the A B E I S informational functions that are physically and often geographically separated for redundancy and greater fault tolerance.

Rule 96 Each set is further partitioned into subsets possessing a plurality of sub clusters ideally and for simplicity to this document of a configuration of 8 by 8 or 64 nodes.

Rule 97 Each node is an element belonging to a superset set subset and sub cluster or group configuration.

Rule 98 XCommerce uses W RANK the environmental bitmap of optimal inventory that measures the Internet content based on quality quantity reliability and security values. The Internet is considered a Superset U that can consist of a plurality of sets subsets groups and basic elements.

Rule 100 Each page consists of a plurality of valid words that are used to measure the value of each page in the Internet.

Rule 101 End users can use a valid word or Keyword to make a broad search of the content of the Internet that has the same characteristics of an Order.

Rule 102 Advanced Keyword Searches consist of associating valid words and operands to form a group set that has the same characteristics of a Micro Order.

Rule 103 Each cluster has a hash table for the most valuable results of a Keyword Search in addition the hash table contains the pointer address of location within the compressed files possessing the content of the Internet. The hash table contains information of the domain of each node.

Rule 104 The Master node possesses a hash table for the entire Internet that helps derive the filtering parameters to instantiate a query response.

Rule 105 The system uses Eigenvectors to quantify and qualify with mathematical formulas Advanced Keyword Searches so the system can derive an optimal discrete query response. The Master node match merges the response of each node and then correlates into a single list.

Rule 106 The first Keyword is considered primary the second one secondary the third one tertiary and so forth. A primary Keyword has a higher weighted value than a secondary one and so forth.

Rule 107 The system match merges an Advanced Keyword Search or a Regular Expression instantiates the equivalent of a Micro Order container.

Rule 108 The system categories the magnitude of each Keyword from 0 to 15 where 0 is vague expressed in billions of responses and 15 unique.

Rule 109 The system for each Keyword creates three structures Simple Hybrid and Complex Pyramids that gather distill analyze organize and transform the content into geospatial bitmap data.

Rule 110 A Simple Pyramid search consists of a container that possesses the equivalent of exactly 1 000 000 optimal query responses that resemble a resultant Macro Order after match merging a plurality of Partial Vector Set Searches.

Rule 111 A Hybrid Pyramid search consists of a container that possesses the equivalent of exactly 10 000 optimal query responses that resemble a resultant Super Order after match merging a plurality of Partial Vector Set Searches.

Rule 112 A Complex Pyramid search consists of a container that possesses the equivalent of exactly 100 optimal query responses that resemble a resultant Global Order after match merging a plurality of Partial Vector Set Searches.

Rule 113 A plurality of Advanced Keyword Searches uses magnitude 0 to 6 words to derive the most valuable weighted 1 000 000 query responses that make up a Simple Pyramid search with a relative weighted magnitude of 7.

Rule 114 A plurality of Simple Pyramid structure searches and Keywords of magnitude 6 to 9 are used to derive the most valuable weighted 10 000 query responses that make up a Hybrid Pyramid search with a relative weighted magnitude of 11.

Rule 115 A plurality of Hybrid Pyramid structure searches and Keywords of magnitude 10 to 13 are used to derive the most valuable weighted 100 query responses that make up a Complex Pyramid search with a relative weighted magnitude of 15.

Rule 117 A valid word with a magnitude of 2 or more is considered a Keyword. Thus a set of characters and their associated magnitudes help define the process of converting it into geospatial bitmap data.

Rule 121 When the end user makes a single word request for a Keyword Search with a word with a magnitude of 0 1 2 the system at random replaces the search with a magnitude 5 Keyword.

Rule 134 The process of converting a simple Keyword into a Pyramid Search structure is the process of transforming raw confounded and worthless information into primed standardized geospatial bitmap data. W RANK method takes into account the human capacity to measure and understand quality for discrete quantities such 10 to 100 responses.

Rule 135 A Keyword that is transformed into geospatial bitmap data will possess a higher magnitude value. W RANK method takes into account the human nature that considers time as money whereas it can be amusing to have a query response with millions responses they don t want to have to distill analyze and find on their own the most valuable answer.

Rule 136 The system reads the entire content of the Superset U and determines for each link the valid languages such as English French Germany or Spanish to name a few. The algorithm then determines the language of each page belonging to a link.

Rule 138 A Keyword is compared against a language identifier dictionary and also to corporate technological and mathematical geospatial libraries.

Rule 140 The system uses Keyword Validation filtering that distills the words inside each Page based on magnitude 0 to 6 Keywords or Simple Pyramid Structure 1 Joins 2 Blocks 3 Walls and 4 Ceilings. The weighted algorithm ranks the content of the document versus a given language standard from 0 to 10000.

Rule 141 Pages that have a value less than the language limit are not considered to belong to that language.

Rule 142 Pages that have a value greater than the language limit and below the language structural limit are confounded. 0 Pages are eliminated from the process.

Rule 143 The system reads the content of a Page to derive basic linguistic and geospatial characteristics.

Rule 144 The system performs a Keyword Value filtering that distills the words inside each Page based on magnitude 7 to 10 Keywords or Hybrid Pyramid Structure 1 Joins 2 Blocks 3 Walls and 4 Ceilings.

Rule 145 The system performs a Keyword Quality filtering that distills the words inside each Page based on magnitude 11 to 14 Keywords or Complex Pyramid Structure 1 Joins 2 Blocks 3 Walls and 4 Ceilings.

Rule 146 The Keyword Value and Keyword Quality filtering algorithms results are converted into environmental bitmap data from the point of view of a subset U where the common denominator element is the primary Keyword.

Rule 147 The Keyword Validation mechanism identifies if the data belongs to a language and if it is valid or invalid.

A Macro Order permits the supplier system to have the capacity to partially match merge the contents of several distinct orders belonging to a plurality of end users to take advantage of economies of scale.

Let s suppose that a given product such as HD TV is sold in massive scale 20 000 units per day and its supplier is located in Japan. For the purchase of a single HD TV the P U X FOB TYO is 699 and P U Y CDIF is 999 699 FOB TYO 100 Shipping TYO MIA via Ocean 150 customs 50 UCommerce Shipping and Handling with delivery in 4 weeks.

Buying in bulk 20 000 units the supplier X FOB price to UCommerce TYO is 549 or 699 minus 20 discount 

The product weight is 20 . Thus the UCommerce by purchasing in behalf of the 20 000 end users with common denominator Leg A TYO and Leg T Miami can create two Macro Orders that offer optimal P U to the end users 

1 Macro Order Leg A has a X FOB Price UCommerce TYO of 549 significantly reducing the cost to the end user by 150.

d BLUE LABEL P U 734 549 FOB TYO 140 Cargo 115 customs 35 UCommerce S H with delivery in 4 to 5 days.

Thus the end users significantly lower their aggregate cost of FOB or CDIF costs and with optional shorter time delays and improved services GOLD LABEL if required.

Z PRICE permits an end user the best price door to door. For example an end user living in Sao Paolo Brazil wants to purchase a single HD TV. If the end user purchases a single item via direct method the cost would be P U X FOB TYO 699 P U X FOB MIA 949 and P U Y CDIF SAO 1 249. Instead the end user allows each UCommerce system and method to find the best price based on time delays 

1 Macro Order Leg A has a X FOB Price UCommerce TYO of 549 significantly reducing the cost to the end user by 150.

Note c g X FOB Y CDIF pricing has already taken into account 115 for customs declarations since the merchandise is handled via Free Trade Zones.

Classical Divide and Conquer Browser Search is a description of how to use the present 3party prior art to derive an optimal query response.

For example an end user wants to find out the World Cup Final match between France and Italy in Germany Jul. 9 2006 

1 Let s assume the end user did not go directly to a favorite sports site that has previously stored in his browser.

5 Note 2 4 the browser will suggest the use www.fifa.com still the end user must find the information within easy during the tournament not 6 months after the fact when League Tournaments Olympic Women World Cup soccer event dominate the spotlight.

6 The Simple Pyramid Structure validates and filters out WORLD CUP FIFA 16 000 000 responses minus 90 redundancy or pork equals 1 600 000 responses still the end user is not satisfied since over a million responses exist or is not impressed using 1 www.favoritesite.com or 5 www.fifa.com using the KEYWORD regular expression WORLD CUP FIFA and English language only.

9 The end user requests the KEYWORD CHAMPION that has 500 000 responses. Fact Italy is the FIFA Germany 2006 World CUP Champion. This logically eliminates the need to use France since they are runners up and any news making reference to the final in future tense.

10 The Hybrid Pyramid Structure validates and filters out GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION 500 000 responses minus 50 redundancy or pork equals 250 000 responses.

13 The end user requests the KEYWORD PENALTY that has 25 000 responses. Fact Z. Z. was given a red card and ejected from the game he was also awarded the Golden Ball award for being the best tournament player and his team France lost the final in penalty kicks.

14 The Hybrid Pyramid Structure that validates and filters out RED GOLDEN PENALTY 25 000 responses minus 50 redundancy or pork equals 12 500 responses.

The XCommerce supplier system is responsible for creating the Informational Pyramid Structures for FIFA content which includes the World Cup and League Tournaments.

Germany is a Join with magnitude 1 and is a country and geospatial. Italy is a Join with magnitude 1 and is a country and geospatial.

World and Cup regular expression have a magnitude 0 or 1 and thus are not considered Keywords whereas FIFA with a magnitude 2 is.

WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION have a magnitude of 7. WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION RED have a magnitude of 8.

Thus using the player collection for example Diego Armando Maradona can be associated as a player that played for Boca Juniors Argentina Barcelona Spain and Napoli Italy.

In particular Zidane can be associated as a player that played for Bordeaux in France Juventus in Italy and Real Madrid in Spain.

WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION RED GOLD PENALTY ZIDANE BUFFON CANNAVARO SHAKIRA have a magnitude of 15.

The End user begins the Divide and Conquer process of placing enough words until the Browser Engine responds with a satisfying response.

The Simple Pyramid Structure for WORLD CUP FIFA is a process that logically associates other valuable common denominator KEYWORDS to derive to the optimal element.

2 The System uses Simple Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings English Semantics to further valorize each of the links and to associate them to belong to one cell. Thus the 1 000 000 cells have the 2.5 billion responses.

Note 2 to 9 consists of a preprocessed task done to all of the pages of the Internet having a given language content in this case English.

The Intermediate Keyword search WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION versus the Hybrid Pyramid Structure.

The End user begins the Divide and Conquer process of placing enough words until the Browser Engine responds with a satisfying response.

The Hybrid Pyramid Structure for WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION is a process that logically associates other valuable common denominator KEYWORDS to derive to the optimal element.

7 The System uses Hybrid Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings English Semantics by paragraph to further valorize each of the links and then associate them to belong to one cell. Thus the 10 000 cells have the 2.5 billion responses.

The pages that the system measured having a weighted value 500 000 such as WORLD CUP FIFA or WORLD CUP FIFA are valid.

As per Examples 3 and 4 only CHAMPION is a KEYWORD. For the second filter the Primary word is GERMANY. Secondary word is ITALY. Tertiary word is CHAMPION.

A discrete test is based on the unique number of words in a given page. The system match merges common denominator 1 to 256 Hybrid Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings out of the most likely 1024 comparisons.

8 The System uses Complex Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings Data and Geospatial data by content to further valorize each of the links and then associate them to belong to one cell. Thus the 100 cells have the 2.5 billion responses.

9 The pages that the system measured having a weighted value 3 000 000 such as WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION or HYBRID or HYBRID PYRAMID combinations are valid.

As per Examples 3 and 4 none are KEYWORDS. For the third filter the Primary word is RED. Secondary word is GOLD. Tertiary word is PENALTY.

A discrete test is based on the unique number of words in a given page. The system match merges common denominator 1 to 256 Complex Joins Blocks Walls and Ceilings out of the most likely 1024 comparisons.

10 Finally after the system has match merged the Complex Pyramid Switch the system identifies the highest satisfying KEYWORD to further valorize each of the links and then associate them to belong to the TOP ten cell. Thus the 11 cells have the 2.5 billion responses.

The pages that the system measured having a weighted value 10 000 000 such as WORLD CUP FIFA GERMANY ITALY CHAMPION RED GOLD PENALTY or COMPLEX or COMPLEX PYRAMID combinations are valid.

When the end user makes a request such as WORLD CUP FIFA the query requires the 8 8 cluster to perform an eigenvector search to derive the highest valued replies to the end user.

Whereas W RANK identifies the HQ1 owner of the FIFA KEYWORD Environmental Bitmap Pyramid Structure for the result without performing any calculations since the data within the supplier system is current.

Finally W RANK uses a weighted algorithm instead a Regular Expression filtering mechanism or Caesar s Divide and Conquer strategy as shown in the Examples 3 to 5.
