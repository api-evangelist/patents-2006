This invention was developed under Contract ECS 0348582 between the Georgia Institute of Technology and the National Science Foundation. The U.S. Government may have certain rights to this invention.

The subject matter of this application relates to probe microscopy. More particularly the subject matter of this application relates to methods and devices for probe and force microscopes with sensors having improved sensitivity.

Conventional atomic force microscope AFM and its variations have been used to probe a wide range of physical and biological processes including mechanical properties of single molecules electric and magnetic fields of single atoms and electrons. Moreover cantilever based structures inspired by the AFM have been a significant driver for nanotechnology resulting in chemical sensor arrays various forms of lithography tools with high resolution and terabit level data storage systems. Despite the current rate of success the AFM needs to be improved in terms of speed sensitivity and an ability to generate quantitative data on the chemical and mechanical properties of the sample. For example when measuring molecular dynamics at room temperature the molecular forces need to be measured in a time scale that is less than the time of the thermal fluctuations to break the bonds. This requires a high speed system with sub nanonewton and sub nanometer sensitivity.

Current cantilever based structures for AFM probes and their respective actuation methodologies lack speed and sensitivity and have hindered progress in the aforementioned areas. Imaging systems based on small cantilevers have been developed to increase the speed of AFMs but this approach has not yet found wide use due to demanding constraints on optical detection and bulky actuators. Several methods have been developed for quantitative elasticity measurements but the trade off between force resolution measurement speed and cantilever stiffness has been problematic especially for samples with high compliance and high adhesion. Cantilever deflection signals measured during tapping mode imaging have been inverted to obtain elasticity information with smaller impact forces but complicated dynamic response of the cantilever increases the noise level and prevents calculation of the interaction forces. Arrays of AFM cantilevers with integrated piezoelectric actuators have been developed for parallel lithography but low cantilever speed and complex fabrication methods have limited their use.

Most of the scanning probe microscopy techniques including tapping mode imaging and force spectroscopy rely on measurement of the deflection of a microcantilever with a sharp tip. Therefore the resulting force data depend on the dynamic properties of the cantilever which shapes the frequency response. This can be quite limiting as mechanical structures like cantilevers are resonant vibrating structures and they provide information mostly only around these resonances. For example in tapping mode imaging it is nearly impossible to recover all the information about the tip sample interaction force since the transient force applied at each tap cannot be observed as a clean time signal.

Moreover conventional methods of imaging with scanning probes can be time consuming while others are often destructive because they require static tip sample contact. Dynamic operation of AFM such as the tapping mode eliminates shear forces during the scan. However the only free variable in this mode the phase is related to the energy dissipation and it is difficult to interpret. Further the inverse problem of gathering the time domain interaction forces from the tapping signal is not easily solvable due to complex dynamics of the AFM cantilever. Harmonic imaging is useful to analyze the sample elastic properties but this method recovers only a small part of the tip sample interaction force frequency spectrum.

Other problems associated with conventional AFM systems revolve around the systems cantilever and tip. Typical AFM tips consist of a micromachined silicon shard attached to the end of a cantilever or silicon or silicon nitride structures with a sharp edge fabricated as an integral part of the cantilever. These tips are difficult to make and break easily. Therefore the cantilevers have a limited useful lifetime requiring the user to frequently replace them. In addition to being fragile the cantilevers are difficult to properly align in an AFM system. Shape and curvature differences among the cantilevers caused by non uniformities in material properties or fabrication conditions also require the optical systems to be realigned every time a new cantilever is used. In many cases a system of lasers and mirrors are used to properly guide and precisely align the tip. This process is time consuming and imprecise.

Thus there is a need to overcome these and other problems of the prior art associated with probe microscopy.

According to various embodiments there is a force sensor for use in for example probe based instruments such as probe microscopy and structure manipulation. The force sensor can comprises a detection surface a flexible mechanical structure and a gap between the detection surface and the flexible mechanical structure. The force sensors can also comprise a tip in contact with the flexible mechanical structure.

Force sensors described herein can eliminate the corruption of utility such as measurement information that can arise from a cantilever. These force sensors can also be used as actuators to apply known forces providing clean and valuable elasticity information data on surfaces biomolecules and other materials. Moreover these force sensors can be integrated on cantilevers and can be compatible with existing AFM systems while providing accurate tip displacement and also act as active tips .

According to various embodiments a displacement measurement can be made using a flexible mechanical structure such as a membrane a diaphragm a cantilever a clamped clamped beam a flexible structure comprising multiple flexible elements partially or totally fixed at one end on a substantially rigid surface and connected at a point so as to form a symmetry axis. These flexible mechanical structures can be micro machined. These flexible mechanical structures can have uniform or non uniform cross sections to achieve desired static and dynamic deflection characteristics. For example the vibration modes that are symmetric and anti symmetric with respect to the symmetry axis can be used to detect forces in different directions. These flexible mechanical structures can be made of metals such as gold aluminum or a semiconductor such as single crystal silicon or polycrystalline silicon or dielectric materials such as silicon nitride silicon oxide or a polymer such as SU 8 or they can be a composite structure of metallic semiconducting polymer or dielectric materials. While not intending to be so limited measurements can be made to detect for example localized forces such as a force experienced by a tip contacting the flexible mechanical structure surface topography using for example a flexible mechanical structure with an integrated tip contacting a surface a flexible mechanical structure with an integrated tip in close proximity of a surface or substance and forces between a reactive substance such as a molecule bound to the flexible mechanical structure and another reactive substance such as a molecule bound on a close by structure such as a tip.

According to various embodiments the detection surface can be a surface of a rigid substrate or a part of a rigid substrate with an optically reflective diffraction grating a part of a rigid substrate with a reflective and or electrically conductive diffraction grating for optical interferometric detection and electrostatic actuation a part of a rigid substrate with electrically conductive members for electrostatic actuation and capacitive detection a surface of a rigid substrate with a semi transparent layer for optical interferometry. In some cases the detection surface can be a surface of a deformable mechanical structure such as a membrane clamped clamped beam or a cantilever. The rigidity of the mechanical structure with the detection surface can be substantially higher than the flexible mechanical structure of the force sensor. The detection surface can contain conductive and dielectric portions to have electrical isolation between actuation and detection electrodes. In some cases the deformable detection surface can be actuated and therefore it can contain a separate electrode or piezoelectric film for actuation purposes. Still further in some cases the detection surface can form a substrate.

According to various embodiments displacement can be measured using interferometric techniques or capacitive techniques. For example a grating such as that used in a diffraction based optical interferometric method or any other optical interferometric method such as for example Fabry Perot structures an example of which is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 704 932 filed Nov. 10 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety can be used. Capacitive measurements can use techniques used to monitor capacitence such as that used in capacitive microphones.

The flexible mechanical structure dimensions and materials can be adjusted to have desired compliance and measurement capabilities to make static and dynamic measurements with sufficient bandwidth. The overall shape of the flexible mechanical structure can be circular square or any other suitable shape. Typical lateral dimensions can be from 10 m to 2 mm flexible mechanical structure thickness can be from 10 nm to 3 m and the gap can be from 1 nm to 10 m. In some embodiments the gap can be as large as 1 mm. The flexible mechanical structure material can comprise for example aluminum gold silicon nitride silicon silicon oxide or polysilicon or can be a composite structure of metallic semiconducting and dielectric materials. The gap can be sealed or partially sealed for applications in liquids or it can be open for vacuum and atmospheric measurements.

For some force measurements a soft cantilever may not be required. Using the output from the force sensors in a feedback loop one can use an external actuator to individually adjust the tip flexible mechanical structure tip sample distances. According to various embodiments the flexible mechanical structure can be electrostatically actuated to apply desired forces. According to various embodiments force sensors described herein can be attached to a cantilever to form a force sensor structure. Further the force sensor structure can be combined with a detector to form a force sensor unit that can be used in a probe based instrument.

The detection surface can be made of a material transparent to predetermined wavelengths of light. For example the detection surface can be made from silicon oxide such as quartz. The overall shape of the flexible mechanical structure can be circular square or any other suitable shape. Typical diameters of flexible mechanical structure can range from 5 m to 2 mm and the thickness of flexible mechanical structure can be from 10 nm to 10 m. The flexible mechanical structure can be a micro machined material that can comprise for example aluminum gold silicon nitride silicon oxide or polysilicon.

According to various embodiments the distance D of gap can be from 50 nm to 50 m. Moreover the gap can be sealed for applications in liquids or it can be open for vacuum and atmospheric measurements. In some embodiments the gap can be formed by the flexible mechanical structure can be supported over the detection surface by at least one sidewall. Movement of the flexible mechanical structure or displacement measurements can be made for example using a grating as described below that uses a diffraction based optical interferometric method or any other optical interferometric method or a capacitive method such as in that used in capacitive microphones can be used for detection. According to various embodiments grating periods of the grating can range from about 0.5 m to about 20 m. The incident light can be from the UV with wavelengths starting at about 0.2 m to IR with wavelengths starting at about 1.5 m .

According to various embodiments the force sensor can also include a grating as shown in . In a beam of light can be directed through the detection surface to impinge on the flexible mechanical structure and the grating . According to various embodiments the beam of light can be directed at the detection surface at an angle such as in the range of for example 10 away from normal to the detection surface . A portion of the flexible mechanical structure can be reflective such that light can be reflected from the flexible mechanical structure and another portion can be reflected by the grating . As a result different diffraction orders with different intensity levels can be generated as the light passes through the grating depending on the gap thickness.

For example shows first diffraction order light reflected from the grating and the flexible mechanical structure . The diffracted light can be detected by a detector . It is to be understood that alternatively the detectors can be used to detect changes in capacitance due to changes in the gap .

As shown in a stimuli such as a force can be applied to the flexible mechanical structure . The stimuli causes the flexible mechanical structure to bend or flex shown as . According to various embodiments the flexible mechanical structure can bend in various directions such as toward the detection surface or away from the detection surface . Bending the flexible mechanical structure causes the thickness D of the gap shown in to change.

When using a beam of light the light is reflected in a different direction when the flexible mechanical structure is in the bent position than when the flexible mechanical structure is in the rest position . Further light reflected from the bent flexible mechanical structure interacts differently with the grating to produce changes in the intensity of different diffraction orders shown in as . The detectors can then detect the intensity of the diffracted light output from the grating . This provides a robust micro scale interferometer structure. Generally information obtained from the detectors can be used to determine the stimuli such as the amount of force applied to the flexible mechanical structure . This determination can be done using a computer processor not shown or other various techniques as will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Also shown in is a top electrode that can cooperate with for example grating to serve as an actuator as will be described in detail below.

According to various embodiments the detector can be a photo detector such as a silicon photodiode operated in photovoltaic or reverse biased mode or another type of photo detector sensitive in the wavelength range of the light source. Moreover the light can be a coherent light source such as a laser. Exemplary light sources can include but are not limited to helium neon type gas lasers semiconductor laser diodes vertical cavity surface emitting lasers light emitting diodes.

Generally the force sensor can be used to manipulate structures such as atoms molecules or microelectromechanical systems MEMs or to characterize various material properties of a sample . For example the topography of the sample can be determined by moving the sample in a lateral direction across the tip . It is also contemplated that the sample can remain stationary and the tip can be moved relative to the sample . Changes in height of the sample are detected and cause the tip to move accordingly. The force on the tip caused by for example the tip motion can cause the flexible mechanical structure to bend or flex as shown by . Light can also be directed through detection surface to impinge on the flexible mechanical structure . The light is reflected from the flexible mechanical structure and diffracted by the grating . As the tip applies force to the flexible mechanical structure the thickness of the gap changes. This can cause the reflected light to diffract differently than if the flexible mechanical structure were in its un bent position. Thus different diffraction orders intensity can change depending on the gap thickness.

After passing through the grating the diffracted light can be detected by the detectors . The output from the flexible mechanical structure can be used in a feedback loop to direct an external actuator not shown to adjust the tip flexible mechanical structure distance i.e. the gap thickness and thus the tip sample distance d . The flexible mechanical structure can be electrostatically actuated to apply desired forces or to adjust the tip flexible mechanical structure distance i.e. the gap thickness and thus the tip sample distance d by biasing electrodes and attached to the grating and the top electrode respectively. Although two detectors are shown in one of ordinary skill in the art understands that one or more detectors can be used.

According to various embodiments the force sensor can form an integrated phase sensitive diffraction grating structure that can measure the flexible mechanical structure and or tip displacement with the sensitivity of a Michelson interferometer. The displacement of the tip due to stimuli acting on it can be monitored by illuminating the diffraction grating through the transparent detection surface with a coherent light source and the intensity of the reflected diffraction orders can be recorded by the detectors at fixed locations. The resulting interference curve is typically periodic with 2 where is the optical wavelength in air. According to an exemplary embodiment the displacement detection can be within the range of about 4 167.5 nm for 670 nm in the case of a fixed grating . However the detection surface and the grating can be moved by suitable actuators to extend this imaging range. Furthermore the grating can be located not at the center but closer to the clamped edges of the flexible mechanical structure to increase the equivalent detectable tip motion range. In the case of a microscope the active tip can be moved by electrostatic forces applied to the flexible mechanical structure using the diffraction grating as an integrated rigid actuator electrode. In some applications this actuator can be used to adjust the tip position for optimal displacement sensitivity to provide a force feedback signal to an external actuator moving the transparent detection surface .

In some embodiments such as applications requiring high speeds this integrated actuator can be used as the only actuator in the feedback loop to move the tip with a speed determined by the flexible mechanical structure dynamics both in liquids and in air.

According to various embodiments the force sensor can have a compact integrated electrostatic actuator where the electric field between the grating electrode and the top electrode is contained within the gap . This structure can be replicated to form planar arrays of sensors as described in more detail below with good electrical and mechanical isolation. With a suitable set of flexible mechanical structure and electrode materials the device can be operated in a dielectric or conductive fluid. According to various embodiments the electrostatic forces may act only on the probe flexible mechanical structure . As such the actuation speed can be quite fast. Therefore combined with array operations the force sensor can be used in probe applications that call for high speeds.

The force sensors can be used to characterize various material properties of the reactive substance. For example biomolecular bonding can be determined by moving the tip contacted by a reactive substance including for example inorganic molecules and or organic molecules such as biomolecules over the force sensors . It is also contemplated that the tip can remain stationary and the force sensors can be moved relative to the tip . The reactive substance on the flexible mechanical structure can be attracted to the reactive substance on the tip . A stimuli such as a force light or temperature on for example the force sensor or the tip caused by for example the molecular attraction a light source or a temperature source can cause the flexible mechanical structure to bend or flex as shown by . Light can also be directed through detection surface to impinge on the flexible mechanical structure. The light is reflected from the flexible mechanical structure and then diffracted by the grating . As the stimuli displaces the flexible mechanical structure the thickness of the gap changes. This can cause the reflected light to diffract differently than if the flexible mechanical structure were in its un bent position. Thus different diffraction order intensities can be generated as the light passes through the grating depending on the gap thickness. After passing through the grating the diffracted light can be detected by the detectors . The output from the flexible mechanical structure can be used in a feedback loop to direct an external actuator not shown to adjust the tip flexible mechanical structure distance i.e. the gap thickness and thus the tip sample distance d . According to various embodiments the flexible mechanical structure can be electrostatically actuated to apply desired forces by biasing electrodes and attached to the grating and the top electrode respectively.

By using a variety of techniques disclosed herein displacements from 1 mm down to 1 10 Hz or lower can be measured. As such forces from 1N down to 1 pN can be detected with 10 kHz bandwidth With an effective spring constant of the sensor flexible mechanical structure from about 0.001N m to about 1000N m at its softest point. These mechanical parameters can be achieved by micro machined flexible mechanical structures such as MEMs microphone flexible mechanical structures. Therefore using flexible mechanical structure surfaces and tips functionalized by interacting reactive substances as shown in force spectroscopy measurements can be performed in parallel using optical or electrostatic readout.

For example in the case of rupture force measurements the reactive substance such as a molecule is pulled and if the bond is intact the flexible mechanical structure is also pulled out while the displacement i.e. applied force is measured. With the bond rupture the flexible mechanical structure comes back to rest position. The force sensor flexible mechanical structures can be individually actuated to apply pulling forces to individual molecules and measuring their extensions allowing for array operation.

The cantilever can be used to provide periodic tapping impact force for tapping mode imaging to apply controlled forces for contact mode or molecular pulling experiments. Because the flexible mechanical structure can be stiffer than the cantilever and can be damped by immersion in a liquid the measurement bandwidth can be much larger than the cantilever . Furthermore optical readout of the diffraction orders can directly provide tip displacement because the diffraction orders can be generated by the grating under the flexible mechanical structure .

According to various embodiments the reflector can be used to beam bounce to find cantilever deflection for feedback if needed. In some cases the tip force sensor output can provide the real force feedback signal. The cantilever and the flexible mechanical structure dimensions can be adjusted for the measurement speed and force requirements.

Using electrically isolated electrodes the flexible mechanical structure can be actuated so as to have an active tip . Further the actuated flexible mechanical structure can optimize the optical detection or capacitive detection sensitivity in air or in liquid environments. shows an application of a force sensor structure comprising a sensor on a cantilever where the tip is active as shown by arrow . In the active tip can be used to apply known forces to the surface of sample using electrostatic actuation and optical interferometric displacement detection or capacitive displacement detection can be achieved. The tip can be activated for example by applying a bias between the grating and the top electrode . Further a DC force shown by arrow can be used to keep the tip in constant contact with the sample.

Light can be directed to the flexible mechanical structure and the orders of light diffracted by the grating can be detected by the detector . Similar to the force sensor shown in designing the dimensions of the flexible mechanical structure base or choosing the operation frequency at an anti resonance of the cantilever the flexible mechanical structure can be moved and hence the tip can be pushed into the sample by known electrostatic forces. Accordingly displacements of the flexible mechanical structure can be measured optically or capacitively. Furthermore in some embodiments there is no need for an active tip on the force sensor. Moreover for optical measurements the gap between the flexible mechanical structure and the grating can be optimized during fabrication of the force sensor. Thus there is no need to actively adjust that gap during tapping mode operation as shown in . Similarly for capacitive detection an electrical connection for detection of capacitance changes can be provided. In that case the force sensor can be connected to a detection circuit such as used in a capacitive microphone for measuring the force on the tip .

The thickness of the base or the substrate supporting the flexible mechanical structure can be adjusted to control the operation frequency to insure that the motion of the flexible mechanical structure produces an indentation in the sample surface. This measurement therefore provides surface elasticity information directly. According to various embodiments the frequency of electrostatic actuation can be in the ultrasonic range. Alternatively a wideband impulse force can be applied and resulting displacements can be detected in the bandwidth of the flexible mechanical structure displacement force sensor. For these applications it may be desirable to move the higher cantilever vibration mode frequencies away from the first resonance. This can be achieved for example by increasing the mass close to the tip of the cantilever such as by adjusting the thickness or mass of the base . With added mass the cantilever acts more like a single mode mass spring system and can generate tapping signals without spurious vibrations and can also be effective at a broad range of frequencies.

In general for tapping mode AFM and UAFM applications a broadband stiff tip displacement measurement sensor structure can be integrated into compliant structures such as regular AFM cantilevers. Although flexible mechanical structures are primarily described here according to another embodiment the tip displacement measurement structure can be a stiff beam structure with the same cross section of the flexible mechanical structure or another stiff cantilever as shown for example in . In there is a force sensor structure comprising a force sensor a compliant structure a tip and a flexible mechanical structure such as a stiff broadband structure. In this case the stiff broadband structure can be small cantilever mounted to an end of the compliant structure also a cantilever. The small cantilever can be spaced a distance d from the compliant structure . The compliant structure can be used to control the impact and or contact force of the tip mounted to a side of the stiff broadband structure . Further the stiff broadband structure can be used to measure tip displacements. Displacement of the tip can be measured for example optically electrostatically capacitively piezoelectrically or piezoresistively.

According to various embodiments for fast imaging and tapping mode applications the cantilever can be eliminated. In this case a fast x y scan of a sample or the integrated tip can be used with the described sensor actuator for tapping and detecting forces. The large fast z axis motion can be generated for example by a piezoelectric actuator that moves the base of the force sensor which can be a thick rigid substrate.

The sensitivity of a force sensor in accordance with the present teachings can be described by the following exemplary embodiment depicted in . In a rectangular silicon AFM cantilever with a tip is vibrated at 57 kHz above a 150 m diameter 1 m thick aluminum flexible mechanical structure with an integrated diffraction grating . The force sensor flexible mechanical structure is built on a quartz detection surface or substrate . A DC bias of 37V is applied to move the flexible mechanical structure to a position of optimal detection sensitivity and the vibrating tip is brought close enough to have tapping mode like operation with intermittent contact. Diffraction order can be detected by detector when a beam is diffracted by grating upon exiting force sensor .

The single shot signals collected at this position are shown at the top two rows Row and Row of the four rows of the graph in . The bottom graph in shows a zoomed in version of Row of individual taps where the transient displacement of the flexible mechanical structure due to impact of the tip is clearly seen. If the flexible mechanical structure material were softer or there were a compliant coating on the flexible mechanical structure the measured tap signals would be longer in duration and smaller in amplitude because the tip would spend more time indenting the softer surface While transmitting less force to the flexible mechanical structure . Therefore the tapping force measurement provides elasticity information and this embodiment can be used as a material property sensor for a thin film coating on the flexible mechanical structure.

In addition when the tip leaves contact the flexible mechanical structure is pulled away due to adhesion or capillary forces permitting force spectroscopy measurement methods. When the tip is moved progressively closer it is in contact with the flexible mechanical structure for a longer duration of each cycle and finally it pushes the flexible mechanical structure down during the whole cycle. Thus the simple force sensing structures disclosed herein provide information not available by conventional AFM methods and result in more effective tools for force spectroscopy applications.

The sensitivity of another force sensor in accordance with the present teaching can be described by the following exemplary embodiment depicted in . As shown in a quartz substrate with a sensor flexible mechanical structure is placed on a piezoelectric stack transducer which can be used to approach to the tip and obtain force distance curves. The flexible mechanical structure is aluminum and can be 150 m in diameter 1 m thick and located over a 2 m gap above the rigid diffraction grating electrode . In this case the grating period is 4 m. The gap is open to air through several sacrificial layer etch holes not shown . The grating can be illuminated through the quartz substrate using for example a HeNe laser 632 nm at a 5 angle away from normal to the substrate. The output optical signal can be obtained by recording the intensity of the 1diffraction order beam

For measuring the AFM dynamic tip sample interaction forces the cantilever can be glued on a piezoelectric AC drive transducer that can drive the cantilever at its resonant frequency. The flexible mechanical structure with a stiffness of approximately 76N m as measured at the center using a calibrated AFM cantilever can be used. The DC bias on the flexible mechanical structure is adjusted to 27V to optimize the optical detection and the sensitivity is calibrated as 16 mV nm by contacting the flexible mechanical structure with a calibrated AFM cantilever and a calibrated piezo driver. In this case the broadband RMS noise level of the system was about 3 mV 0.18 nm without much effort to reduce mechanical laser or electrical noise.

A force curve can be produced by moving the piezoelectric stack supporting the substrate with a 20 Hz 850 nm triangular signal and making sure that there is tip flexible mechanical structure contact during a portion of the signal period. The cantilever can be for example a FESP from Veeco Metrology Santa Barbara Calif. with k 2.8N m.

For direct observation of time resolved dynamic interaction forces along the force curve a similar experiment can be performed while the cantilever is driven into oscillation by applying a sinusoidal signal to the AC drive piezo at 67.3 kHz. The single shot transient flexible mechanical structure displacement signal obtained during a cycle of the 20 Hz drive signal is shown in . Dynamic interaction force measurements provide various types of information as indicated by the various interaction regimes A C during the measurement. The data of is shown expanded in in the initial tapping region A intermittent to continuous contact region B and continuous to intermittent contact transition region C respectively.

Starting from the left the cantilever tip is first out of contact with the flexible mechanical structure . At around 1 ms it starts intermittent contact tapping with the flexible mechanical structure as individual taps are detected as shown in . As the cantilever gets closer to the flexible mechanical structure the pulses become uni polar and the distortion is more severe as there are double peaked tap signals when the cantilever gets into contact due to non linear interaction forces as shown . When the tip is in continuous contact which happens around 4.2 ms the displacement signal has the periodicity of the drive signal in addition to distortion that can be caused by contact non linearities and higher order vibration modes of the cantilever with its tip hinged on the flexible mechanical structure . Similarly around 15 ms the cantilever starts breaking off the flexible mechanical structure surface and tapping resumes as shown in . Between 7 ms and 12 ms the curve is not linear.

Individual tapping signals can be filtered by the dynamic response of the flexible mechanical structure . In this example the force sensor was not optimized and the flexible mechanical structure acted as a lightly damped resonator with a resonant frequency at 620 kHz rather than having broadband frequency response that is ideal for fast interaction force measurements. Nevertheless the transfer function of the flexible mechanical structure can be obtained using for example integrated electrostatic actuators as described herein.

Still further shows the measured temporal response of the flexible mechanical structure when a 2V square pulse 100 ns in length is applied in addition to the 27V DC bias at the actuator terminals. Comparing the trace waveform in with averaged data from individual tap signals shown in it can be seen that the stiff cantilever tap is nearly an impulsive force which can be recovered by inverse filtering.

Thus according to various embodiments minimum displacement detection levels down to 10 Hz can be measured and mechanical structures with spring constants in the 0.001 to 10 N m range can be built that can monitor force levels in the pico Newton range. These sensitivity levels can make it useful for a wide range of probe microscopy applications including quantitative interaction force measurements fast imaging in liquids and in air and probe arrays for imaging lithography and single molecule force spectroscopy.

While are examples of sensitivity testing made by applying a force from a tip to the force sensor similar sensitivities can be achieved when a tip is mounted to the force sensor and the force sensor is used to characterize a sample.

Each of the plurality of separate top electrodes can be electrically isolated and formed in the flexible mechanical structure . Moreover the bottom electrode can spaced apart from the separate top electrodes by the gap . Further the bottom electrode can be positioned in the substrate and can be contacted by electrode terminals . Similarly each of the separate top electrodes can be contacted by electrode terminals . In some cases the electrode terminals and can be capacitive sensing terminals that can detect a capacitance change formed between the separate top electrodes and the bottom electrode .

In a voltage can be applied between the electrode terminals and . The voltage can be used to independently control and move any of the separate top electrodes so that they can serve as actuators. Further the separate top electrodes can also perform sensing similar to that of a dual electrode capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer where the vibrations of the sensor flexible mechanical structure are converted to electrical current signals through change in capacitance.

For example the force sensor can be used for fast imaging where bias voltages are applied between the electrode terminals and the bottom electrode terminal and alternating voltages of the same or reverse phase are applied to the electrode terminals and to vibrate the tip vertically or laterally to have intermittent contact with a sample surface. In some cases the forces between the tip and a close by surface can be sensed without contact for non contact imaging. The bias voltages applied to the electrode terminals also control the position of the tip in response to changes in capacitance detected between the electrode terminals and the bottom electrode terminal . An external controller not shown can read the detected capacitance change and generate the control signals bias voltages applied to the electrode terminals and the bottom electrode terminal

The detection surface can be positioned at a free end of the cantilever . Moreover the flexible mechanical structure can be fully clamped around its circumference it can be a clamped clamped beam with a rectangular or H shape where the short edges at the ends are clamped or it can be a cantilever structure or a similar structure that changes shape in a predictable manner in response to a force applied to the tip .

The force sensor shown in can be used for lateral force or friction measurements. For example force sensor can be used to sense torsion created on the flexible mechanical structure shown as . Separate top electrodes can be positioned on the flexible mechanical structure to excite the torsional motion or resonances. Similarly the flexible mechanical structure can be bent asymmetrically shown as due to torsion created by the tip or due to out of phase actuation from the first grating the second grating and the top electrodes acting as electrostatic actuators. In particular a voltage can be applied to the electrical contacts and that contact the first grating and the top electrode respectively. The same voltage can be applied to the electrical contacts and that contact the second grating and the a top electrode respectively. Applying this same voltage can cause the flexible mechanical structure to bend up and down. In contrast similarly applying a differential voltage can cause torsion of the flexible mechanical structure .

A light beam can be directed through the detection surface to impinge on the flexible mechanical structure . The beam reflects off of the flexible mechanical structure a portion of which can be reflective and is diffracted differently by the first grating and the second grating . As shown in the first grating can generate a first set of diffraction orders and the second grating can generate a second set of diffraction orders . The detectors can detect the different diffraction orders. The detector outputs can be added to obtain up and down bending displacement detection. Similarly the outputs can be subtracted to obtain torsional motion and force detection. This information can be obtained when the spring constant for the second bending mode torsion around the mid axis of the flexible mechanical structure clamped clamped beam or a cantilever is known. Thus in addition to acting as actuators the first grating and second grating can be used to optically or capacitively decouple the bending motion from the torsional motion. As such the sensed outputs of these detectors yield both bending and torsional motion information. One can also use separate beams to illuminate the plurality of gratings.

The force sensor shown in can extend the tip actuation range without degradation in optical displacement measurement sensitivity. For example the tip can be positioned at a relatively large distance away from the grating . In this manner the tip can be moved large distances without shorting or damaging the sensor . Moreover the grating can be actuated to keep the detection sensitivity at an optimal level. For example the gating can be actuated a distance of 4 where is the wavelength of light to provide proper sensitivity.

The tip and flexible mechanical structure can be spaced away from the grating in various ways. For example rigid supports can be formed on the first detection surface to support the first detection surface . In this manner the flexible mechanical structure is separated from the grating at a predetermined distance. A second detection surface can be separated from the first detection surface by a gap so as to provide a predetermined separation distance. The grating can be formed on the second detection surface .

Operation of the sensor is similar to that described above. For example light is directed through the first detection surface which can be transparent. The light passes through the transparent conductor and through the grating and impinges the flexible mechanical structure . The light is reflected from the flexible mechanical structure and is diffracted by grating before being detected by detectors .

According to various embodiments the thin piezoelectric film can comprise a piezoelectric material such as for example ZnO or AlN. The piezoelectric film can be deposited and patterned on the flexible mechanical structure along with the tip . The piezoelectric actuator can form for example a bimorph structure that can be bent and vibrated by applying DC and AC signals through the electrodes and . According to various embodiments the grating can be placed off center so as to provide a large range of tip motion that can be detected without losing sensitivity.

For example force sensor can be used to measure and image the elasticity or adhesion of the surface of sample . Further the grating can be used with electrode to provide actuation of the flexible mechanical structure by applying a voltage between contacts and respectively. The elasticity information can be measured by applying known dynamic and quasi static forces to the surface with the tip using an external actuator or by applying voltage to the terminals and . At the same time the diffraction order intensities can be monitored by the optical detectors or a capacitance change can be detected by electrical means to determine the resulting tip displacement. Viscoelasticity or adhesion can be calculated using computer models well known by those who are skilled in the art of probe microscopy.

Force sensor can be used to measure and image the topography of the surface of sample similarly as described herein using beam to generate diffraction orders that can be detected by detectors . In the case of force sensor the grating can be used with electrode to provide actuation of the flexible mechanical structure by applying a voltage between contacts and respectively.

Still further the force sensor can be used to measure and image the surface potential of sample . In the case of force sensor the grating can be used with electrode to provide actuation of the flexible mechanical structure by applying a voltage between contacts and respectively. Moreover the sample can be biased with respect to the tip of the force sensor using the electrical terminal to assist in surface potential measurements. The tip on the force sensor can have a separate electrical terminal which is electrically isolated from the other electrodes and and placed in the dielectric sensor flexible mechanical structure . The surface potential can then be measured using a electric potential measurement device connected between terminals and . Furthermore an external source can be connected to terminals and and the current flow in that electrical circuit can be measured to locally determine the flow of ions or electrons available from the sample or in a solution that the force sensor is immersed.

As described previously the fore sensors and can be used to obtain surface topography and elasticity information. This information can be used by an external controller to adjust the position of the tips of individual force sensors to optimize the measurements. As such the array can be used to measure elasticity electrochemical potential optical reflectivity and florescence while also imaging the surface.

In operation as shown for example in a light can be directed at the cantilever through the hole . The light is reflected from the cantilever and then diffracted by the grating . Various diffraction orders can be detected by detectors .

As shown in the force sensor can be fabricated for example on a detection surface and placed on a holder which can be attached to an external piezoelectric actuator piezo tube . The intensity of for example the 1diffraction order of light diffracted by a grating in the force sensor is detected by the detector as the tip displacement signal. For example with a 4 m grating period and a 670 nm laser wavelength the 1diffraction order is reflected at a 9.6 angle from the grating normal. Tilting the detection surface by 6.2 with respect to the incident beam provides a total of 22 angular deflection. According to various embodiments with the force sensor significantly all of the light can be reflected from the grating and the flexible mechanical structure eliminating optical interference problems due to reflections from the sample . This can provide a clean background for tip displacement measurements.

The performance of the AFM having a force sensor such as those described herein can be characterized using an integrated electrostatic actuator. For example an optical interference curve with a DC bias range of 24 36 V was traced and the bias was adjusted for optimum sensitivity point at 30 V. The displacement sensitivity at this bias level was 204 mV nm. The RMS noise measured in the full DC 800 kHz bandwidth of the photodetector was 18 mV RMS. This value confirmed by spectrum analyzer measurements corresponds to 1 10 Hz minimum detectable displacement noise with 1 f corner frequency of 100 Hz. Using the laser power available from the 0and 1orders and differential detection this value can be lowered well below 5 10 Hz without increasing the laser power or using etalon detection. The dynamic response of a typical flexible mechanical structure was also measured using electrostatic actuation indicating a resonance frequency of 720 kHz with a quality factor of 4.1 suitable for fast tapping mode imaging.

Two controller schemes interfaced with the AFM system can be used. The first scheme is used with the first processor comprising a controller and a RMS detector for material property measurement and imaging using transient interaction force signals. The Z input of the piezo tube is driven to generate a 2 kHz 120 nm peak sinusoidal signal while the controller keeps constant the RMS value of the photo detector signal generated by the force sensor when it taps on the sample . The 2 kHz signal frequency is chosen as a compromise between the ability to generate adequate vertical Z direction displacement of the piezo tube and the frequency response of the internal RMS detector for a typical force sensor structure . The second controller scheme is used with the second processor for fast tapping mode imaging. In this case the Z input of the piezo tube is disabled and the integrated electrostatic actuator is used to generate a 10 nm peak to peak free air tapping signal in the 500 700 kHz range as well as the signals to control the force sensor tip position keeping the RMS value of the tip vibration at the desired set point.

In this particular case during phase the tip is away from the sample surface where it experiences long range attractive forces. When brought close to the surface the tip jumps to contact 0.2 nm change in tip position phase II and remains in contact for about 14 of the cycle. In the middle of the period the repulsive force applied to the sample reaches to a peak value of 163 nN 1.22 nm tip displacement phase III . When the tip is withdrawn the tip experiences capillary forces of 133 nN phase IV before breaking off from the liquid film on the sample surface phase V . As shown in the controller of can be used to stabilize the signal with a constant RMS so that the output signal of the force sensor shows individual and repeatable taps on the sample . The signals shown are averaged 100 times on a digitizing oscilloscope and the noise level is less than 1 nN with 800 kHz measurement bandwidth.

An application of this mode of operation is the measurement of local viscoelastic properties. For example in individual tap signals obtained on 100 silicon E 117 GPa and photoresist PR Shipley 1813 E 4 GPa samples using a sensor with having a tip 50 nm radius of curvature were compared. The maximum repulsive force is significantly larger for the silicon sample even though the tip sample contact time is less than that of photoresist PR indicating that the silicon is stiffer than PR. Consequently the positive slope of the time signal during the initial contact to silicon sample is significantly larger than it is when in contact with the PR sample. The silicon sample also shows higher capillary hysteresis. Both of these results are consistent with existing models and data. Moreover the tip can encounter different long range van der Waals or electrostatic forces on these two samples.

The results shown in demonstrate a unique feature of the force sensors described herein for dynamic force measurements. In particular the output signal is generated only when there is an interaction force on the tip. With broad bandwidth and high sensitivity the force sensors enable direct measurement of transient interaction forces during each individual tap with high resolution and without background signal. This provides information on properties of the sample such as adhesion capillary forces as well as viscoelasticity.

The force sensor can be used to image various material properties by recording at each pixel the salient features of the tap signal. For example the AFM system shown in can be used to monitor transient interaction forces. The first controller of system can be used to maintain a constant RMS value of the output signal while scanning the tapping tip . shows the transient tap signals on the PR and silicon regions of a sample that having 360 nm thick 2 m wide PR strips with 4 m periodicity patterned on silicon surface. Significant differences exist between the tap signals in terms of both the attractive and repulsive forces acting on the tip . For example the silicon surface exhibits a much larger adhesion force when compared to the PR surface. Because the first controller attempts to maintain a constant RMS value over the sample it forces the tip to indent more into the PR region. As such the tip experiences a larger repulsive force. The shape of the individual tap signals in the attractive region has a strong dependence on the environment.

To form an image in which sample adhesion dominates the contrast mechanism a peak detector circuit can be used to record the peak attractive force PAF as the pixel value such as points A Ain . Simultaneously the sample topography can be recorded using a fixed RMS value set point. shows the resulting adhesion PAF and topography images and respectively of the sample. In the topography image the stripes correspond to the 360 nm high PR pattern Shipley 1805 and stripes correspond to the silicon surface. In the PAF image the silicon surface appears brighter than PR due to higher adhesion forces. By recording the peak repulsive force PRF as the pixel value images where sample viscoelasticity dominates the contrast such as at points R Rin can be obtained.

Simultaneously recorded PRF and topography images of the same sample region are shown in at and respectively. The PRF image shows a reversed contrast when compared to the PAF image while the topography image is repeatable. The PR strips appear brighter in the PRF image as indicated by the individual tap signals shown in . Also many more contamination particles are adhered to the silicon surface as compared to the PR strips and these particles are seen with high contrast. This is consistent with higher adhesion measured on the silicon in the PAF image .

Although a simple controller based on the RMS value set point is described in this embodiment it is contemplated that different control schemes such as those sampling individual tap signals at desired time instants and use those values in the control loop can also be used. For example if the peak value of the repulsive force is kept constant as the control variable images where the contact to peak force time determines the contrast a direct measure of sample stiffness can be obtained. Several existing models can then be used to convert these images to quantitative material properties. Similarly by detecting the attractive force peaks before and after the contact one can obtain quantitative information on the hysteresis of the adhesion forces.

A standard calibration grating with 20 nm high 1 m wide sharp steps with 2 m periodicity was used as the fast imaging sample NGR 22010 from Veeco Metrology . shows the images of a 4 m 250 nm area 512 16 pixels of the grating with line scan rates of 1 Hz 5 Hz 20 Hz and 60 Hz. shows the cross sectional profiles of individual scan lines for each image. The AFM system had an x y scan capability that can go up to 60 Hz.

For comparison show the tapping mode images and line scans using a conventional AFM system on the same sample used in the example of . The commercial AFM system used a tapping mode cantilever. The cantilever was made of silicon and had a 300 kHz resonance frequency TESP A from Veeco Metrology . In this case the tapping piezo on the cantilever holder was used as the actuator.

As can be seen in the figures AFM systems described herein are able to resolve the grating with at least a 20 Hz line scan rate and in some cases a 60 Hz line scan rate. In contrast conventional AFM systems are not able to follow the sharp steps starting at 5 Hz and fail to produce a viable image after 20 Hz line scan rate. The imaging bandwidth of the AFM system described herein was about 6 kHz. However controlling the dynamics of the air flow in and out of etch holes on two sides of the flexible mechanical structure such as those shown at in . With a sealed cavity the imaging bandwidth of various force sensors described herein can be increased to more than 60 kHz. Moreover since the force sensor unit is a well damped system even in air methods other than RMS detection can be used to implement faster controllers.

The light source can be an optical fiber or the end of a microfabricated waveguide with an appropriate reflector to direct the light to the desired location in the force sensor unit such as a diffraction grating . The optical diffraction grating structure exists above the light source and is characterized by alternating regions of reflective and transparent passages. A gap forming a cavity is formed between the grating and the detection surface can be sealed at some desired pressure including low pressures with any gas or gas mixture or can be open to ambient. Further a flexible mechanical structure also called a reflective surface or reflective diaphragm exists above the diffraction grating that reflects light back towards the detection surface . The diffraction grating and the reflective surface together form a phase sensitive diffraction grating.

When illuminated with the light source as shown diffracted light reflects back towards the detection surface in the form of diffracted orders and with intensity depending on the relative position between the reflective surface and the diffraction grating or the gap thickness. The diffracted orders and emerge on both the right and left side and are traditionally numbered as shown in . For the phase sensitive diffraction grating with 50 fill factor i.e. reflective and transparent passages with the same width only the zero order and all odd orders emerge. The intensity of any one or any subset of these orders can be measured with photo diodes to obtain information about the relative distance between the diffraction grating and the reflective surface . The angles of the orders are determined by the diffraction grating period and the wavelength of the incident light . For example in the far field the angle of the order n will be given by the relation 1 

In order to illustrate how the intensity of the reflected orders depends on the gap thickness the normalized intensity of the zero and first orders are plotted versus the gap in assuming normal incidence. The remaining odd orders i.e. 3 5 etc. are in phase with the 1but have decreasing peak intensities. This behavior can be obtained when the light source remains coherent over the distance between the reflector and the diffraction grating .

Furthermore the diffracted orders can be steered to desired locations using structures such as Fresnel lenses. For this purpose the gratings can be curved or each grating finger can be divided into sections of sub wavelength sized gratings.

Also using wavelength division multiplexing light with different wavelengths can be combined and used to illuminate a multiplicity of force sensors with different grating periods. The reflected diffraction orders from different force sensors can either be converted to electrical signals by separate photodetectors or the reflected light at different wavelengths can be combined in an optical waveguide or optical fiber to minimize the number of optical connections to a processor that subsequently decodes the information carried at different wavelengths. Therefore a multiplicity of force sensors can be interrogated using a single physical link or a reduced number of physical links to a processing system.

According to various embodiments such as chemical and biological sensors the reflective surface can be made of single material or a multi layered material that changes its optical properties such as reflectivity in response to a chemical or biological agent. Similarly the reflective surface can be a micromachined cantilever or a bridge structure made of single or layered material that deforms due to thermal chemical magnetic or other physical stimulus. For example an infrared IR sensor can be constructed by having a bimorph structure including an IR absorbing outer layer and a reflective layer facing the light source . In other embodiments such as a microphone or a pressure sensor the reflector can be in the shape of a diaphragm.

In many applications moving or controlling the position of the reflective surface may be desired for self calibration sensitivity optimization and signal modulation purposes. For example if the reflective surface is a diaphragm or flexible mechanical structure as in the case of a microphone or a capacitive micromachined transducer vibrating the diaphragm to produce sound in a surrounding fluid may be desired for transmission and self calibration. Also while measuring the displacement of the diaphragm controlling the nominal gap height to a position that will result in maximum possible sensitivity for the measurement may be desired. These positions correspond to points of maximum slope on the curves in where it can be seen graphically that a change in gap thickness results in a maximum change in intensity of the diffracted order. These examples can use an added actuation function that can be accomplished with electrostatic actuation. In one exemplary embodiment the entire diaphragm structure or just a certain region thereof can be made electrically conductive. This can be accomplished by using a non conductive material for the reflective surface such as a stretched polymer flexible mechanical structure polysilicon silicon nitride or silicon carbide and then making the material conductive in the desired regions either through doping or by depositing and patterning a conductive material such as aluminum silver or any metal or doping the flexible mechanical structure such as when the flexible mechanical structure comprises polysilicon.

In another exemplary embodiment the entire diffraction grating or a portion of the grating can be made conductive. The flexible mechanical structure and diffraction grating can together form a capacitor which can hold charge under an applied voltage. The strength of the attraction pressure generated by the charges can be adjusted by controlling the voltage and precise control of the flexible mechanical structure position is possible.

This displacement measuring scheme has the sensitivity of a Michelson interferometer which can be used to measure displacements down to 1 10 for 1 Hz bandwidth for 1 mW laser power. Various embodiments disclosed herein can provide this interferometric sensitivity in a very small volume and can enable integration of light source reference mirrors and detectors in a mechanically stable monolithic or hybrid package. This compact implementation further reduces the mechanical noise in the system and also enables easy fabrication of arrays. The high sensitivity and low noise achieved by the various embodiments far exceed the performance of other microphones or pressure sensors based on capacitive detection.

Several material choices exist for the detection sufrace that is transparent at the wavelength of the incident light. These include quartz sapphire and many different types of glass and it can be silicon for light in the certain region of the IR spectrum. Furthermore several manufactures sell these materials as standard 100 mm diameter 500 m thick wafers which makes them suitable for all micro fabrication processes including lithographic patterning. As in the force sensor several different material types may be used for the flexible mechanical structure and the cavity between the platform and diaphragm may be evacuated or filled with any type of gas mixture.

The diffraction grating may be made of any reflective material as long as the dimensions are chosen to produce a compliant structure that may be moved electrostatically. As explained for force sensor electrostatic actuation requires a top and bottom electrode. According to various embodiments the diffraction gating can serve as the top electrode and the bottom electrode can be formed on the substrate . Furthermore the distance between these electrodes can be small order of a micrometer to be able to perform the actuation with reasonable voltage levels 

The bottom mirror and the top mirror can be separated by the grating embedded gap or cavity as illustrated in . As mentioned the flexible mechanical structure can have a high reflectance and can act as the top mirror and the bottom mirror can be placed beneath the diffraction grating . The mirror layers can be built for example using a thin metal film a dielectric stack of alternating quarter wave 4 thick media or combination of these two materials.

In contrast to the dielectric mirror case peak intensity amplitude of the first order decreases with the metal mirror reflectance due to the optical loss in the metal film and thus metals of low absorption loss provide good results for the metal mirror applications. In addition the optimal bias position moves toward to a multiple of 2 with the reflectance of the metal mirror. However the optimal bias position can be easily achieved through electrostatic actuation of the flexible mechanical structure .

The scheme of the resonant cavity enhanced optical force sensor can be also applied to the other microstructures described herein with a simple modification of fabrication process.

In addition to remote measurements the force sensor can be remotely actuated to modulate the output signal. For example an acoustic signal at a desired frequency can be directed to the flexible mechanical structure with the grating and the output signal can be measured at the same frequency using a method such as a lock in amplifier. The magnitude and phase of the output signal can give information on the location of the flexible mechanical structure on the optical intensity curve in shown in which in turn may depend on static pressure and other parameters such as temperature etc. Similar modulation techniques can be implemented using electromagnetic radiation where an electrostatically biased flexible mechanical structure with fixed charges on it can be moved by applying electromagnetic forces. In this case the flexible mechanical structure can be made of some dielectric material with low charge leakage.

Various methods can be used to control the thickness of the gap such as for example controlling the flexible mechanical structure position the grating position or both. Furthermore the force sensor allows placement of the grating anywhere in the cavity between the light source and the flexible mechanical structure .

According to various embodiments the use of highly reflective semi transparent layers to enhance displacement sensitivity using Fabry Perot cavity as described by for example the embodiment shown in . For example a Fabry Perot cavity can be implemented with any of the other embodiments mentioned so far when using semitransparent layer is placed in close proximity to the diffraction grating

For example the sensors shown in can place a semi transparent layer on the top or bottom surface of the grating. Further the force sensor shown in can place a semi transparent layer on either the top or backside of the flexible mechanical structure which is where the diffraction grating is located in this case.

For example depicts a cross sectional schematic diagram of another exemplary force sensor in accordance with the present teachings. shows a force sensor comprising a detection surface a flexible mechanical structure also called a diaphragm a first gap A also called a first cavity a second gap B also called a second cavity a first grating A also called a reference grating a second grating B also called a sensing grating a detector and a light source . The second grating B can be formed on the flexible mechanical structure which can be transparent. Moreover the flexible mechanical structure can be formed over the first grating A.

In this embodiment the flexible mechanical structure is or has a reflective diffraction grating second grating B rather than a mirror like uniform reflector surface described above. Moreover the second grating B on the flexible mechanical structure reflector can have the same periodicity as the first grating B but can be offset and can have diffraction fingers whose widths are smaller than the gap between the first grating A. This offset allows some of the incident light to pass through. This structure as shown in allows some of the incident light from light source to transmit through the whole force sensor and also introduces new diffraction orders in the reflected field. As such this provides a different kind of phase grating than those described above.

In contrast when the difference between and is m m 1 3 5 . . . the apparent period of the grating is 2 apparent reflectivity of 1 0 1 0 1 regions assuming perfect transmission through the flexible mechanical structure and the odd diffraction orders are reflected with angles

Here it is assumed that the width of the reflective fingers on the reference grating S and the second grating B on the flexible mechanical structure are the same. This does not have to be the case if the interfering beams go through different paths and experience losses due to reflection at various interfaces and also incidence angle variations. The diffraction grating geometry can then be adjusted to equalize the reflected order intensities for optimized interference.

In this double grating structure shown for example in the intensity of the odd and even numbered orders change with 180 out of phase with each other when the gap B between the reference grating A and sensing grating B changes. The even numbered diffraction orders are in phase with the zero order reflection considered in the previous embodiments.

One advantage of having other off axis even diffraction orders in phase with the specular reflection is that it enables one to easily use differential techniques. This is achieved by taking the difference of the outputs of two detectors positioned to detect odd and even orders respectively. Hence the common part of the laser intensity noise which is common on both orders can be eliminated.

Microscopy probe units also called probe units such those shown in are also provided. The probe units can be a cartridge that can include various combinations of a probe tip a force sensor a detector and or a light source. Because the tip interacting with a sample may need to be changed frequently exemplary probe units can be easily positioned in a microscopy system. Moreover the entire probe unit can be disposable. Unlike conventional AFM system that require the tip of a thin curved cantilever beam to be aligned using a laser the present probe units can be simply placed at a predetermined position. For example the probe units can include alignment guides for simple positioning. The probe units can also include a force sensor that can include a flexible mechanical structure separated from a detection surface by a gap where the probe unit is designed to be placed at a predetermined location on a microscopy system. Alignment structures such as mechanical guides can be used to easily position the probe unit in the microscopy system. In addition to mechanical guides optical signals such as those captured by a photodetector can also be used to fine tune the positioning of the probe unit. In some cases the positioning may only need lateral positioning of the probe unit by sliding it over a flat rigid surface of the microscopy system. Moreover calibration signals can be applied to the probe unit to determine probe parameters such as resonance frequency stiffness etc. before measurements are taken. Furthermore light sources with tunable wavelengths can be used to calibrate the displacement sensitivity without touching an external surface with the probe tip. The probe unit can also include an integrated actuator such as shown in and a sensitive probe force readout using a light source and photodetectors or electrical circuits to measure the tip displacement based on capacitance changes.

Electrical connection can be coupled to the detection surface and electrical connection can be coupled to the flexible mechanical structure . As described above the electrical connections can supply electrical signals to actuate the flexible mechanical structure and or the detection surface such as when using grating . As such the grating need not be physically connected to the electrode.

Electrical connections and can apply DC and or AC forces to the flexible mechanical structure and when desired to detection surface such as grating as described above. Forces can be applied for optimization of sensitivity imaging and manipulation purposes. Additional electrical connections can be used to apply and or detect electrical signals between the force sensor and a surface of the sample . In instances where the electrical signal is used for detection purposes such as embodiments using capacitive piezoresistive or piezoelectric detection the microscopy system should have suitable electrical connections as well. The exemplary basic microscopy probe unit can be used as shown in as part of a larger probe microscopy system.

According to various embodiments the probe unit can be easily positioned and aligned in a microscopy system. For example the probe unit can be configured to be guided into proper alignment using guides attached to the microscopy system. In some cases the probe unit can include a rigid mechanical structure described in detail below that itself can be easily positioned in a microscopy system.

The probe unit can further comprise a rigid mechanical structure . The rigid mechanical structure can be used to rigidly hold the force sensor and detection surface including the substrate and the detector . According to various embodiments the probe unit can further comprise a light source which as shown in can also be attached to the rigid mechanical structure . The rigid mechanical structure can be made of a material that is transparent to predetermined wavelengths of light such as those emitted by the light source and those reflected from the grating . For example the rigid mechanical structure can be glass fused silica quartz sapphire or any solid material transparent to the wavelength of the light source. In addition to mechanical support the rigid mechanical structure can provide a clear optical path for light emitted from the light source to impinge the flexible mechanical structure . Moreover a clear optical path can be provided for light reflected from the grating to the detector . The clear optical path can be air an evacuated cavity or a transparent solid such as glass fused silica quartz sapphire or any solid material transparent to the wavelength of the light source.

The probe unit can also include alignment structures that can be used to guide the force sensor and detection surface into a predetermined position on the rigid mechanical structure . While the alignment structures in are shown as blocks any alignment structure known to one of ordinary skill in the art can be used. Probe units can also include alignment structures to easily position the entire probe unit in a microcopy system.

The probe unit shown in can also include an actuator such as those describe above. According to various embodiments a vertical actuator can be attached to the rigid mechanical structure to move the probe tip . For example the probe tip can be positioned substantially normal to the flexible mechanical structure along a vertical axis . As such the vertical actuator can move the entire probe unit up and down along the vertical axis to approach the sample surface. In another embodiment the vertical actuator can be positioned between the rigid mechanical structure and the force sensor to allow for movement of the probe tip along the vertical axis. The vertical actuator can be a combination of a large range about 1 m to about 1 cm stepper motor in addition to a fine adjustment actuator. In some embodiments the fine adjustment actuator can have an actuation bandwidth from DC to 10 MHz to support various imaging modes for the force sensor. According to various embodiments a lateral actuator can be coupled to the sample or to the rigid mechanical structure. This can be useful for imaging purposes. In particular the lateral actuator can scan the force sensor in the lateral direction. For fast imaging applications an actuator connected to the force sensor can be used as the fastest vertical or lateral actuator in the system.

According to various embodiments the sample can be placed on a stage that is vertically and laterally actuated and the rigid mechanical structure remains stationary with respect to the base of the sample . The vertical sample actuator can be a combination of a large range about 1 m to about 1 cm stepper motor in addition to a fine adjustment actuator. For measurement and imaging an additional actuator connected to the force sensor can be used as the fastest vertical or lateral actuator in the system.

According to various embodiments the light source can be a light source such as one described above. In certain embodiments the light source can have a temporal coherence length equal to or greater than two times the distance between the grating whether movable or stationary and the flexible mechanical structure for example this can be the distance of the gap . The light source can be fixed at a location that is a suitable distance away with a direct optical path to the grating. Moreover the light beam should have a spot size that is wide enough to illuminate at least four to five grating periods. For example for a grating having at least four gratings with a period of about 4 m the beam should have a diameter of at least about 16 m to illuminate at least four of the gratings. In various embodiments the beam should be incident on the grating at an angle close to the normal of the grating. For example can be between about 0 degrees to about 30 degrees away from normal.

According to various embodiments detectors can comprise photodetectors such as photodiodes. As described above the photodetectors can capture reflected diffraction orders by being located at a suitable distance such as far field from the grating so that the diffraction orders are separated and thus resolved. As in the case of the light source the locations of the detectors can be predetermined by the wavelength of the light source and the grating period. A simple formula for the diffraction angle of the norder is given by sin 4 

where is the wavelength of the light source d is the grating period and is the angle away from normal. Several photodetectors can be provided to capture more diffraction orders and to utilize more of the optical power so as to obtain higher sensitivity and lower measurement noise. The 0diffraction order and higher diffraction order signals are complementary and can be subtracted from each other to minimize light intensity noise from the measurements. The photodetectors can be made large enough to detect as much light as needed in the diffraction order beams to minimize noise that can come from vibrations.

As shown in the probe unit can also include optical components such as lens to shape the optical beams for effective illumination of the grating and to improve detection of the reflected diffraction orders. For example the probe unit can include a lens and a lens disposed in the rigid mechanical structure . Lens can shape and direct light emitted from the light source toward the grating . Further lens can direct and shape the reflected light from the grating to the detectors . In addition to lenses mirrors of suitable size and reflectivity can be part of the probe unit. For example as shown in a mirror can be used to direct incident light from the light source to the grating or reflected light to detector . If desired a lens such as lens can be positioned to focus light. According to various embodiments the mirrors can be used to place the light source and detectors in the probe unit to reduce the probe unit volume or weight. Other lenses and or mirror configurations as well as other optical elements such as beam splitters and fiber optic elements can be used to direct light in the probe unit as will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

According to various embodiments the probe unit can have force sensors such as in and . These structures can be used to detect forces applied to the flexible mechanical structure in different directions and also can be used to actuate a probe tip in different directions. As shown in and these force sensor can have a plurality of diffraction gratings of the same periodicity but different orientation a plurality of diffraction gratings of the different periodicity but different or same orientation or for example can have a plurality of separate electrodes for capacitive detection and actuation. In this case the probe unit can have multiple light sources and multiple photodetectors to measure the probe deflection under each separate grating or can have a single light source but different sets of photodetectors for the diffraction orders reflected from each grating. The separation of these diffraction orders is enabled by either the grating period or grating orientation. Similarly the probe unit can have multiple electrical circuits each of which is used to detect the capacitance changes due to the motion of the probe structure over the separate electrode.

A benefit of the simple design of the probe unit is that the overall structure of the microscopy system can be quite small. Examples of a small microscopy systems are describe in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 704 932 filed Nov. 10 2003 and which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. For example the size of various microscopy systems can be reduced by using a semiconductor laser such as vertical cavity surface emitting lasers VCSELs as the light source. depicts a probe unit for use in such a small microscopy system. The probe unit can comprise a force sensor a substrate a flexible mechanical structure a gap a grating a probe tip a light source a detector and alignment structures . The light source can be a semiconductor laser such as a VCSEL. In a probe unit similar to probe unit is shown with the inclusion of an X Y Z scanning system . In the dotted line shows the path of light from the light source and the dashed line shows the path of reflected from the grating .

According to various embodiments the probe unit can be adapted to be used with existing probe microscopy systems such as in . As shown in a force sensor structure can be used to adapt the force sensor to the AFM system .

According to various embodiments a probe unit can made to fit in a volume of about 1 mmto about 5 mm. Moreover the probe units described herein can be disposable. Still further the probe units can be coupled to a scanning system with mechanical clamps and electrical input output signal connectors. In some embodiments several independent probe units can be combined to form an array for fast parallel material property or metrology measurements over a long area such as semiconductor metrology applications over a wafer. For example several probe units can be connected to a laterally actuated platform where individual probe units have independent vertical actuators or several probe units can be connected to a platform where individual probe units have independent vertical actuators and the sample is placed on a laterally and vertically actuated platform. Then a microscope unit with multiple light sources and detectors can be used for parallel readout of the probe units for parallel imaging and force measurements.

The probe units can also be used to image in fluid media as described above. For example a probe unit can be immersed in a fluid for imaging samples with biological and chemical relevance. For this purpose a so called fluid cell can be implemented to facilitate introduction of fluids to the probe microscope while isolating the electrical and optical connections.

Turning to a simple schematic of a probe unit including electrostatic actuation and capacitive detection is shown. The probe unit can be similar to those described above and can further include an electrostatic actuator circuit and a capacitive readout circuit . This configuration may be more suitable for some applications where integration into a smaller space is desired.

According to various embodiments the probe unit can also include multiple signal processing capabilities for electrochemical thermal and optical measurements. Still further the probe units can include lithography capabilities that can be achieved using for example multi tip devices.

It is noted that various microscope configurations described herein can be connected to a microscope electronics system that may include a controller image processor and other functions that can be used to collect perform calculations display images and determine material properties of the samples at the nanoscale.

In various embodiments there is no need to tilt the probe unit with respect to the sample surface in contrast to the case of beam bounce based optical detection of AFM cantilever deflection. The probe unit can be placed on a flat surface parallel to the rigid mechanical structure that carries the laser and detectors and the tip can be vertical to the sample surface. This configuration helps with the mechanical property analysis because the vertical forces can be applied to the sample without applying lateral forces. In tilted cantilevers increasing the normal force on the tip inevitably causes the tip to slide applying lateral forces and making the contact analysis difficult.

While the probe units detailed herein are described in terms of optical interferometric readout and electrostatic actuation other detection actuation combinations such as capacitive detection and actuation such as capacitive actuation and optical beam bounce detection can also be used with similar capabilities.

The sensors described herein can be used with various AFM systems and methods to measure for example the attractive and repulsive forces experienced by the tip to provide information on various surface forces and sample properties. Moreover the force sensors described herein can be used with several AFM methods including nanoindentation force modulation ultrasonic AFM pulsed force mode and dynamic force spectroscopy that have been developed to characterize the viscoelastic properties of the material under investigation.

Thus a force sensor for probe microscope for imaging is provided that can offer the unique capability for measuring interaction forces at high speeds with high resolution. In addition to optical interferometer various integrated readout techniques including capacitive piezoelectric or piezoresistive can be used. Similarly the actuators described herein can be a thin film piezoelectric a magnetic or a thermal actuator. Further force sensors with multiple tips where several sensing and actuation functions are implemented in the same device are also envisioned. Still further electrical measurements chemical measurements information storage and nanoscale manipulations can be performed all while simultaneously obtaining topography images of the sample in gas or liquid media. As such the sensors and the methods of imaging described herein open a new area in the field of probe microscopy. This new device can enable high speed imaging and provide images of elastic properties and surface conditions of the sample under investigation.
