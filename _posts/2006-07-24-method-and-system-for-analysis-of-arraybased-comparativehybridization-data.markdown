Embodiments of the present invention include methods and systems for analysis of comparative hybridization data including comparative genomic hybridization CGH data such as CGH data obtained from microarray experiments. Various embodiments of the present invention include global noise based scoring methods for CGH data and methods for identifying sets of one or more contiguous chromosomal DNA subsequences that are amplified or deleted in cells from particular tissue samples. When combined with microarray based experimental systems method embodiments of the present invention provide markedly increased quantitative precision in the identification of chromosomal abnormalities including amplified and deleted DNA subsequences based on CGH data. Additional embodiments of the present invention are directed to detecting by comparative hybridization deletion amplifications and other changes to general biopolymer sequences including biopolymers other than DNA.

Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for analysis of comparative genomic hybridization CGH data. The methods and systems are general and applicable to comparative hybridization data obtained from a variety of different experimental approaches and protocols. Described embodiments below are particularly applicable to microarray based CGH data obtained from high resolution microarrays containing oligonucleotide probes that provide relatively uniform and closely spaced coverage of the DNA sequence or sequences representing one or more chromosomes. One application for methods of the present invention is for detecting amplified and deleted genes. Examples are discussed below. However any subsequence of chromosomal DNA may be amplified or deleted and CGH techniques may be applied to generally detect amplification or deletion of chromosomal DNA subsequences. Comparative hybridization methods can be used to detect amplification or deletion of subsequences of any information containing biopolymer and other sequence changes and abnormalities.

Prominent information containing biopolymers include deoxyribonucleic acid DNA ribonucleic acid RNA including messenger RNA mRNA and proteins. shows the chemical structure of a small four subunit single chain oligonucleotide or short DNA polymer. The oligonucleotide shown in includes four subunits 1 deoxyadenosine abbreviated A 2 deoxythymidine abbreviated T 3 deoxycytodine abbreviated C and 4 deoxyguanosine abbreviated G. Each subunit and is generically referred to as a deoxyribonucleotide and consists of a purine in the case of A and G or pyrimidine in the case of C and T covalently linked to a deoxyribose. The deoxyribonucleotide subunits are linked together by phosphate bridges such as phosphate . The oligonucleotide shown in and all DNA polymers is asymmetric having a 5 end and a 3 end each end comprising a chemically active hydroxyl group. RNA is similar in structure to DNA with the exception that the ribose components of the ribonucleotides in RNA have a 2 hydroxyl instead of a 2 hydrogen atom such as 2 hydrogen atom in and include the ribonucleotide uridine similar to thymidine but lacking the methyl group instead of a ribonucleotide analog to deoxythymidine. The RNA subunits are abbreviated A U C and G.

In cells DNA is generally present in double stranded form in the familiar DNA double helix form. shows a symbolic representation of a short stretch of double stranded DNA. The first strand is written as a sequence of deoxyribonucleotide abbreviations in the 5 to 3 direction and the complementary strand is symbolically written in 3 to 5 direction. Each deoxyribonucleotide subunit in the first strand is paired with a complementary deoxyribonucleotide subunit in the second strand . In general a G in one strand is paired with a C in a complementary strand and an A in one strand is paired with a T in a complementary strand. One strand can be thought of as a positive image and the opposite complementary strand can be thought of as a negative image of the same information encoded in the sequence of deoxyribonucleotide subunits.

A gene is a subsequence of deoxyribonucleotide subunits within one strand of a double stranded DNA polymer. A gene can be thought of as an encoding that specifies or a template for construction of a particular protein. illustrates construction of a protein based on the information encoded in a gene. In a cell a gene is first transcribed into single stranded mRNA. In the double stranded DNA polymer composed of strands and has been locally unwound to provide access to strand for transcription machinery that synthesizes a single stranded mRNA complementary to the gene containing DNA strand. The single stranded mRNA is subsequently translated by the cell into a protein polymer with each three ribonucleotide codon such as codon of the mRNA specifying a particular amino acid subunit of the protein polymer . For example in the codon UAU specifies a tyrosine amino acid subunit . Like DNA and RNA a protein is also asymmetrical having an N terminal end and a carboxylic acid end .

In eukaryotic organisms including humans each cell contains a number of extremely long DNA double strand polymers called chromosomes. Each chromosome can be thought of abstractly as a very long deoxyribonucleotide sequence. Each chromosome contains hundreds to thousands of subsequences corresponding to genes. The exact correspondence between a particular subsequence identified as a gene and the protein encoded by the gene can be somewhat complicated for reasons outside the scope of the present invention. However for the purposes of describing embodiments of the present invention a chromosome may be thought of as a linear DNA sequence of contiguous deoxyribonucleotide subunits that can be viewed as a linear sequence of DNA subsequences. In certain cases the subsequences are genes each gene specifying a particular protein. But these embodiments are far more general. Amplification and deletion of any DNA subsequence or group of DNA subsequences can be detected by the described methods regardless of whether or not the DNA subsequences correspond to protein sequence specifying biological genes to DNA subsequences specifying various types of non protein encoding RNAs or to other regions with defined biological roles. Moreover these methods may be applied to other types of biopolymers to detect changes in biopolymer subsequence occurrence. The term gene is used in the following as a notational convenience and should be understood as simply an example of a biopolymer subsequence. Similarly although the described embodiments are directed to analyzing DNA chromosomal sequences the sequences of any information containing biopolymer are analyzable by methods of the present invention. Therefore the term chromosome and related terms are used in the following as a notational convenience and should be understood as an example of a biopolymer or biopolymer sequence.

As shown in the second chromosome of the first pair of chromosomes includes the same genes at the same positions. Each chromosome of the second pair of chromosomes includes eleven genes and each chromosome of the third pair of chromosomes includes four genes . Of course in a real organism there are generally many more chromosome pairs and each chromosome includes many more genes. However the simplified hypothetical genome shown in is more suitable for simply describing embodiments of the present invention. Note that in each chromosome pair one chromosome is originally obtained from the mother of the organism and the other chromosome is originally obtained from the father of the organism. Thus the chromosomes of the first chromosome pair are referred to as chromosome C1 and C1. While in general each chromosome of a chromosome pair has the same genes positioned at the same location along the length of the chromosome the genes inherited from one parent may differ slightly from the genes inherited from the other parent. Different versions of a gene are referred to as alleles. Common differences include single deoxyribonucleotide subunit substitutions at various positions within the DNA subsequence corresponding to a gene.

Although differences between genes and mutations of genes may be important in the predisposition of cells to various types of cancer and related to cellular mechanisms responsible for cell transformation cause and effect relationships between different forms of genes and pathological conditions are often difficult to elucidate and prove and very often indirect. However other genomic abnormalities are more easily associated with pre cancerous and cancerous tissues. Two prominent types of genomic aberrations include gene amplification and gene deletion. shows examples of gene deletion and gene amplification in the context of the hypothetical genome shown in . First both chromosomes C and chromosome C of the variant or mutant first chromosome pair are shorter than the corresponding wild type chromosomes Cand Cin the first pair of chromosomes shown in . This shortening is due to deletion of genes and present in the wild type chromosomes and but absent in the variant chromosomes and . This is an example of a double or homozygous gene deletion. Small scale variations of DNA copy numbers can also exist in normal cells. These can have phenotypic implications and can also be measured by CGH methods and analyzed by the methods of the present invention.

Generally deletion of multiple contiguous genes is observed corresponding to the deletion of a substantial subsequence from the DNA sequence of a chromosome. Much smaller subsequence deletions may also be observed leading to mutant and often nonfunctional genes. A gene deletion may be observed in only one of the two chromosomes of a chromosome pair in which case a gene deletion is referred to as being heterozygous. A second chromosomal abnormality in the altered genome shown in is duplication of genes and in the maternal chromosome C of the second chromosome pair . Duplication of one or more contiguous genes within a chromosome is referred to as gene amplification. In the example altered genome shown in the gene amplification in chromosome C is heterozygous since gene amplification does not occur in the other chromosome of the pair C . The gene amplification illustrated in is a two fold amplification but three fold and higher fold amplifications are also observed. An extreme chromosomal abnormality is illustrated with respect to the third chromosome pair in . In the altered genome illustrated in the entire maternal chromosome has been duplicated from a third chromosome creating a chromosome triplet rather than a chromosome pair. This three chromosome phenomenon is referred to as a trisomy in the third chromosome pair. The trisomy shown in is an example of heterozygous gene amplification but it is also observed that both chromosomes of a chromosome pair may be duplicated higher order amplification of chromosomes may be observed and heterozygous and homozygous deletions of entire chromosomes may also occur although organisms with such genetic deletions are generally not viable.

Changes in the number of gene copies either by amplification or deletion can be detected by comparative genomic hybridization CGH techniques. illustrate detection of gene amplification by CGH and illustrate detection of gene deletion by CGH. CGH involves analysis of the relative level of binding of chromosome fragments from sample tissues to single stranded normal chromosomal DNA. The tissues sample fragments hybridize to complementary regions of the normal single stranded DNA by complementary binding to produce short regions of double stranded DNA. Hybridization occurs when a DNA fragment is exactly complementary or nearly complementary to a subsequence within the single stranded chromosomal DNA. In and in subsequent figures one of the hypothetical chromosomes of the hypothetical wild type genome shown in is shown below the x axis of a graph and the level of sample fragment binding to each portion of the chromosome is shown along with the y axis. In the graph of fragment binding is a horizontal line indicative of generally uniform fragment binding along the length of the chromosome . Of course in an actual experiment uniform and complete overlap of DNA fragments prepared from tissue samples may not be possible leading to discontinuities and non uniformities in detected levels of fragment binding along the length of a chromosome. However in general fragments of a normal chromosome isolated from normal tissue samples should at least provide a binding level trend approaching a horizontal line such as line in . By contrast CGH data for fragments prepared from the mutant genotype illustrated in should generally show an increased binding level for those genes amplified in the mutant genotype.

CGH data may be obtained by a variety of different experimental techniques. In one technique DNA fragments are prepared from tissue samples and labeled with a particular chromophore. The labeled DNA fragments are then hybridized with single stranded chromosomal DNA from a normal cell and the single stranded chromosomal DNA then visually inspected via microscopy to determine the intensity of light emitted from labels associated with hybridized fragments along the length of the chromosome. Areas with relatively increased intensity reflect regions of the chromophore amplified in the corresponding tissue chromosome and regions of decreased emitted signal indicate deleted regions in the corresponding tissue chromosome. In other techniques normal DNA fragments labeled with a first chromophore are competitively hybridized to a normal single stranded chromosome with fragments isolated from abnormal tissue labeled with a second chromophore. Relative binding of normal and abnormal fragments can be detected by ratios of emitted light at the two different intensities corresponding to the two different chromophore labels.

A third type of CGH is referred to as microarray based CGH aCGH . illustrate microarray based CGH. In synthetic probe oligonucleotides having sequences equal to contiguous subsequences of hypothetical chromosome and or in the hypothetical normal genome illustrated in are prepared as features on the surface of the microarray . For example a synthetic probe oligonucleotide having the sequence of one strand of the region of chromosome and or is synthesized in feature of the hypothetical microarray . Similarly an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to subsequence of chromosome and is synthesized to produce the oligonucleotide probe molecules of feature of microarray . In actual cases probe molecules may be much shorter relative to the length of the chromosome and multiple different overlapping and non overlapping probes features may target a particular gene. Nonetheless there is a definite well known correspondence between microarray features and genes.

The microarray may be exposed to sample solutions containing fragments of DNA. In one version of aCGH an array may be exposed to fragments labeled with a first chromophore prepared from abnormal tissue and to fragments labeled with a second chromophore prepared from normal tissue. The normalized ratio of signal emitted from the first chromophore versus signal emitted from the second chromophore for each feature provides a measure of the relative abundance of the portion of the normal chromosome corresponding to the feature in the abnormal tissue versus the normal tissue. In the hypothetical microarray of each feature corresponds to a different interval along the length of chromosome and in the hypothetical wild type genome illustrated in . When fragments prepared from a normal tissue sample labeled with a first chromophore and DNA fragments prepared from normal tissue labeled with the second chromophore are both hybridized to the hypothetical microarray shown in and normalized intensity ratios for light emitted by the first and second chromophores are determined the normalized ratios for all features should be relatively uniformly equal to one.

Microarray based CGH data obtained from microarray experiments provide a relatively precise measure of the relative or absolute number of copies of genes in cells of a sample tissue. Sets of aCGH data obtained from pre cancerous and cancerous tissues at different points in time can be used to monitor genome instability in particular pre cancerous and cancerous tissues. Quantified genome instability can then be used to detect and follow the course of particular types of cancers. Moreover quantified genome instabilities in different types of cancerous tissue can be compared in order to elucidate common chromosomal abnormalities including gene amplifications and gene deletions characteristic of different classes of cancers and pre cancerous conditions. Unfortunately biological data can be extremely noisy with the noise obscuring underlying trends and patterns. Scientists diagnosticians and other professionals have therefore recognized a need for statistical methods for normalizing and analyzing aCGH data in particular and CGH data in general in order to identify signals and patterns indicative of chromosomal abnormalities that may be obscured by noise arising from many different kinds of experimental and instrumental variations.

One approach to ameliorating the effects of high noise levels in CGH data involves as a first step normalizing sample signal data by using control signal data. In many aCGH experiments normal control samples including chromosomal DNA fragments of chromosomal DNA fragments isolated from normal tissues are hybridized to arrays as control samples along with DNA fragments or copies isolated or produced from abnormal or diseased tissues for which a measure of chromosomal alterations or abnormalities is sought. Often multiple control samples are available. Therefore rather than simply using the log ratio of the signal generated by hybridization of fragments from diseased tissue to signal generated from one control sample the signal generated from diseased tissue can be normalized using multiple control sample derived signals. It should be noted that the methods of the present invention may be applied to normalization of any signals produced from any type of sample including diseased tissue samples samples produced by particular experiments samples produced at particular times during particular experiments and other samples of interest. The phrase diseased tissue sample is therefore interchangeable in the following discussions with the phrase sample of interest. 

As reviewed above an aCGH array may contain a number of different features each feature generally containing a particular type of probe each probe targeting a particular chromosomal DNA subsequence indexed by index k that represents a genomic location. A subsequence indexed by index k is referred to as subsequence k. 

One can define the signal generated for subsequence k as the sum of the normalized log ratio signals from the different probes targeting subsequence k divided by the number of probes targeting subsequence k or in other words the average log ratio signal value generated from the probes targeting subsequence k as follows 

As such each aCGH data point may be viewed as a log ratio of signals read from a particular feature of a microarray that contains probes targeting a particular subsequence the log ratio of signals representing the ratio of signals emitted from a first label e.g. red used to label fragments of a genome sample and from a second label e.g. green used to label fragments of a normal control genome. Both the sample genome fragments and the normal control fragments hybridize to normal tissue derived probe molecules on the microarray. A normal tissue or sample may be any tissue or sample selected as a control tissue or sample for a particular experiment. The term normal does not necessarily imply that the tissue or sample represents a population average a non diseased tissue or any other subjective or object classification. The sample genome may be obtained from a diseased or cancerous tissue in order to compare the genetic state of the diseased or cancerous tissue to a normal tissue but may also be a normal tissue.

Subsequence deletions and amplifications generally span a number of contiguous subsequences of interest such as genes control regions or other identified subsequences along a chromosome. It therefore makes sense to analyze aCGH data in a chromosome by chromosome fashion statistically considering groups of consecutive subsequences along the length of the chromosome in order to more reliably detect amplification and deletion.

Aspects of the invention include employing copy number aberration calling methods that account for a global noise component in the signal. Embodiments of the invention employ a combined noise factor i.e. total noise factor that includes both a local noise component i.e. a probe to probe noise component and a global noise component. As such it is assumed in embodiments of the invention that the noise of measurement includes both a local noise component that is independent for each subsequence along the chromosome and independent for distinct probes such that the local noise component is not correlated between different probes along the interval and a global noise component which noise component is correlated between probes along the interval.

Aspects of the invention include employing statistical measures to identify sets of consecutive subsequences for which deletion or amplification is relatively strongly indicated. This approach tends to ameliorate the effects of spurious single probe anomalies in the data. This approach is an example of an aberration calling technique in which gene copy anomalies appearing to be above the data noise level are identified.

As indicated above where a total or combined noise component is employed it is assumed that there are essentially two independent sources of noise contributing to the total noise intervals. These two sources are 

As is not correlated between different probes when k probes are averaged using either mean or median it is assumed that the local noise is reduced by a factor of 1 square root over k . Thus the measure of local noise that is employed in the determination of a combined noise factor is 

Assuming that the local and global noise components are independent of each other the combined noise for an interval of length k is described by the following equation square root over . Substituting the term the following formula is obtained 

Where desired the above combined noise factor may be employed in a statistical scoring based protocol of identifying chromosomal aberrations as follows.

One can consider the measured normalized or otherwise processed signals for subsequences along the chromosome of interest to be a vector V as follows V v v . . . v where v C k where v h as defined above. Note that the vector or set V is sequentially ordered by position of subsequences along the chromosome. As such in the first step of embodiments of the invention one obtains a vector of signals comprising normalized hybridization levels for fragments of a biopolymer sequence e.g. chromosome. Next a set of intervals is generated within the vector of signals. As mentioned below the interval length may be varied as desired.

with each interval containing k probes and h is the average log ratio signal of the k probes over the given interval.

In this way each interval is scored with a statistical score where the statistical score is determined using a combined noise factor that includes a local and global noise factor

Under a null model assuming no sequence aberrations the statistic S has a normal distribution of values with mean 0 and variance 1 independent of the number of probes included in the interval I. The statistical significance of the normalized signals for the subsequences in an interval I can be computed by a standard probability calculation based on the area under the normal distribution curve 

It should be noted that various different interval lengths may be used iteratively to compute amplification and deletion probabilities over a particular biopolymer sequence. In other words a range of interval sizes can be used to refine amplification and deletion indications over the biopolymer.

After the probabilities for the observed values for intervals are computed those intervals with computed probabilities outside of a reasonable range of expected probabilities under the null hypothesis of no amplification or deletion are identified and redundancies in the list of identified intervals are removed. In this way intervals with statistical scores that differ from a threshold range bounded by a first threshold value and a second threshold value are identified as comprising copy number aberrations e.g. deletions or amplifications in the biopolymer sequence e.g. chromosome. illustrates one method for identifying and ranking intervals and removing redundancies from lists of intervals identified as corresponding to probable deletions or amplifications. In the intervals for which probabilities are computed along the chromosome C in for diseased tissue with an abnormal chromosome in are shown. Each interval is labeled by an interval number I where x ranges from 1 to 9. For most intervals the calculated probability falls within a range of probabilities consonant with the null hypothesis. In other words neither amplification nor deletion is indicated for most of the intervals. However for intervals I I and I the computed probabilities fall below the range of probabilities expected for the null hypothesis indicating potential subsequence deletion in the diseased tissue sample. Note that if the computed probabilities were above the range of probabilities expected for the null hypothesis potential subsequence amplification in the diseased tissue sample would be indicated. These three intervals are placed into an initial list which is ordered by the significance of the computed probability into an ordered list . Note that interval I exactly includes those subsequences deleted in the diseased tissue chromosome in and therefore reasonably has the highest significance with respect to falling outside the probability range of the null hypothesis. Next all intervals overlapping an interval occurring higher in the ordered list are removed as shown in list where overlapping intervals Iand I with less significance are removed as indicated by the character X placed into the significance column for the entries corresponding to intervals Iand I. The end result is a list containing a single interval that indicates the interval most likely coinciding with the deletion. The final list for real chromosomes containing thousands of subsequences and analyzed using hundreds of intervals may generally contain more than a single entry. Additional details regarding computation of interval scores can be found in Efficient Calculation of Interval Scores for DNA Copy Number Data Analysis Lipson et al. Proceedings of RECOMB 2005 LNCS 3500 p. 83 Springer Verlag.

In certain embodiments where a combined noise factor is employed it may be desirable to determine e.g. in the form of an estimated value the local probe to probe noise and . may be estimated using derivative log ratio spread dlrs 

In order to estimate the combined noise is first estimated e.g. by binning consecutive probes into bins of size k square root over n . A binned vector u is derived by averaging each bin using either mean or median into a single number. is estimated by dlrs u . To make this estimation more robust binning may be repeated using different frame shifts of the first bin. The final estimation of is the median of the different estimation.

In addition to the above may be estimated using alternative methods. Certain of these methods employ signal noise estimation.

Given a log ratio vector v of length n and a significance threshold level tau an alternative way to estimate may employ the following iterative process 

Starting with an initial estimation of alpha 0.01 repeat the following steps a Calculate the list of all aberrant regions that have a score equation 2 above above tau. Note that this score depends on the current value of . This list of aberrations may be regarded as the Signal component of the data b Compute the residual vector r subtract the called aberrations from the vector v. The vector r represent our current estimation of the noise and c Estimate from the residual vector r as explained in the previous subsection and the resulting new until the process converges new alpha is very close to alpha .

In certain embodiments a score based on global error may applied only to intervals with height larger than user defined constant.

In other embodiments min for some K that depends on the number of probes on the array e.g. K square root over N where N is the total number of probes on the array.

Aspects of the invention may score all intervals using a scoring protocol that employs a combined noise factor which includes a global noise component as described above. Alternatively the combined noise scoring factor may only be employed in aberration calling when an interval provides a signal having a height that is less than a predetermined threshold or constant e.g. less than about 0.5 such as less than about 0.3 including less than about 0. In these embodiments a dual type scoring protocol may be employed where a combined noise scoring protocol such as that described above is employed for the intervals having signals with heights less than the predetermined threshold and a local noise only scoring protocol is employed for those intervals having a height above the predetermined threshold. Local noise based scoring protocols of interest include those described in application Ser. Nos. 10 953 958 11 338 515 and 11 363 699 the disclosures of which scoring protocols are herein incorporated by reference. Alternatively or in addition intervals having a number of probes that falls within a predetermined range may be scored with a predetermined minimum combined noise factor. For example one may define the minimum combined noise factor range as ranging from 1 to the square root of the total number of probes on an array K . Using this range if the total number of probes of an interval k falls in the range of 1 to K then the minimum combined noise factor is employed in scoring that interval. Alternatively or in addition one may bound the total combined noise factor by an upper and or lower predetermined limit. In such situations if the empirically determined combined noise factor falls above the upper limit of the predetermined bounded range the upper limit is employed. Likewise if the empirically determined combined noise factor falls below the lower limit of the predetermined bounded range the lower limit is employed.

Various embodiments of the present invention may employ a centralization constant e.g. as described in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 338 515 the disclosure of which centralization constant based methods is herein incorporated by reference. Briefly in such methods one may determine a zero point or centralization constant for an array based comparative genomic hybridization aCGH data set by identifying a zero point value or centralization constant that when used in an aberration calling analysis of the aCGH data results in the fewest number of array probe complementary genomic sequences identified as having abnormal copy numbers with respect to a control genome or in other words results in the greatest number of array probe complementary genomic sequences identified as having normal copy numbers. In one embodiment interval based analysis of an aCGH data set may be carried out using a range of putative zero point values and the zero point value for which the maximum number of genomic sequences are determined to have normal copy numbers may then be selected.

Providing the software and instructions as a kit may serve a number of purposes. The combination may be packaged and purchased as a means of upgrading array analysis software. Alternately the combination may be provided in connection with new software. In certain embodiments the instructions will serve as a reference manual or a part thereof and the computer readable medium as a backup copy to the preloaded utility.

The instructions may be recorded on a suitable recording medium. For example the instructions may be printed on a substrate such as paper or plastic etc. As such the instructions may be present in the kits as a package insert in the labeling of the container of the kit or components thereof i.e. associated with the packaging or subpackaging etc. In other embodiments the instructions are present as an electronic storage data file present on a suitable computer readable storage medium e.g. CD ROM diskette etc including the same medium on which the program is presented.

In yet other embodiments the instructions are not themselves present in the kit but means for obtaining the instructions from a remote source e.g. via the Internet are provided. An example of this embodiment is a kit that includes a web address where the instructions can be viewed and or from which the instructions can be downloaded. Conversely means may be provided for obtaining the subject programming from a remote source such as by providing a web address. Still further the kit may be one in which both the instructions and software are obtained or downloaded from a remote source as in the Internet or world wide web. Some form of access security or identification protocol may be used to limit access to those entitled to use the subject invention. As with the instructions the means for obtaining the instructions and or programming is generally recorded on a suitable recording medium.

The nuclear genome of the cells of a plurality of cellular samples may be evaluated using the above described method. In one embodiment the method may be employed to identify deletions insertions and other chromosomal aberrations that are common to many different samples.

Arrays employed in CGH assays contain polynucleotides immobilized on a solid support. Array platforms for performing the array based methods are generally well known in the art e.g. see Pinkel et al. Nat. Genet. 1998 20 207 211 Hodgson et al. Nat. Genet. 2001 29 459 464 Wilhelm et al. Cancer Res. 2002 62 957 960 and as such need not be described herein in any great detail. In general CGH arrays contain a plurality i.e. at least about 100 at least about 500 at least about 1000 at least about 2000 at least about 5000 at least about 10 000 at least about 20 000 usually up to about 100 000 or more of addressable features that are linked to a planar solid support. Features on a subject array usually contain a polynucleotide that hybridizes with i.e. binds to genomic sequences from a cell. Accordingly such comparative genome hybridization arrays for short CGH arrays typically have a plurality of different BACs cDNAs oligonucleotides or inserts from phage or plasmids etc. that are addressably arrayed. As such CGH arrays usually contain surface bound polynucleotides that are about 10 200 bases in length about 201 5000 bases in length about 5001 50 000 bases in length or about 50 001 200 000 bases in length depending on the platform used.

In particular embodiments CGH arrays containing surface bound oligonucleotides i.e. oligonucleotides of 10 to 100 nucleotides and up to 200 nucleotides in length find particular use in the subject methods.

In general the subject assays involve labeling a test and a reference genomic sample to make two labeled populations of nucleic acids which may be distinguishably labeled contacting the labeled populations of nucleic acids with an array of surface bound polynucleotides under specific hybridization conditions and analyzing any data obtained from hybridization of the nucleic acids to the surface bound polynucleotides. Such methods are generally well known in the art see e.g. Pinkel et al. Nat. Genet. 1998 20 207 211 Hodgson et al. Nat. Genet. 2001 29 459 464 Wilhelm et al. Cancer Res. 2002 62 957 960 and as such need not be described herein in any great detail.

Two different genomic samples may be differentially labeled where the different genomic samples may include an experimental sample i.e. a sample of interest and a control sample to which the experimental sample may be compared. In certain embodiments the different samples are pairs of cell types or fractions thereof one cell type being a cell type of interest e.g. an abnormal cell and the other a control e.g. a normal cell. If two fractions of cells are compared the fractions are usually the same fraction from each of the two cells. In certain embodiments however two fractions of the same cell type may be compared. Exemplary cell type pairs include for example cells isolated from a tissue biopsy e.g. from a tissue having a disease such as colon breast prostate lung skin cancer or infected with a pathogen etc. and normal cells from the same tissue usually from the same patient cells grown in tissue culture that are immortal e.g. cells with a proliferative mutation or an immortalizing transgene infected with a pathogen or treated e.g. with environmental or chemical agents such as peptides hormones altered temperature growth condition physical stress cellular transformation etc. and a normal cell e.g. a cell that is otherwise identical to the experimental cell except that it is not immortal infected or treated etc. a cell isolated from a mammal with a cancer a disease a geriatric mammal or a mammal exposed to a condition and a cell from a mammal of the same species preferably from the same family that is healthy or young and differentiated cells and non differentiated cells from the same mammal e.g. one cell being the progenitor of the other in a mammal for example . In one embodiment cells of different types e.g. neuronal and non neuronal cells or cells of different status e.g. before and after a stimulus on the cells or in different phases of the cell cycle may be employed. In another embodiment of the invention the experimental material is cells susceptible to infection by a pathogen such as a virus e.g. human immunodeficiency virus HIV etc. and the control material is cells resistant to infection by the pathogen. In another embodiment of the invention the sample pair is represented by undifferentiated cells e.g. stem cells and differentiated cells.

Results obtained from several of such array based CGH assays may be analyzed using the methods described above to identify common aberrations.

Array comparative genomic hybridization aCGH data are obtained for two samples i.e. an 18q dilution series sample and HT29 sample using the Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray 44A aCGH system Agilent Technologies Santa Clara Calif. according to the manufacturer s instructions. Two different scoring protocols for the data are employed. The first scoring protocol is a local noise only scoring protocol employed in an aberration calling protocol identified as ADM 1 as disclosed in application Ser. Nos. 10 953 958 11 338 515 and 11 363 699. This scoring protocol is described as follows 

Finally provides a screen capture of a graphical user interface providing a comparison of aberration calls for ADM 1 and AMD 1 with global error model applied to aberrations of height less than 0.

These results demonstrate that the use of an aberration calling protocol that employs a scoring protocol based on a combined noise factor which includes a global noise component can effectively improve the results that are obtained.

Although the present invention has been described in terms of a particular embodiment it is not intended that the invention be limited to this embodiment. Modifications within the spirit of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example an almost limitless number of different implementations of computer programs and computer program routines can be created to compute the above described analysis methods for analyzing chromosomal aberrations in diseased tissue samples when a number of control samples are available. Although recursive methods may be employed more efficient non recursive algorithms can be employed to more efficiently compute the desired statistics. The above described methods can be easily modified to encompass experimental data from many different organisms having different numbers of chromosomes different numbers of subsequences per chromosome and other genetic differences. In each component of the above described method many possible mathematically similar but alternative approaches may be employed. For example different methods for computing means and variances can be used as well as different statistical parameters used to characterize particular distributions. Many different types of user interface implementations in addition to the user interface implementation discussed above with reference to can be employed to allow for convenient selection of parameters that control CGH analysis and various different CGH data analysis results display formats.
