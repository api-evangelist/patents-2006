title: Method and system for occurrence frequency-based scaling of navigation path weights among online content sources
abstract: A method and system for scaling navigation path weights among online content sources. A method may include determining a first probability of users traversing a first navigation path from a first to a second online content source, dependent upon a ratio of traversals of the first navigation path and traversals of all navigation paths to the second online content source. The method may also include determining a second probability of users traversing navigation paths from the first online content source to any of the online content sources, dependent upon a ratio of the plurality of online content sources to which navigation paths from the first online content source exist and a total number of the plurality of online content sources. The method may further include generating from the probabilities a scaling factor indicative of a strength of the first navigation path relative to other navigation paths among the online content sources.

This invention relates to computing systems and more particularly to identifying relationships among sources of computer accessed content according to usage patterns associated with that content.

As the reach and accessibility of computer networks such as the Internet increase the amount of information accessible via such networks has grown exponentially. For example as commercial enterprises increasingly embrace electronic commerce techniques numerous websites offering information and purchasing opportunities for various products and services have appeared. Major media outlets commonly provide web based versions of content previously available only through print or broadcast channels and in some instances generate considerable volumes of content exclusively for web based distribution. The reduction of cost complexity and other barriers to entry into web based content publishing has also facilitated the generation and dissemination of content by individual creators. This phenomenon is perhaps best illustrated by the increasing number and popularity of individually authored web logs or blogs which offer content in a wide range of topics styles and perspectives ranging from objective journalism to near real time autobiography.

As the amount of online content increases the difficulty of locating content that is of general or specific interest also increases. Unlike libraries which may employ standardized systems of content classification such as the Library of Congress System or the Dewey Decimal System no standard for organizing and representing web based content exists. Numerous search engines have evolved to attempt to index web pages according to the page contents e.g. as given by the textual content actually displayed by the page when loaded into a browser or client or by concealed metadata such as tags associated with or embedded within the page . Such search engines have further attempted to qualify the relevance of a given indexed page using other features of the page such as its age and or the number of links to the given indexed page from other indexed pages. For example for a given keyword search a page that satisfies the search criteria and is linked to from many sources may be considered a more relevant search result than a page having fewer external references.

Conventional index based approaches to organizing online content suffer from a number of limitations. For example such approaches are relatively static. Typical search engines gather information for indexing by crawling through web pages over periods of days or weeks which may be insufficient to capture fast moving or transient content. Further numerous sources of content may be excluded from the indexing process rendering the excluded content inaccessible to users of that search engine. For example content hosts may deliberately refuse access to web crawling tools or a host may simply be too new or insufficiently relevant e.g. according to absolute number of visitors or number of inbound links to content to warrant indexing according to a search engine s indexing policy or strategy. Thus users unaware of how to directly access excluded content e.g. via a specific Uniform Resource Locator or URL may never be able to locate it.

Moreover static indexing approaches that focus solely or predominantly on indexing content may overlook other possibly useful sources of information about content such as patterns of user behavior with respect to content. Such patterns may emerge dynamically and in real time as users interact with one another and are influenced by factors internal and external to the content with which they interact.

Various embodiments of a method and system for scaling navigation path weights among online content sources according to occurrence frequencies are disclosed. According to one embodiment a method may include determining a first probability of users traversing a first navigation path from a first to a second one of a number of online content sources where the first probability is dependent upon a ratio of a number of user traversals of the first navigation path and a number of user traversals of all navigation paths to the second online content source. The method may also include determining a second probability of users traversing navigation paths from the first online content source to any of the online content sources where the second probability is dependent upon a ratio of a number of the plurality of online content sources to which navigation paths from the first online content source exist and a total number of the plurality of online content sources. The method may further include generating a scaling factor indicative of a strength of the first navigation path relative to other navigation paths among the plurality of online content sources where the scaling factor is dependent upon a ratio of the first probability and the second probability.

In another embodiment a method may include determining a path weight corresponding to a first navigation path from a first to a second one of a plurality of online content sources dependent upon a function of content access request traffic along the first navigation path and determining a scaling factor corresponding to the navigation path such that the scaling factor is directly proportional to a first factor comprising a relative frequency of user traversals from the first online content source to the second content source compared to user traversals from any of the online content sources into the second online content source and such that the scaling factor is inversely proportional to a second factor comprising a relative number of online content sources linked to by the first online content source compared to a total number of the online content sources. The method may further include generating a scaled path weight as a function of the path weight and the scaling factor.

While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood however that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.

As noted above conventional schemes for indexing online content e.g. by exhaustively crawling through such content and statically ranking content relevance e.g. by noting the degree of connectivity to content may both overlook certain content and inaccurately represent its real interest to users. As an alternative approach the interest level of online content may be determined on the basis of actual user access to such content. For example content that is frequently requested by users e.g. via a web browser or other type of device or interface may be considered more interesting than content that that has many inbound links but few actual user requests. By associating a measure of content interest with actual user behavior relative to content content interest may be determined dynamically. Indicated content interest may then rise and fall according to content access patterns that may reflect emergent properties of a networked community of users. It is noted that in some instances the interest level of content may be a factor in or a proxy for the relevance of such content to a given user.

In some embodiments content interest associated with online content may be determined according to the behavior of users or consumers of that content as distinct from an owner or generator of the content or an agent that may attempt to access online content with no interest or intent grounded in the content itself. For example content interest may be associated with the general interest of a broad or narrow community of users for whom at least some degree of initial or continuing desire or curiosity for making use of online content is implicit in their acts of accessing such content. By contrast the actions of an owner or generator of content may not be indicative of interest in the owned or generated content per se but rather in the availability of such content for users. For example the attempts of a web site owner to access his own site s content for debugging purposes may not indicate interest in the content itself but rather some aspect of how the content appears or is conveyed. Similarly a bad actor may maliciously attempt to access online content with the intention not of using the content but of creating a deleterious effect such as a denial of service attack or a distortion of content usage metrics e.g. click fraud .

Sheer volume of user access requests to a given source of online content may not be the best indicator of interest however. For example the websites of major online retailers media outlets etc. process consistently large numbers of content requests through their home pages every day with relatively minor and or predictable fluctuations in request traffic relative to overall traffic volume. By contrast a little known website might suddenly see its traffic grow tenfold perhaps due to media coverage word of mouth etc. If content interest were purely a function of the number of content access requests the high volume site with relatively consistent request traffic would continually be ranked as more interesting than the little known site that exhibits considerable variance in request traffic. This may act to impair the discovery of new and potentially interesting sources of content. That is determining content interest solely from access request volume e.g. number of requests per hour day etc. may be biased in favor of preserving the level of interest of already highly ranked content sources at the expense of obscuring the level of interest of less requested sources.

In some cases such a bias may be overcome by defining a measure of content interest to account for a time rate of change of content request traffic rather than simply the magnitude of the content request traffic. Such a measure may be referred to interchangeably herein as a level or indication of interest as content interest or simply as interest. Considering the previous example the overall rate of change of request traffic for high volume sites may be relatively small at any given time. By contrast traffic to a little known website may exhibit a large rate of change relative to its overall traffic volume in a short period of time during a spike in traffic. By highlighting the rate of change of content request traffic the burgeoning interest in the little known website may be brought to the attention of users who otherwise may have never become aware of the content available at that site.

In the following sections the behavior of an exemplary network based system for requesting and conveying online content is discussed. Various methods for determining the level of interest of online content based on rate of change behavior of content request traffic are explored. Additionally techniques for collecting and reporting request traffic as well as displaying the resulting interest analysis of such traffic are considered and an exemplary computer system that may be configured to implement content request traffic data collection analysis and or reporting functions is discussed.

One embodiment of a system configured to facilitate the distribution of online content is illustrated in . In the illustrated embodiment a number of hosts are configured to receive requests for online content from a number of content requestors via a network . Additionally an interest analysis IA system including a web services WS interface and a traffic analysis TA engine is configured to communicate with hosts via network . As noted below in conjunction with the description of in some embodiments some or all of the components illustrated in may be partially or entirely implemented as computer executable instructions and data stored via a computer accessible medium.

Generally speaking hosts may be instances of online content sources where an online content source may encompass any suitable type of data that may be conveyed over a network including but not limited to text documents still image data page image data audio data video data metadata such as markup language tags communication protocol data such as content preambles epilogues and so forth. In many embodiments hosts may be configured to provide online content to requestors via web based data request and transport protocols. For example hosts may be configured to host web sites implementing Uniform Resource Locators URLs corresponding to web pages documents or other online content and to receive requests for access to particular URLs formatted in a version of the Hypertext Transport Protocol HTTP data transport protocol. In response to such requests hosts may be configured to access the content corresponding to the requested URL and to provide it to the requester in accordance with the HTTP protocol. It is contemplated that in some embodiments application layer data transport protocols other than or in addition to HTTP may be used to convey requests for content and the resulting content to and from hosts . For example a secure authenticated version of HTTP may be employed as may a version of File Transfer Protocol FTP or any other suitable protocol. Hereinafter an online content source may be referred to simply as a content source although it is understood that the content of a content source may be conveyed or accessed via some type of communication network.

In some embodiments a given host may be configured as a self contained standalone web server that both stores online content and receives and processes requests for stored content. In other embodiments a given host may be included within a complex content server architecture. For example host may be configured as an application or content server that does not actually store content but is instead configured to retrieve requested content from a database or other repository not shown that may not be directly connected to network .

Content requesters in general may encompass any device system or software application that may be configured to request online content. For example a requestor may include a general purpose computing system configured to implement a web browser such as a version of Microsoft Internet Explorer Firefox Opera or another suitable web browser or client application. Requestor may also include functionality defined by scripts such as JavaScript modules configured to execute in a standalone environment or an execution environment provided by a web browser. Requestor may alternatively be configured to host a syndicated content aggregator that may use a publish subscribe protocol such as RSS to notify users of the existence of new or updated online content. In some embodiments a requestor may include mobile devices such as cellular phone or wireless devices configured to request online content via embedded clients. A requestor may further encompass other types of network attached devices such as television set top boxes digital video recorders etc.

Network s may include any suitable data network or combination of networks configured for communicating content requests and online content between requestors and hosts . For example network may include one or more Local Area Networks LANs such as Ethernet networks as well as Wide Area Networks WANs Metropolitan Area Networks MANs or other data or telecommunication networks implemented over any suitable medium such as electrical or optical cable or via any suitable wireless standard such as IEEE 802.11 Wi Fi IEEE 802.16 WiMax etc. In various embodiments all or a portion of network may encompass the network infrastructure commonly referred to as the Internet. In other embodiments network may be entirely contained within an enterprise and not directly accessible from the Internet. For example network may be configured as an enterprise intranet where hosts and requestors are local to an enterprise.

Generally speaking content requestors may request and receive content from hosts via network . In some instances the pattern of such requests may be indicative of the relative interest of requested content. For example if many different requesters generate requests for one content source over a period of time while fewer requests are directed to a second content source during the same period of time the request data may indicate that the first content source is of greater interest to users than the second content source during the time period in question. As described in greater detail in subsequent sections in one embodiment IA system may be configured to receive reports of content request traffic generated by or on behalf of requesters and to perform various types of analysis on such reports. Such analyses may variously be configured to determine for example relative levels of user interest of individual content sources as well as path relationships among content sources evidenced by user navigation.

While online content hosted by hosts may often conform to a web based model in which content may be requested via URLs and delivered to a web browser or other web client this is not a requirement for the methods and techniques described below. Broadly speaking hosts may host any type of online content and may interact with requestors according to any suitable request response model to provide the hosted content. For example in some embodiments hosts may be configured as databases file systems or other types of data repositories accessible by protocols other than web based protocols.

As described above a host may receive content request traffic from various requestors that is directed to online content hosted by host . For example a host may receive HTTP GET requests directed to a particular URL or a different type of content request according to a different data transport protocol. In the illustrated embodiment hosts may be instrumented with traffic reporting logic which in various embodiments may include scripts code or hardwired logic configured to report content request traffic to interest analysis system .

In one embodiment traffic reporting logic may be configured to invoke one or more web services WS calls targeting the WS interface of IA system as the service endpoint. One embodiment of a method of operation of traffic reporting logic is illustrated in . Referring collectively to operation begins in block where content request traffic directed to online content sourced by host is detected. For example host may detect an incoming HTTP GET request specifying a given URL. In response IA system may be notified of the content request traffic via a web services call block and the reported request traffic may be stored e.g. by IA system block . For example traffic reporting logic may be configured to issue a web services call according to the following format 

where corresponds to the Internet address of WS interface in name or numeric form and where denotes the requested or targeted URL. In the illustrated embodiment two referrer URLs may also be supplied. The first referrer URL may correspond to the URL from which the request for the targeted URL originated. For example the request may have been generated by a user selecting e.g. clicking a link or otherwise executing a navigation operation on some other web page in which case the first referrer URL may include the URL of that other web page. Similarly the second referrer URL may include the URL of the site page or other resource that referred to the first referrer URL e.g. the URL that is two links previous to the targeted URL in the navigation history of the requester . More or fewer referrers may be provided in various embodiments. Also additional or different parameters may be used in the web services call in various embodiments. For example date and or time information associated with the occurrence of the content request may be embedded by the host within the web services call used to report the content request. Alternatively such information may be recorded by IA system when it receives such a report. It is contemplated that over time different hosts may report content request traffic to IA system via traffic reporting logic e.g. according to the method of . As a result over time IA system may accumulate a body of data indicative of content request traffic from many different requestors to many different content sources associated with hosts . Such data may serve as the basis for content source interest analysis and navigation path analysis as described in subsequent sections.

The additional parameter ResponseType may be used in some embodiments to return data to host from IA system . For example different values for the ResponseType may cause IA system to return data such as the top URLs referring to or from the target URL or the top URLs of all URLs known to IA system e.g. ranked according to content request traffic analysis as described below . Other ResponseType values may cause the original web services request to be echoed back to host or may cause a different response or no response at all to be returned. If URL data is returned it may be processed by host as described below in conjunction with the description of to report content request traffic and retrieve content source interest data.

It is noted that in some embodiments when a user navigates away from content on a particular host to a different content source e.g. a URL hosted by a different host the particular host may be configured to detect the outgoing transition. In some such embodiments hosts may be configured to report such outgoing content request traffic to IA system via traffic reporting logic in addition to incoming content request traffic. Since navigation away from one content source typically implies navigation towards another even if the target host is not instrumented to report content request traffic data e.g. with an instance of traffic reporting logic in some circumstances content request traffic data may still be captured by the host from which the user is navigating away.

In the example web services call shown above the specified operation AddPheromone may indicate to IA system that the supplied content request traffic information should be recorded and processed as described in greater detail below. Generally speaking recording information regarding the navigational path taken by a user to a content source e.g. the target URL as well as its referrers may be conceptually similar to an insect marking its path with a pheromone. If a sufficient number of users navigate to a particular content source through a certain set of paths those paths may be distinguished from other paths e.g. random paths via the accumulation of pheromone e.g. recorded traffic information . It is noted however that the use of the term pheromone in this context is purely illustrative or metaphorical and that some characteristics of biological pheromones may not be directly applicable to analysis of content request traffic as described herein.

It is noted that in various embodiments traffic reporting logic may be configured to invoke WS interface in any of a number of suitable ways. The example just given may be representative of a web services invocation in a Representational State Transfer REST style web services architecture. Alternatively host may communicate with WS interface using a document or message oriented architecture for example by formatting the web services request as an eXtensible Markup Language XML document encapsulating such a document using a version of the Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP and conveying the resulting encapsulated document to WS interface for processing. In either case different numbers or types of parameters for communicating information about content request traffic targeting host may be employed in various embodiments. It is also contemplated that in some embodiments hosts may communicate with interface using protocols other than web services related protocols. For example such communication may take place using protocols such as Telnet Remote Procedure Call RPC or other standard or proprietary protocols. Also in some embodiments it is contemplated that a host may combine and report information for multiple distinct content requests as part of a single web services transaction with WS interface .

An administrator of a host may integrate traffic reporting logic directly within the other functionality of host that is configured to process content requests and provide content. However in some embodiments traffic reporting logic may be configured as a self contained platform independent software module that may be downloaded remotely invoked or otherwise obtained from a third party e.g. the party providing IA system and implemented by an administrator of a host with minimal alteration to the configuration of host . For example traffic reporting logic may be implemented as a JavaScript module or a software module coded in another suitable language. Upon activation traffic reporting logic may be configured to generate the appropriate web services calls to report content request traffic to IA system in a manner that is generally transparent to the other operations performed by host . Traffic reporting logic may be implemented to have minimal impact on content request throughput. For example if traffic reporting logic cannot contact WS interface to report a particular content request the request may still be allowed to complete.

Although in some embodiments traffic reporting logic may execute on host in other embodiments it may be implemented as a module such as a JavaScript module that is delivered by host to a requestor along with the requested content. Traffic reporting logic may then be executed by the requester rather than the host in order to report the request. In other embodiments traffic reporting logic may be implemented on a proxy server that may be located between requestor and host . The general function of traffic reporting logic may be similar regardless of whether the logic is implemented for host side client side or proxy server execution.

Through the reporting of instances of content request traffic by hosts IA system may gather data indicative of both the global traffic behavior among hosts as well as traffic behavior relative to a subset of hosts or within an individual host e.g. among the different URLs hosted by a particular host . In some embodiments IA system may store each traffic report received from a host as an individual data record while in other embodiments IA system may be configured to aggregate or consolidate traffic records in various ways. For example IA system may aggregate content request traffic data into time slots according to intervals of time such as seconds minutes hours days or other suitable intervals. Those data points falling within a given time slot may be aggregated for the purposes of analysis.

In various embodiments IA system may manipulate the received URLs within content request traffic data in various ways. For example to avoid accumulating sensitive or personally identifying user data e.g. out of privacy concerns IA system may be configured to strip query parameters session information or any other potentially personally identifying information such as cookies passwords etc. from a target URL or a referrer URL e.g. by stripping any information following the first occurrence of within the URL . IA system may also be configured to transform URLs into a canonical format for example by truncating them or eliminating internal levels of hierarchy. Additionally IA system may be configured to perform unification of different URLs. In one embodiment certain different URLs may refer to content that is sufficiently similar to warrant tracking as a single content source. For example a host may be configured to dynamically generate content by augmenting existing content with personalization information before delivering the content to the requester . Alternatively a URL may reflect session or state information associated with a particular requestor that may be transparent with respect to the content actually delivered to the requestor. Unification of distinct URLs may include determining that the URLs refer to the same underlying content or subset of content and subsequently tracking the URLs as common rather than distinct. It is contemplated that in some embodiments some or all aggregation unification or other manipulation of reported URLs may be performed by traffic reporting logic within a host rather than by IA system . Further it is contemplated that content request traffic reporting aggregation and analysis may be performed at any suitable level of content granularity. For example in embodiments where content sources correspond to various URLs reporting and or analysis of content request traffic may be performed on the level of individual web page URLs site URLs or any other suitable portion of a URL obtainable by extraction truncation unification or any other type of transformation.

In some embodiments reports of content request traffic may be filtered according to various criteria before further analysis occurs e.g. a rate of change analysis as described below . For example in some circumstances a requestor may attempt to deliberately manipulate the traffic associated with a given content source by issuing spurious requests to that source. Such manipulation may be detected in a number of ways. For example a unique identifier associated with a requester such as its Internet Protocol IP addresses or another suitable identifier e.g. an irreversible hash of an IP address browser key or other suitable combination of requestor information may be tracked and requests to a content source in excess of a given threshold or pattern may be considered questionable and subsequently filtered. Alternatively collected traffic data may be filtered to remove traffic received from or directed to potentially objectionable sources such as sources of pornographic content phishing sites spamming sites or other sources complicit or implicit in the delivery of malicious or undesirable software e.g. spyware or adware . Other motivations for filtering content request traffic are possible and contemplated.

Criteria for determining when filtering should be performed may vary in various embodiments. For example as mentioned above a substantial number of content requests originating from a single requestor during a given period of time may be indicative that such requests are possibly being automatically generated. If such requests are directed to one or a small number of content sources this behavior may be suggestive of an attempt to manipulate content interest indications of those sources. More generally certain patterns of content request traffic may be identified to be suspicious or manipulative. For example if content request traffic directed to a content source from one or more requestors is highly cyclical or exhibits other predictable behavior with less variation than would be expected from a stochastic process the traffic may be considered to exhibit a manipulative pattern and therefore be a candidate for filtering. It is noted that filtering may be implemented as a heuristic process rather than a deterministic process. Accordingly in some embodiments filtering may include flagging marking or otherwise indicating suspicious data instead of permanently removing the data. In such embodiments whether or not to use suspicious data may be selected as an operating parameter e.g. by specifying a desired confidence level in the content interest weights .

The actual filtering of content request traffic may occur at a number of different points between requestor and IA system . For example IA system may be configured to store all content request traffic reports received from hosts as such reports arrive and to subsequently remove records of reports deemed to be spurious or from undesirable sources. Alternatively IA system may be configured to perform filtering as reports are received and to discard or flag questionable reports. In other embodiments traffic reporting logic may be configured to evaluate content requests for filtering and may either discard a questionable request without reporting it to IA system or may report it with prejudice e.g. by explicitly indicating that it may be questionable. In some embodiments different criteria for filtering content request traffic may be applied to different content sources according to parameters specified by users of content request traffic data including the interest analysis procedures described below . In such embodiments raw content request traffic may be filtered at the time it is retrieved or analyzed rather than when it is initially received or stored.

In one embodiment IA system may be configured to perform load shedding under certain circumstances. For example if the combination of incoming reports of content request traffic data from hosts and outgoing content interest data e.g. to badges plugins or other users of content interest data as described below exceeds a threshold volume of processing activity the performance e.g. response time of IA system may degrade. In such circumstances IA system may be configured to reduce its processing load by discarding incoming reports in order to preserve performance with respect to outgoing data or vice versa. In other embodiments other load management schemes are possible and contemplated. For example IA system may be configured to offload some of its processing tasks to other systems or may employ flow control protocols to negotiate the frequency or quantity of reporting it receives from hosts .

IA system may be configured to store received content request traffic data using any suitable format or methodology. For example IA system may store such data in arrays tables trees databases hashed structures or other suitable data structures either internal to IA system or distributed among one or several external systems not shown such as database systems file systems etc. In some embodiments IA system may store historical content request traffic data for arbitrary periods of time while in other embodiments data older than a threshold age e.g. days months etc. may be automatically purged or moved to secondary storage.

The content request traffic data collected by IA system for URLs hosted by a given host may be generally representative of request traffic behavior over time for the given host . For example the collected data may form a time series of data points corresponding to content request traffic at discrete points in time or during various intervals of time. In some embodiments IA system may be configured to use curve fitting techniques to develop an analytical function that is generally descriptive of the collected data within a certain level of error e.g. by determining coefficients of a power series or Fourier series or applying any other suitable curve fitting technique . In such embodiments parameters characterizing the analytical function e.g. polynomial coefficients may be stored in place of the collected data points themselves.

As mentioned previously in some circumstances the magnitude of content request traffic corresponding to a particular URL may not be an optimal indication of the interest level of that URL. Rather the rate of change in content request traffic may be a more effective measure for detecting emerging or developing trends in actual online content usage behavior from which changes in content interest may be inferred. Particular examples of content request traffic data illustrating this phenomenon are shown in .

In content request traffic over a period of time is illustrated for an exemplary content source having a relatively high volume of requests. For example the illustration may apply to a content source corresponding to a large popular website such as a retail website. As shown by the heavy solid line content request traffic R for the high volume source ranges between approximately 350 and 550 requests during any given interval of measurement. also illustrates the first time derivative of content request traffic dR dt. As shown by the dotted line the time rate of change of content request traffic generally falls within a range of 100 to 100 requests per unit of time.

In content request traffic R is illustrated for an exemplary content source having a relatively low volume of requests. For example this case may apply to a personal website such as a blog or personal home page. In this graph the heavy solid line indicates content request traffic. Read along the left axis content request traffic falls between 1 and 8 requests during any given interval. The first derivative of content request traffic shown by the dotted line and read along the right axis falls within a range of 7 to 7 requests per unit of time.

It is noted that in the low volume case the rate of change of content request traffic is much larger relative to overall traffic than in the high volume case. This is explicitly illustrated in where the ratio of the first derivative of content request traffic to overall content request traffic and multiplied by 100 is shown for both the low and high volume cases. As shown in the normalized rate of change of traffic of the high volume source illustrated by the solid line falls within a fairly narrow range of approximately 25 of traffic volume whereas for the low volume source illustrated by the dotted line the normalized rate of change ranges from approximately 100 to 700 of traffic volume. Thus in this example even though the high volume source experiences orders of magnitude more traffic than the low volume source the variability of traffic for the low volume source is orders of magnitude larger than the high volume case. In some circumstances this variability may be indicative of changes in interest with respect to the low volume content source that may be more significant than changes in interest for the high volume content source.

In one embodiment traffic analysis engine of IA system may be configured to perform a time rate of change analysis of content request traffic data and to determine the interest of content dependent upon such an analysis. One embodiment of a method of operation of TA engine is illustrated in . Referring collectively to operation begins in block where content request traffic directed to a content source is detected. It is noted that in one embodiment detection of content request traffic may be considered to occur when a report of content request traffic is received for analysis by IA system . For example such a detection may occur when IA system receives a report of content request traffic to a URL hosted by a host such as via WS interface as described above. In other embodiments detection of content request traffic may be considered to occur when host detects a content request or when host submits a report of a request to IA system . While in some embodiments operation of the method of may be triggered by the receipt of an individual content request traffic report by IA system in other embodiments the illustrated method may operate in response some other condition or event. For example the method may be configured to operate at periodic intervals such as once per second or with some other frequency. Alternatively the method may operate when a certain number of reports have been received possibly without dependence on time. For example after ten or some other number of reports have been received the method may operate to process the received reports in an aggregate fashion.

A first order time rate of change of content request traffic may then be determined block . For example TA engine may be configured to numerically compute the first derivative or first order difference function with respect to time of the time series of data representative of the content request traffic data. In embodiments in which traffic data is modeled using analytic curve fitting techniques determination of the time rate of change of request traffic may be performed using analytic differentiation of the continuous or discrete analytic functions comprising the data model. In some embodiments the time rate of change of content request traffic may be determined only with respect to newly received traffic data which may then be appended to historical time rate of change data that may be stored in a manner similar to the content request traffic data itself. It is noted that in various embodiments time rate of change information may be determined whenever content request traffic is detected at points in time independent of traffic detection e.g. according to a schedule or in response to other events.

In addition to or instead of determining a first order rate of change as in block higher order rates of change may be determined with respect to content request traffic data block . For example a second order derivative or difference function indicative of the time rate of change of the first order time rate of change computed in the previous step may also be determined in a similar manner. This process may be extended to generate an arbitrary number of higher order derivatives or difference functions with respect to content request traffic data. Generally speaking any rate of change of content request traffic determined with respect to time may be considered a time rate of change regardless of the mathematical order of the rate of change with respect to content request traffic.

Subsequently an indication of content interest associated with the content source may be determined where the indication is dependent upon the time rate of change of content request traffic directed to the content source block . The indication of content interest associated with a given content source may also be referred to herein as a weight or interest weight associated with the given content source. As described in greater detail below in different embodiments a weight associated with a content source may be determined dependent upon a time rate of change of content request traffic directed to that source in a number of different ways employing techniques such as normalization damping hysteresis or other types of transformations influenced by the time rate of change of content request traffic. In some embodiments multiple different weights may be determined that may be associated with different interest contexts as described below. Additionally it is noted that IA system may be configured to perform the method of for the respective content request traffic corresponding to numerous different content sources. For example IA system may implement multiple processing threads configured to concurrently process traffic data for different content sources or may process such data sequentially or in a time multiplexed fashion.

In one embodiment the first order time rate of change of content request traffic associated with a content source may be used directly as the weight of the content source. Thus for example when traffic to a content source is increasing at a rate of 1 request per second or decreasing at a rate of 0.5 requests per second its weight may be 1.0 or 0.5 respectively. In variations of such an embodiment the rate of change may be normalized to fall within a particular range e.g. between 1 and 1 according to a fixed standard of normalization or relative to rates of traffic change exhibited by other content sources. In some instances distinguishing positive rates of change may be considered more significant than distinguishing negative rates of change. For example if a limited number of content sources are selected to be highlighted or displayed in some fashion on the basis of rate of change related weighting as described in greater detail below few if any sources with negative rates of change may typically be selected. In some such cases rates of change that are less than zero may be represented with a weight of zero rather than a negative weight.

As described above with respect to in some embodiments a rate of change of content request traffic may be normalized relative to the request traffic volume from which the rate of change was determined for example by computing a ratio of the rate of change of request traffic to request traffic volume. The resulting ratio or normalized rate of change may then be used as the interest weight associated with the content source. In circumstances where there is a substantial disparity between content request traffic volume for two different content sources such as illustrated in such a ratio may more effectively highlight the magnitude of a rate of change in content request traffic relative to the volume of traffic. For example as discussed above ordinary fluctuation of traffic directed to a high volume content source may be larger in absolute terms than an unusual spike in traffic directed to a low volume content source. However relative to underlying traffic volume the ordinary traffic fluctuation of the high volume source may represent only a small fraction of its total volume whereas the spike in traffic directed to the low volume source may represent a large multiple of its total volume signaling a possibly interesting change in the content interest of the low volume source.

The rate of change of content traffic either in absolute terms or normalized relative to traffic volume may be mapped to an interest weight using any desired function such as a linear polynomial sigmoidal or other type of function. A direct mapping of the rate of change or normalized rate of change to the interest weight may be viewed as a mapping using the identity function. In some embodiments this mapping may be a stateless mapping that does not take into account a previous value of the rate of change or another variable such that a change in value of the rate of change yields some corresponding change in the corresponding weight. One embodiment of a general method of such a mapping is illustrated in . Beginning in block a time rate of change of content request traffic directed to a content source is determined for example as described above. A mapping function may then be evaluated to determine an indication of interest or weight corresponding to the content source dependent upon the rate of change of content request traffic block . For example the mapping function may be the identity function or a more complex function. The resulting weight may then be stored block . For example a weight corresponding to a given URL may be stored in a table record or other data structure associated with that URL.

In stateless embodiments where positive and negative rates of change directly and immediately influence weights of content sources the resulting weights may reflect changes in request traffic to content sources in near real time. That is the weights may nearly simultaneously reflect actual changes in request traffic as they occur subject to delays in request traffic being reported from hosts to IA system and then processed. Depending on communication latencies across network in some embodiments weights indicative of request traffic rates of change may lag actual request traffic events by times on the order of seconds or fractions of seconds. Thus weights may be highly responsive to the state of request traffic.

In other embodiments a content source weight may be determined on the basis of a rate of change of content request traffic in a manner that preserves some degree of state or history associated with the weight. For example a host may exhibit a one time change in content request traffic from a lower constant level to a substantially higher constant level over a brief period of time. Before and after the transition between the initial and final levels in this example the rate of change of content request traffic may be zero while during the transition it may be a positive large quantity. In a stateless implementation a corresponding interest weight might change e.g. to zero following completion of the transition tracking the rate of change. However the transition in traffic may hold significance for users for some time after the transition has occurred. For example the transition may be indicative of an interesting change or development in the information available at the content source such as breaking news a new product announcement etc. and this development may continue to be interesting for some time after it commences.

Generally speaking a rate of change analysis of content request traffic may detect edges or transitions in such traffic that may be indicative of events that impact content interest. It may be desirable to preserve such events with some degree of persistence beyond the transitions themselves for example in order to communicate or display the events to other interested parties. For example a transition in content request traffic may signal a change in content interest that is still pertinent to an observer some time after the change occurs.

Correspondingly in one embodiment traffic analysis engine may be configured to determine an interest weight of a content source using the current state of the weight in addition to a rate of change of content request traffic. For example in response to detecting a positive rate of change of content request traffic directed to a content source TA engine may be configured to correspondingly increase a weight of the content source as a function of the rate of change as described above. However if the rate of change should become zero or negative TA engine may be configured to apply a negative gain or decay function such as a linear polynomial exponential or other function to the weight such that the weight decreases over time by the decay function of the current weight rather than the rate of change of content request traffic.

One embodiment of a method of determining interest weights for a content source dependent upon a time rate of change of content request traffic data as well as a gain function is illustrated in . Beginning in block a time rate of change of content request traffic directed to a content source is determined for example as described above. A gain function that takes into account the current state of an interest weight associated with the content source is then selected according to the rate of change block . In some embodiments TA engine may implement different gain functions according to whether the rate of change is positive zero or negative or whether the rate of change assumes certain specific values. For example a linear or identity function may be selected if the rate of change is positive while an exponential or a different linear function may be selected if the rate of change is zero or negative. It is noted that in general a gain function may operate to either increase or decrease the interest weight to which it is applied taking into account the current state of the weight.

The selected gain function is then evaluated to determine the next state of the weight block . In some embodiments the next state of the weight may be selected from either the result of the gain function or the actual value of the content request traffic rate of change. For example whichever value minimizes the change to the weight may be selected in one embodiment. The resulting weight may then be stored for example in a table database etc. such as described above block .

A particular example showing content interest weights derived using a gain function applied to historical content request traffic rate of change data is illustrated in the data plotted in . In the illustration the normalized rate of change data shown in for the high volume and low volume content sources has been transformed into content interest weight data through the application of the function 

It is noted that by applying different gain functions and parameters to rising and falling edges detected in content request traffic e.g. as indicated by first order or higher order rates of change of content request traffic the responsiveness of an interest weight to different types of fluctuations in request traffic may be selectively tuned to be reactive or twitchy in some cases and damped or delayed in others. For example a weight may be tuned to respond very quickly to increases e.g. positive edges in request traffic but to have a much more gradual decay in response to decreases e.g. negative edges in traffic or vice versa. In particular it is noted that regardless of how the weight is tuned it may generally respond to actual fluctuations in content request traffic as they occur with minimal reporting and processing delays. This behavior stands in contrast to conventional approaches to indexing online content which generally function independently of actual request traffic e.g. using web crawling mechanisms and thus do not reflect the information implicit in that traffic. That is conventional indexing approaches may be generally characterized as pull models in which content to be indexed is identified and retrieved regardless of whether the content is actually interesting as measured by user behavior. As a consequence conventional approaches may gather and index uninteresting content and overlook potentially interesting content. By contrast the rate of change based content interest model described herein may be generally characterized as a push or demand driven model in which the interest level of a given content source need not be determined if in fact there is no interest in the given source as indicated by e.g. an absence of content request traffic data. That is rather than unconditionally gathering an arbitrary set of data and subsequently determining what part of the gathered data may be interesting as in the pull model the push model may first determine a level of content interest and then perform other functions such as those described below for content that is interesting.

Although the interest weight of a content source has been described above as being determined on the basis of a rate of change of content request traffic optionally also depending on the current weight through a gain function in some embodiments other factors may also contribute to the interest weight of the content source. For example a weight determined on the basis of rate of change information as described above may be combined e.g. in a weighted average with other measures of interest or relevance such as the volume of request traffic directed to the content source the number of static links or references to the content source from other sources or other suitable factors.

Additionally it is contemplated that other types of time based analysis of content request traffic data may be performed in some embodiments instead of or in addition to a differential analysis of a rate or rates of change of content request traffic. For example content request traffic may be integrated over a period of time to determine the basis for normalizing rates of change of content request traffic. Other techniques such as time frequency transform techniques e.g. using an appropriate version of a fast Fourier transform algorithm or discrete Fourier transform algorithm may also be applied to time series content request traffic data to transform such time series data into a frequency domain and thus facilitate extraction of frequency components of the data. Such frequency components may be amplified filtered or otherwise transformed using frequency domain techniques. The results may be used to influence the determination of interest weights for the corresponding content source.

Although the foregoing discussion describes embodiments in which interest weights may be determined with respect to individual content sources it is contemplated that similar techniques may be used to determine interest weights with respect to navigation paths among various content sources. For example one requestor may generate content access requests directed to a set of content sources A B and C in that order while another requestor may generate content access requests to these sources in the order B A C. In some embodiments such navigation paths may be detected through an analysis of the referral and destination information submitted to IA system in a report of a content access request. For example considering the exemplary AddPheromone web services call discussed above when the first requester navigates from content source B to content source C the AddPheromone call may reflect that the first referrer is content source B and the second referrer is content source A allowing the path to be reconstructed. In one embodiment IA system may be configured to detect longer paths by examining reported traffic for instances in which a destination first referrer combination of one report matches a first referrer second referrer combination of another report or vice versa.

In some embodiments once a navigation path is identified it may be treated as a locus of interest weight analysis in a manner analogous to that of individual content sources. For example a navigation path may be treated as a content source in itself in that request traffic volume along the path as well as rates of change in that traffic volume may be identified. Correspondingly interest weights may be generated for paths dependent upon determined rates of change of traffic volume along those paths.

A rate of change based interest weight of a particular content source determined as described above may be generally indicative of the interest of that content source in the context of all content sources for which weights have been obtained. That is the computed weight may be considered a global indication of interest or a global weight. However in some embodiments it may be useful to determine more than one weight for a given content source where the different weights are normalized relative to different contexts. For example a global weight of a given URL that reflects all request traffic to that URL may be useful in ranking the interest of the given URL in the broad context of all known URLs. However the interest of the given URL may also be considered within a narrower context such as those URLs falling within the same top level domain e.g. www.domainname.com or those URLs belonging to some community of interest as described below.

In some instances a content source that has one weight reflecting interest within a global context may have a considerably different weight reflecting interest within a local context. For example rate of change data for a given URL may not be particularly noteworthy on a global scale but might be maximal relative to other URLs within the same domain or other local context. Thus in some embodiments TA engine may be configured to determine both a global weight and one or more local weights for a given content source.

Local weights may be determined in different ways according to different embodiments. In the method embodiment illustrated in a local weight of a content source may be determined relative to a specific requestor or a set of requestors . That is the local weight may reflect a rate of change of content request traffic originating from one or several particular requestors rather than considering traffic from all requesters in the aggregate. In block a specific requester or set of requesters corresponding to the local weight of the content source is defined. For example a particular originating URL or domain may be specified. Subsequently content request traffic directed to the content source from the specified requestor s is detected block for example by TA engine via traffic reporting received via WS interface as described above.

A time rate of change of content request traffic originating from the specified requestor s is then determined block and a local weight may be determined based on the rate of change of content request traffic block . Both rate of change and weight determination may be performed by TA engine in a fashion similar to that of global weights described above. For example local weights may track the rate of change in content request traffic in a stateless fashion or one or more gain functions may be used to shape the response of the local weight to changes in the request traffic behavior. In particular it is noted that different gain functions may be applied to local weights versus global weights. For example a global weight of a content source may decay at a different rate than a local weight of that source. Subsequently the local weight may be stored block for example as part of a record or table along with a global weight for the content source.

As just described a local weight of a content source may be determined on the basis of a subset of content request traffic data restricted to specified requesters. In an alternative embodiment a local weight may also be determined by normalizing global weight information relative to a specified subset of content sources. For example the global weight of a given content source may be only a fraction of the maximum global weight when all content sources are considered in the aggregate. However within a particular subset of content sources such as local context or community of interest comprising a selected number of content sources the given content source s global weight might be maximal. For example a global weight of a particular blog may fall well below the median or average global weight of all content sources for which global weights have been determined e.g. including news sources retail web sites etc. . However considered within a subset of all content sources that includes all blogs or perhaps all blogs on a particular theme e.g. politics parenting technology law etc. the global weight of the particular blog may rank within the top few content sources of the subset. Deliberately normalizing weights within a specified context may simplify the comparison or ranking of content sources within that context.

One embodiment of a method of determining local weights by normalizing global weights relative to a subset of content sources is illustrated in . Beginning in block the subset of content sources is identified. For example the subset may be defined to TA engine to include all or a portion of the URLs included within a single domain or a number of URLs across different domains that fall within a community of interest. Subsequently global weights are determined for each content source according to respective rates of change of content request traffic data block . For example content request traffic reports may be collected and analyzed to determine global weight information using any of the techniques or methods described above.

Global weight information is then normalized within the specified subset of content sources to determine respective local weights for each source block . For example the global weights of the subset of content sources may be normalized relative to the maximum global weight or weights within the subset. While such normalization may be linear in some embodiments the relationships among the resulting local weights may be nonlinear with respect to the original global weights. Subsequently the resulting local weights may be stored block as described above.

Different considerations may serve to interrelate different content sources within a particular local context or community of interest for which local weights may be defined. As mentioned above in one embodiment a local context may correspond to a particular domain and some or all URLs residing within that domain may be members of the local context with corresponding local weights. In other embodiments a local context may be defined more generally in terms of content source topography. For example two URLs may reside within the same local context if they are related by a link or explicit reference from one to the other. More loosely two URLs may reside within the same local context if their domains are related at any level by a link from one to the other. A local context may be defined more broadly by extending membership to content sources that are related by intermediate links or references as opposed to direct links.

In other embodiments membership by content sources in a local context may be determined on the basis of content relationships among the content sources as opposed to topological relationships. For example the information content of a given textual content source may be characterized in some embodiments by performing a statistical analysis of words or phrases included within the source and to identify so called statistically improbable phrases that may be indicative of salient information content. For example a phrase that occurs frequently in one content source in comparison to others may be indicative of some significant or unique aspect of that content source as opposed to a generic phrase that may be common to many sources. That is it may be statistically likely to find common phrases in many content sources but statistically improbable to find phrases unique to a particular source in many content sources. In one embodiment two different content sources may be determined to be members of the same local context if their content overlaps to a specified degree even if they do not explicitly reference or link to one another. For example two content sources that have a specified absolute number or fraction of statistically improbable phrases in common may have related content and may consequently be identified as members of a common local context or community of interest.

Other suitable techniques or algorithms may be employed to determine content relationships among content sources including other types of content such as image data audio data metadata or embedded tags etc. and to identify related content sources as members of a community of interest. For example metadata tags descriptive of the type and content of different content sources may be compared to determine whether the sources are of similar types e.g. text images etc. and have similar content where a measure of similarity between two sources may be proportional to the number of tags those sources have in common for example. In other embodiments hashing or other reductive techniques may be used to generate content dependent signatures of content sources. Depending on the properties of the algorithm used to create the signature signatures of different content sources may be compared to determine a qualitative or quantitative indication of similarity among the sources.

Additionally in some embodiments the extent of a local context with respect to content sources may be defined manually. In one embodiment a user may be provided with a graphical user interface configured to display a topology of interests. For example the topology may reflect different interests by keywords or phrases and may illustrate relationships among such interests such as hierarchical or set membership relationships degrees of similarity etc. Alternatively the topology may reflect different content sources illustrating similar relationships. The user may then interact with the interface to specify the categories of interest or the particular content sources to be treated as a local context with respect to content interest weight determination. For example a user may select individual entities within the topology or may specify groups based on particular relationships e.g. all entities hierarchically beneath a given entity all entities removed from a given entity by degree N etc. . Content sources related to the user s selections may then be associated with a local context for content weight determination as described above. Regardless of the technique used to define a community of interest among content sources e.g. topological or content based techniques a hypothetical content seeker having interest in one content source generally may have a better than random chance of having interest in another content source within the same community of interest.

It is contemplated that in some embodiments an arbitrary number of local weights may be determined for a given content source using combinations of the techniques described above. For example a given content source may be a member of multiple different local contexts with a respective local weight associated with each one.

Using the various techniques described above interest analysis system may operate to generate a wealth of interest information e.g. interest weights and related data for various content sources based on content request traffic directed to those sources from requestors and reported by hosts . Interest weight information corresponding to content sources may be used in a number of different ways. For example in some embodiments a conventional search engine may be configured to use a global or local interest weight of a content source to rank the position of that content source in a listing of search results either instead of or in addition to other methods of ranking search results e.g. according to the number of static links or references to a given content source as determined by an indexing process . Specifically in one embodiment a search operation may be performed over a number of content sources for which corresponding content interest weights have been determined e.g. by evaluating a set of keywords or a formal query against the content sources. Such a search operation may be performed by a search engine application that is integrated into IA system or separate from it. Those content sources that satisfy the search criteria specified by the search operation may then be ranked according to their respective content interest weights for example in ascending or descending order according to the values of the weights. However as described above in some embodiments interest weight information may be indicative of near real time content request traffic activity and may be frequently updated to reflect changes in such activity. Correspondingly in some embodiments the use or display of interest weights may be configured to take advantage of their near real time properties.

Generally speaking content interest data may be retrieved from IA system by an application for any suitable purpose. For example an application may seek to retrieve raw content traffic reports submitted to IA system in order to perform its own analysis. Other applications may request content interest data derived by IA system such as content interest weights or information on navigation paths or aggregate paths as described below. For example as discussed below in conjunction with the descriptions of content interest information may be displayed to a user via a web page browser plugin or badge.

Generated content source interest data may be retrieved from IA system according to any suitable technique. For example in embodiments where IA system is configured to store records tables or other data structures including interest data various applications may query IA system via WS interface to retrieve interest data for a particular content source or a number of sources. Such data may include for example and without limitation the URLs or other identifiers of the content sources having the highest ranking by global interest weights the highest ranking requestors submitting requests to the host the highest ranking content sources as destinations for navigation away from host or the highest ranking content sources ranked by local weights within any local context or community of interest that may be defined as described above. Lowest ranking or intermediate ranking content sources in any of these categories may also be the subjects of interest data queries. In various embodiments the number of content sources for which interest data is returned in response to a request may be fixed or user selectable. In one embodiment WS interface may support a limited number of predefined types of interest data queries while in another embodiment a general purpose query interface may be provided for processing any desired well formed query of interest data.

While in some embodiments retrieval of interest data may be performed by applications or processes that are independent of requestors and hosts in other embodiments such retrieval may occur by a host as part of the process of reporting content request traffic data. In some cases retrieving current content source interest data in response to submitting a report of content request traffic data may enable a host to refresh a set of locally pertinent interest data without issuing a separate web services call. For example in one embodiment a host may be configured to submit a report of a content access request by invoking a web services call such as the AddPheromone call described above. Depending on the configuration of the web services call e.g. the argument provided to the ResponseType parameter of the AddPheromone call shown above when a host submits a report of a content request WS interface may be configured to return different types of content source interest data.

One embodiment of a general method of using a single web services call to report content request traffic and retrieve content source interest data is illustrated in . Operation begins in block where content request traffic is detected. For example a host may detect an HTTP GET or other type of content request from a requestor . Subsequently a web services call to report the content request traffic is formatted block . For example in a REST style web services architecture parameters needed to report the traffic may be specified in the form of parameters of an HTTP request to WS interface may be specified whereas in a document based web services architecture a text document including the parameters may be assembled. In this step the desired content source interest data to be retrieved may be specified. For example one of a number of arguments to a parameter e.g. the ResponseType parameter shown above may be specified in order to identify a particular predefined set of interest data to be returned e.g. a fixed number of top ranked content sources according to global weights . In other embodiments a free form query for selecting the desired set of interest data may be specified.

The web services call may then be posted to WS interface block and recorded and analyzed by TA engine as described above. In response IA system may be configured to retrieve the requested interest data block performing any necessary query processing or other data selection or filtering specified by the web services call. For example IA system may select records of content source interest data according to global weights or local weights for a particular local context. Subsequently the requested interest data may be returned as a result of the web services call block . For example a formatted document or stream of text containing the requested interest data may be returned to host .

Regardless of whether interest data is returned to a host in response to a content request reporting web services call or returned to a requesting third party application that is wholly independent of hosts and or requesters the interest data may be used or displayed in a number of fashions. In one embodiment as illustrated in a requestor may be configured to display retrieved interest data to users via a web browser or client. In the illustrated embodiment requestor is shown to include a web browser as well as a plugin configured to interact with browser . Generally speaking browser and plugin may be respective code modules or collections of code modules executable by requestor to provide various functions. In one embodiment browser may be any suitable type of browser software capable of retrieving and displaying online content such as web pages or other content retrieve form a host via a web based protocol. For example as mentioned above browser may correspond to an instance of Internet Explorer or another specific type of browser.

Plugin may be a software module that is configured to integrate with and augment the functionality of browser . For example plugin may interface with an application programming interface API provided by browser such that plugin operates as an extension of browser . In some embodiments plugin may be selectively downloaded and installed within browser by a user in order to obtain functionality that may not be natively supported by browser . For example plugin may be downloaded by a user from a host from IA system or from another source. As described in greater detail below in some embodiments plugin may be executable to display a toolbar or other type of user interface within a display environment managed by browser .

In the illustrated embodiment browser additionally includes badge code . As described in greater detail below badge code may be executable to display aspects of content interest data within a display environment managed by browser and or to perform other functions. In various embodiments badge code may be implemented as a JavaScript module as another type of executable code or script based module or as a static image e.g. represented in Hypertext Markup Language HTML or another type of markup language .

As mentioned above browser may be generally executable or operable to generate a display or interface with which a user may interact to request view and perform other operations with respect to online content. Likewise badge code and plugin may be executable to generate specific displays or interfaces of their own or to implement other functions not directly associated with the display of content interest data. One example of a collection of displays that may be presented to a user through the collective operation of browser badge code and plugin is illustrated in . In the illustrated embodiment a browser window that may be generated and managed by browser is shown displaying a variety of content that may include text images links to other content sources or any other suitable content arranged in any fashion within window . Additionally a content interest data display or badge is illustrated within the display area of window . Badge may be generated through the operation of badge code . Similarly window includes a toolbar which may be generated through the operation of plugin . In the following discussion a general correspondence between the executable components shown in and respective display elements shown in is assumed. However as noted below in some embodiments plugin may partially or completely subsume the functionality of badge code or vice versa and in some embodiments the functionality of either or both of plugin or badge code may be implemented separately from and without dependence on browser .

Generally speaking individual instances of badge code may be associated with respective hosts or content served by hosts and may be displayed in some fashion whenever a user accesses a host for which badge code has been implemented. Badge code may be integrated within the code or content of a particular web page served by a host or implemented such that it is downloaded activated and displayed whenever a user requests any content served by a host . In some embodiments it is contemplated that badge code may be configured to implement the functions of traffic reporting logic described above while in other embodiments traffic reporting logic may be implemented as a module distinct from badge code .

Additionally in some embodiments badge code may be configured to implement functions for locating or recruiting new sources of content for potential instrumentation with traffic reporting logic and inclusion in content request traffic data collection. In one embodiment badge code may be configured to provide a user selectable interface option such as a menu item a clickable link or banner or another suitable interface through which a user may obtain install and configure those components e.g. traffic reporting logic and or badge code needed to begin participating in content request traffic reporting. For example badge code may be configured to present e.g. via badge a selectable banner or menu item displaying a message to the effect of click here to install me on your site Upon selecting this item a user may be directed to a site offering instructions and downloadable software that may be used to instrument a host .

In another embodiment badge code may be configured to examine content request traffic arriving at and departing from its respective host in order to identify a host or domain associated with such traffic. In response to detecting arriving or departing traffic badge code may be configured to notify an administrator of the source or destination of such traffic to solicit participation in content request traffic reporting. For example badge code may extract a domain name e.g. domainname.com from a content access request and may then send an email notification to webmaster domainname.com admin domainname.com or any other typical or well known administrative address that may be included in a default list of such addresses where the notification may include instructions regarding how to participate in content request traffic reporting and or links directing the recipient to a content source including such information. In other embodiments badge code may identify candidate content sources for recruitment using other techniques. For example badge code may create lists of potential content sources derived from content request traffic directed to its respective host . Subsequently badge code or other software may be configured to examine or mine prospective content sources to determine administrative contact information e.g. a preferred contact listed on a web page the type of content available from the content source whether the content source is already instrumented with an instance of badge code and or traffic reporting logic or other relevant information regarding the prospective source.

In the illustrated embodiment badge code is configured to display via badge interest weight information and related data associated with its respective host that may be retrieved from IA system as described above. In one embodiment badge code may be executable to simply display an ordered list of content sources ranked according to the request that yielded the interest weight information. For example if the interest data for the most popular global content sources or local content sources within some local context was requested badge code may be executable to display all or a given number of those sources ranked from highest to lowest. In badge a given content source may be identified by a display of its URL an icon or a tag alias or other source name that may be assigned by the content source or specified by the user viewing the display. In some embodiments badge code may be executable to provide a user interface that allows a user to customize aspects of the display for example by specifying the type of query used to retrieve the interest data to display the amount of data to display such as the number of content sources the frequency with which the display data is updated or other display characteristics such as fonts colors styles etc.

In one embodiment badge code may be executable to retrieve and display content interest weight information that is relevant to content request traffic associated with a respective host without taking into account user specific information such as navigation history or content preferences of a user interacting with browser window on a requestor . For example badge code associated with a given host may be executable to indicate the top content sources among all hosts according to global weight the top content sources hosted by given host in particular e.g. specific URLs hosted by given host the top referrers to given host or the top content sources navigated to from given host . In some embodiments it may be desirable to keep the functionality of badge code relatively lightweight and host specific. For example the functionality of badge code may be confined to a limited feature set of display and analysis options centered on content interest data that is pertinent to a given associated host . In some such embodiments limiting the features and scope of analysis in this way may reduce the code size of badge code and consequently the time required to load content from given host as well as dependence on client specific aspects of the browser . For example minimizing the complexity and user interface requirements of badge code may facilitate the display of badge within the display environments generated by different types and versions of browsers and underlying platforms.

In contrast to one embodiment of badge code plugin may be configured to perform user specific personalization of content interest information. In one embodiment plugin may be configured as a software module that may be obtained by a user and persistently integrated within browser or as a standalone software module. As described above and shown in plugin may be executable to generate a toolbar that may be displayed within browser window for example in a reserved portion of the display area within a browser window or via a browser tab. Alternatively toolbar may be displayed separately from window as a detachable or standalone window. Plugin may be invoked as an extension to browser . Alternatively the functionality of plugin may be implemented as a separate standalone application that may execute independently of browser and may generate any suitable type of user interface including interfaces other than toolbars. In one embodiment once installed plugin may remain active throughout a user s session with a browser . By contrast in one embodiment badge code may remain active only so long as a user is viewing content associated with its respective host via browser window and may be deactivated if the user navigates away from that host.

Plugin may be configured to perform a variety of functions related to content interest data on behalf of a user. In one embodiment plugin may provide an interface through which a user may specify arbitrarily complex queries of content interest data generated by IA system . Such queries may allow a user to track the relative interest of content sources ranked within global or local contexts. As a non limiting example plugin may allow a user to receive visual or textual feedback e.g. via toolbar that is indicative of the top five globally ranked content sources as well as the top five news media stories e.g. stories from any media site and the top five sources having any relation to a specified topic e.g. patent law. As described above a user may also track relative interest of paths among sources ranked within either global or local contexts. Plugin may be executable to provide an interface that enables a user to specify how a given local context is defined for example by entering various types of metadata or keywords indicative of the local context.

As noted above interest data may be collected and updated by IA system in near real time as changes in content request traffic occur among various hosts . For example plugin may cause the data displayed via toolbar to be refreshed at regular intervals e.g. at intervals of five or ten seconds or upon the request of a user. In some embodiments plugin may be configured to highlight the evolution of interest data over time. For example rather than simply display an ordered list of content sources according to interest data plugin may be configured to cause the content sources to be displayed in display formats that are directly influenced by interest data. In one embodiment the size or color of the text or icon used to display a particular content source within toolbar may vary as its corresponding interest data changes. For example if the global weight of a displayed content source increases or decreases over time the size of the font used to display the name of the content source may correspondingly increase or decrease. In some embodiments different display characteristics may be used to simultaneously display different aspects of interest data for a given content source. For example font size may correlate to changes in global interest weights while font color may correlate to changes in local interest weights. Other uses of display characteristics to convey evolving content source interest data are possible and contemplated. Further detail regarding such uses may be found in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 186 357 filed Jul. 21 2005 and entitled Displaying Links at Varying Levels of Prominence to Reveal Emergent Paths Based on User Interaction. 

One example of a type of content interest data display and its evolution over time is illustrated in . Such a display may variously be generated by plugin or badge code and displayed via toolbar or badge respectively. In other embodiments such a display may be generated and displayed by other components. For example content interest data may be dynamically displayed by a host as a web page directly accessible by a user via browser without need of badge code or plugin .

In one embodiment the components and techniques described hereinabove may be implemented within a large enterprise that creates and manages a substantial degree of online content in to track content interest weight information for example as part of an enterprise resource management or knowledge management process. illustrate the top destinations within the enterprise ranked according to interest weights determined as described above at three points in time separated by several minutes. For example the top ranked content source varies over this relatively short period of time between several phone directory entries and the Wiki Wiki Home content source which may correspond to e.g. an online repository of documentation that may be collaboratively maintained by users. As shown the display may include an indication of the interest weight of a particular content source as well as a link or URL associated with the content source. In some embodiments each link may be an active link such that a user selecting the link may thereby navigate to the indicated content source. In the illustrated embodiment two weights are illustrated for each URL. The first weight indicates a total weight which may be determined as a function of a most recently calculated rate of change of content access request traffic as well as earlier calculated rates of change e.g. using a decay model as described above with respect to . The second weight indicates a weight during a most recent interval of time such as may be determined from a most recently calculated rate of change without accounting for earlier calculated rates of change. In the illustrated embodiment URLs are ranked according to the total weight. In other embodiments however content interest weights may be determined according to different functions of rates of change of content request traffic and more or fewer weights may be displayed. Further URLs may be ranked differently e.g. according to most recent weight instead of total weight .

Additionally in the illustrated embodiment each indicated content source includes a drilldown link that a user may select to obtain more information regarding the content request traffic associated with a particular content source. One embodiment of a display of such traffic data is illustrated in . In the illustrated embodiment content request traffic information is shown for the content source Wiki Wiki Home that appears as the top ranked destination in the display of . The drilldown display shows content source and corresponding interest weight information for those content sources that are destinations from the Wiki Wiki Home content source and those content sources that are referrers to the Wiki Wiki Home content source. As shown users may arrive at this content source from a number of different referral paths and may proceed to a number of distinct destinations from this content source. In addition to or instead of generating a graphical or textual display that responds to events relating to content interest data plugin may also be configured to support various other types of user notification in response to such events. For example a user may specify one or more notification criteria such as a threshold weight of a content source with respect to a global or local context or some other criteria. If a content source satisfies the notification criteria plugin may be configured to notify a user by displaying an alert on a display device e.g. displaying a dialog box or other type of interface on a computer monitor or other graphical interface that displays browser window or sending an electronic mail email or an instant message IM to an email or IM address specified by the user. In other embodiments plugin may be configured to place a telephone call or send a text message or numeric page to a device specified by the user. Plugin may also be configured to generate notifications using a publish subscribe or syndication protocol such as a version of the RSS Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary and to convey such notifications to a browser news aggregator or other RSS application which may generally include any application capable of receiving such RSS notifications and acting in response to them e.g. to display content or convey its own notifications to users.

Plugin may support other types of user personalization or customization with respect to content interest data. In one embodiment plugin may be configured to provide notifications or recommendations of potentially interesting content on the basis of a user s expressed interests the user s navigation history among content sources or extrapolation of interest from content sources themselves. For example a user may provide a list of keywords e.g. by manually entering keywords by selecting keywords from a predefined list etc. indicative of content types or topics in which the user is particularly interested. Plugin may use such keywords as a basis for creating local contexts or otherwise filtering content interest data in ways that are likely to detect content of specific interest to the user. Plugin may also be configured to analyze a navigation path among content sources traversed by a user and as described above to identify other possibly interesting content sources that may fall in or along such a path according to collected content request traffic data. Additionally plugin may be configured to extract content identifying information such as keywords content metadata statistically improbable phrases or other such information from a content source a user has previously requested e.g. a web page currently or previously viewed by the user . Plugin may use such extracted information or any other information gathered from user navigation or otherwise collected from a user in conjunction with content interest data to identify and suggest content sources of potential interest to a user. Plugin may be further configured to display notifications or recommendations regarding potentially interesting content via toolbar or via any of the notification techniques described above.

As noted above in some embodiments content interest data may be available for use or display by badge code plugin or other software or hardware with minimal delay following content request traffic events that may influence content interest data. That is content interest data may be available for processing in near real time relative to the actual occurrence of content request traffic. However in some embodiments historical content interest data may also be processed and or displayed. For example a user may not be able to view near real time content interest data for a period of time e.g. hours or days owing to other activities. When the user is once again available to view content interest data he or she may be interested in learning not only what content is currently of possible interest but what changes in content interest may have transpired during the previous period of time.

In one embodiment plugin may include an interface that allows a user to access historical content interest data in various ways. For example a user may interact with plugin e.g. via toolbar to query historical content interest data e.g. as stored by IA system for any content sources that would have satisfied interest notification criteria over a period of time. In other words a user may effective apply a set of current notification criteria intended to notify the user in near real time as described above should a content source satisfy the criteria against historical content interest data. In applying such criteria against historical data plugin may generate a highlighted display of interesting content for which notification would have occurred had the user been available to receive it. In another embodiment rather than retrieve and retroactively analyze historical content interest data from IA system plugin may be configured to store a history of content interest data notifications etc. as they occur over a period of time. For example in addition to or instead of conveying a notification to a user plugin may store a notification and possibly other data such as timestamp information for later review by the user. Plugin may implement various interface options through which a user may interact with historical content interest data. For example via toolbar plugin may enable a user to scroll the contents of a graphical display e.g. a plot of a content interest weight backwards and forwards through historical time to illustrate changes in the data over time. Plugin may alternatively store a list of content sources e.g. URLs identified as interesting which may be displayed in historical order in ranked order according to relative level of interest alphabetically etc.

It is also contemplated that historical analysis of content interest data may be employed over longer timeframes. In one embodiment plugin or other software or hardware may be configured to analyze content interest data over arbitrary periods of days weeks months etc. in order to detect patterns or trends in the data. For example content interest data may be mined for correlations between changes in interest of a given content source and other factors such as the type of content of the content source access behavior of similar or competing content sources or other emergent trends.

Although embodiments of plugin and badge code have been described as having distinct functionality it is contemplated that in some embodiments badge code may be configured to implement some or all of the features of plugin or vice versa. It is further contemplated that functionality for processing and display of content interest data may be implemented using a different partitioning or architecture. For example various display and notification functions may be divided among different components rather than implemented as a single plugin or badge. In one embodiment processing and display functionality for content interest data may be built into a website for direct viewing and interaction via browser without need of plugin or badge code . Some applications may process content interest data independently of browser . For example some of the data mining or other post processing activities mentioned above may be implemented by one or more standalone applications configured to directly retrieve content interest data from IA system using appropriate web services calls database queries or other interface approaches. In one embodiment a search engine may be configured to employ content interest data to rank search results analogous to the manner in which conventional indications of relevance may be used. For example a content source having a higher global or local weight may be ranked higher within a set of search results than another content source having a lower global or local weight. As mentioned above it is contemplated that in some embodiments content interest data may be used in conjunction with other data e.g. relevance data to perform such a ranking.

In one embodiment an application may be configured to place advertisements within online content dependent upon content interest data. For example conventional placement of an advertisement within online content may depend upon whether the content matches a keyword profile associated with the advertisement. However like a conventional measure of relevance described above such a conventional placement does not take into account rates of change of content request traffic associated with the content in which the advertisement is placed. By contrast in a system configured to determine content interest weights as described hereinabove more sophisticated advertising placement may be possible. For example rather than being statically bound to a given content source an advertisement may be selectively associated with different content sources as their relative interest changes such that the advertisement is persistently associated with a content source having at least a threshold level of interest. Additionally the cost charged for advertising placement may be associated with the desired interest level of the content sources targeted for placement. For example the highest rates may be charged for placement on content sources having the highest interest weights either globally or in a local context.

In embodiments where content interest data is computed for navigation paths among content sources instead of or in addition to traffic directed to a single content source advertising placement may also be performed dependent upon the interest level of a path navigated by a user. For example as described above user navigation among sources may be used to suggest or recommend other content sources of potential interest to the user. Similarly such navigation path information may be used to determine advertisements that may be particularly compatible with a user s interests. In some embodiments it is contemplated that content interest data may be used in conjunction with keywords or other content data or metadata to perform advertising placement.

As described in detail above in some embodiments request traffic activity directed to a given online content source may be used as the basis for deriving metrics indicative of the relative interest of the given online content source to users as reflected by actual user activity. Frequently a given content source may exist within a network of relationships defined by user navigable references or links to other online content sources. For example a content source may encompass a web page that includes links e.g. encoded as HTML links or other navigable link types to other web pages or to images audio content executable files application data files or any other suitable type of content source. When a given link is selected or otherwise activated by a user e.g. through the user clicking on or hovering over the link the user may be presented with the requested content associated with the referenced link. For example a new web page may appear in a user s existing browser or within a new browser window a download may commence a suitable application for processing data referenced by the link may be activated e.g. a reader application for a particular data format such as the Portable Document Format PDF or any other suitable activity related to the presentation of requested content.

It is noted that references among content sources need not be limited to links among web pages. In some embodiments a user may generate a reference between two content sources by virtue of some action or activity within the context of one content source that targets the other content source. For example a user may interact with a web page content source to select portions of the page s content e.g. phrases or keywords . Subsequently the user may copy the selected portions into a search function of toolbar or into a browser displaying an interface of a web page and may perform a search based on the copied content portions. In one embodiment if a user selects a content source resulting from the search operation a reference may be generated between the original content source from which search terms were retrieved and the selected content source resulting from the search even though no direct navigation link may exist between these two content sources and even though the reference may have been mediated by another application or entity e.g. a search engine . For example plugin may be configured to retain state information e.g. a URL regarding the content source from which the user has selected search terms and may use such state information to generate references to selected content sources resulting from a search operation.

References among content sources may also include references to RSS content syndication feeds web services feed sources or other sources of structured data e.g. XML or other content sources that may be rendered processed or displayed using tools or applications other than web browsers. References may also exist between dissimilar types of content sources accessible via different types of client applications. For example a user may navigate a reference from an email content source which may be displayed via an email client to a web page content source displayed via a browser distinct from the email client. It is contemplated that references arising through indirect types of content usage or navigation e.g. as described in the previous paragraph as well as navigation relationships among heterogeneous content source types and applications are encompassed in the discussion that follows.

A user s selection or activation of a reference to a destination content source and consequent presentation of the destination content source to the user in response to the selection may be referred to as user navigation to the destination content source. Similarly the user s act of selecting or activating the reference may be referred to as traversal of the reference. If a navigable reference directly relates two content sources a navigation path or simply a path may be said to exist between the related content sources. A sequence of paths in which the destination of one path functions as the origin of another path may be referred to as an aggregate path. A collection of content sources may present a variety of navigation paths and aggregate paths for a user to navigate from one content source to another. For example a first content source may link to a second which in turn links to a third and so forth. These relationships among content sources may be represented as a network or graph of which one embodiment is illustrated in .

In the illustrated embodiment network is shown to include a number of content sources . Content sources may encompass for example any of the various types or configurations of online content sources discussed previously. Paths relating different content sources are shown as directional arrows between the related sources. Thus for example paths exist between content source and content sources . By contrast no direct path exists between content source and content source although a user might navigate between these content sources via content source . In some instances where one path exists from a first source to a second e.g. a destination source another path or paths may also exist that lead from the second content source back to the first content source either directly or via some other content source . Consequently it is possible that cycles may exist within network although for simplicity of exposition these are not shown in the illustrated embodiment.

It is noted that network may represent relationships between content sources at the level of content navigation. The paths shown in network may or may not correspond to communication network relationships among systems that may be configured to host content sources . For example two content sources may be adjacent in network if one refers to the other via a navigation path. However the systems hosting the adjacent content sources may in fact be quite distant in terms of geography or communication network topology. Conversely systems that are close in terms of geography or communication network topology may be distant in terms of the content navigation topology of network . Thus in some embodiments the navigation path topology represented by network may differ or diverge from the topology of the underlying communication software and or hardware entities through which content sources may be implemented.

It is further noted that in some embodiments the relationships represented within network need not be constrained to explicit navigation links e.g. HTML links encoded within content sources. That is as described previously a reference between two content sources may be generated on the basis of usage patterns that may not involve the traversal of explicit links. As in the example mentioned previously in some instances a reference may be generated indirectly or obliquely by virtue of using one content source as a source of search terms through which another content source may be selected. Generally speaking the relationships represented within network may reflect any of the various ways in which users may navigate among content sources irrespective of whether explicit navigation links are employed. Correspondingly in some embodiments the topology of content source navigation relationships represented by network may differ from the topology of explicit navigation links included within content sources themselves in addition to differing from the topology of lower levels of resource implementation.

A representation of network may be constructed in a variety of ways. In one embodiment the structure of network may be derived through analysis of content sources to identify references to other content sources . For example a given web page may be identified as a particular content source and each of its links identified as paths to other content sources . In turn web pages targeted by these paths may be analyzed to identify their links to other content sources . The structure of network may thus be mapped through iteration or crawling through a collection of content sources .

Crawling through content sources may identify the various possible paths within network irrespective of whether any user has actually navigated those possible paths. That is it may offer a representation of network that is driven by syntax rather than usage. In other embodiments the structure of network may be identified through an analysis of actual user requests for content. For example as described above content access requests including referral information may be reported to IA system . Such requests may arise in a number of ways such as a user selecting a link explicitly represented in another content source entering a URL directly into a browser window or in any other suitable fashion. If the reported content access request targets a valid content source it may be indicative of a path from the referring content source to the requested content source . Correspondingly records of reported content access requests may be analyzed to identify such paths and to construct a corresponding representation of network . Such a usage driven representation of network may not represent every possible navigation path that exists among content sources . Rather it may represent only those paths for which an actual traversal by a user has been reported. This effective filtering by usage may result in a more compact representation of network and as described below may facilitate various types of analysis that may be performed on network . However it is contemplated that either of these approaches or any other suitable technique may be employed to generate a representation of network .

Generally speaking a representation of network may encompass any suitable data structure such as a table tree etc. In some embodiments the representation may be generated and stored by code executable on IA system . However in other embodiments a representation of network may be generated and stored by code executing on one or more of hosts or requesters for example as a component of traffic reporting logic plugin badge code or as a distinct code module or element. It is contemplated that any use of or operation on a representation of network such as any of the various types of analysis or use described below may also be implemented by code configured to generate and store the representation and may be executable by various systems as just described. Alternatively such application code may be implemented by a distinct code module or element that may be configured for execution on a system distinct from the system that generates the representation. For example in one embodiment IA system may be configured to generate a representation of network and to convey the representation to a requester which may be configured to independently execute code implementing algorithms to analyze or process the representation on behalf of a particular user. In some embodiments it is contemplated that IA system may be configured to generate the representation of network from content request traffic generated by requestors and processed as described above with respect to . For example a content request traffic report including a destination content source and a referrer may be indicative of a user navigation path between the indicated referrer and destination. In one embodiment IA system may be configured to analyze such relationships in order to infer the structure of network from content request traffic.

As mentioned above and shown in numerous paths may exist within network . However different paths may vary sometimes substantially with respect to various measures of path usage. In some embodiments a representation of network may include indications of weights along the paths between content sources where the weights may reflect any suitable measure of usage or activity of the corresponding path. For example paths between certain content sources may be traversed by a high volume of different users relative to paths between other content sources . In one embodiment a measure of navigation volume of a path such as a number of path traversals per unit of time may be assigned as a weight of that path. Alternatively some paths through network may exhibit a substantial rate of change relative to other paths. Correspondingly in one embodiment a time rate of change of the number of traversals of a given path may be assigned as a weight of that path.

It is contemplated that in some embodiments path weights may be determined as functions of various factors. In some embodiments path weights may be determined according to corresponding path navigation traffic. In some particular embodiments path weights may be determined according to a time rate of change of traffic along the corresponding paths although a time rate of change need not necessarily be employed. It is noted that all of the foregoing discussion regarding generation and behavior of content source interest weights may apply analogously to navigation path weights. In some embodiments navigation path traffic volume and a rate of change of navigation path traffic volume may each contribute to a portion of a given path weight in a linear or nonlinear fashion. Also like interest weights of content sources described above path weights between content sources may exhibit decay over time such that in the absence of navigation activity along a path the path s weight may approach or achieve a minimum value. It is noted that like content source interest weights path weights may have an arbitrarily complex functional definition. However without loss of generality simple integer weights generally indicative of path navigation traffic will be used to simplify the following discussion. That is larger numbers may be indicative of a greater degree of traffic weighted rate of change of traffic etc. while smaller numbers may be indicative of lesser degrees of traffic. As an example the network of is reproduced in with path weights.

For users of a given content source path weight information may be used in generating navigation recommendations from the set of content sources immediately referenced by the given content source . For example referring to path weights may be used to rank the paths from content source in decreasing order such that content source ranks highest followed by content sources and . Thus a user of content source may be offered such a ranked list as a set of recommendations e.g. via toolbar or badge as described above. It is noted that a ranking of content sources according to path weights from a particular content source may differ from the ranking of content sources according to global interest weights as described above. For example a global interest weight of a content source may take into account request traffic to that content source without regard for its origin while path oriented weights take into account origins and destinations of request traffic.

While ranking path weights of immediately referenced content sources relative to a given content source may offer valuable feedback to users regarding their navigation options additional recommendations regarding potentially interesting content sources may be derived by extending path ranking and evaluation to aggregate paths of network . Typically a user interacting with a given content source may have little visibility into that portion of network that extends beyond the content sources immediately referenced by the given content source . For example if content sources of correspond to web pages a user interacting with content source may see only links to content sources . As network shows other potentially interesting web pages may lie beyond these immediate pages but they are effectively hidden from the perspective of the user.

In some embodiments aggregate paths through network may be identified and ranked according to aggregate path weights. Such a ranking may be used for example to provide feedback to users regarding potentially interesting content sources that are topologically distant from content sources with which such users may be currently interacting e.g. more than one navigation path removed from a currently used content source . Further in some circumstances it may be the case that the interest or value to a user of a particular set of content sources may be enhanced if those sources are traversed in a particular order via a particular aggregate path. That is in some cases interest associated with a group of content sources may be state dependent. For example a user seeking to visit web pages to learn about a novel subject may benefit more from visiting more general introductory pages first followed by pages that address the subject in greater detail. This type of state dependence may be reflected in path weight information. For example an aggregate path between two content sources in one direction may have a higher aggregate weight than a corresponding aggregate path in the reverse direction.

Generally speaking an aggregate path weight may be determined according to any suitable function of the individual weights corresponding to the navigation paths comprising the aggregate path. For example an aggregate path weight may be determined by simply summing the weights of the aggregate path s components. However more sophisticated functions may be employed. In one embodiment the influence of individual path weights in an aggregate path weight may decay as navigation paths become more topologically distant from the origin of the aggregate path. For example decay may be defined according to a step function where only the first N navigation paths weights are included in the aggregate path weight a linear decay function an exponential decay function or any other suitable function or combination thereof. It is noted that the decay of path weight influence according to topological distance may be orthogonal to the decay of path weights themselves over time. Either technique may be employed independently or in combination. Generally speaking like navigation path weights aggregate path weights may also correspond to time rates of change of navigation traffic volume in a manner similar to the time rate of change based content interest weights described previously.

Multiple aggregate paths may exist between any two content sources within network . For example in the embodiment shown in there are fifteen distinct aggregate paths between content sources and . In the following discussion an aggregate path may be denoted by concatenating the suffix letters of the content sources traversed by the path. Thus for example the aggregate path traversing content sources and may be referred to as path ABFHK.

As mentioned previously some aggregate paths may have greater potential interest or utility to a user than other aggregate paths as indicated by corresponding aggregate path weights. In one embodiment a particular aggregate path between two content sources may be selected such that its aggregate path weight satisfies an optimization criterion That is the selected aggregate path may be distinguished from other aggregate paths on the basis of some aspect of its aggregate path weight. In various embodiments different types of optimization criteria may be employed taking account the format in which weights are represented as well as the overall goal of the selection. For example an optimization criterion may specify that the selected aggregate path should have a weight that is maximal relative to other aggregate path weights. However in other embodiments an optimization criterion may alternatively specify for example that the weight of the selected aggregate path should be minimized relative to other aggregate path weights or should have a weight that is closest among other aggregate path weights in absolute terms to some target weight value or which equals the target weight value within an absolute or relative threshold of equality e.g. an absolute weight value or a percentage of the target weight value .

Thus for example in an embodiment where higher aggregate path weights indicate greater overall user traffic rate of change of user traffic or another metric of content interest a best aggregate path among a group of aggregate paths in terms of potential content interest may correspond to the aggregate path having the highest aggregate path weight while the worst aggregate path may have the lowest aggregate path weight among the group. For simplicity of reference an aggregate path selected such that it satisfies an optimization criterion may be referred to as an optimal aggregate path or simply an optimal path regardless of the good or bad valence of the optimization criterion. Further it is noted that the notion of a path being best worst or optimal in some other regard may be a context dependent relative consideration rather than an absolute global determination. For example what constitutes a best or worst path may vary depending on the metrics that form the basis for path weighting and the desired goal resulting from selection on the basis of an optimization criterion. Additionally in some instances multiple aggregate paths may satisfy a given optimization criterion. For example a threshold aggregate path weight may be employed such that any aggregate path having a weight exceeding the threshold may be considered optimal. Alternatively aggregate paths may be ranked by weight with a given number of top paths being considered optimal. In other embodiments if multiple aggregate paths are deemed optimal according to the optimization criterion in use further filtering or optimization of these aggregate paths may be performed on the basis of secondary optimization criteria such as path length secondary measures of traffic volume or other criteria that may be relevant in distinguishing levels of content interest.

Determining which aggregate path or paths between two content sources satisfy a given optimization criterion relative to a set of possible aggregate paths within network may be a computationally nontrivial task. In some instances an optimal aggregate path may not include a given or even any locally optimal navigation path between a given pair of content sources . For example according to one embodiment path ACEJK of has an aggregate path weight of 15 and is the optimal path between content sources and within network . However it is noted that even though path ACEJK is optimal in this context the navigation path between content sources and has a higher weight than the navigation path between content sources and which is included in the optimal path. Thus determining an optimal aggregate path may not simply be a function of choosing the optimal individual navigation path at each level within network .

In some embodiments an optimal aggregate path may be identified by exhaustively computing the aggregate path weights for each possible aggregate path and then ranking the resulting weights according to an optimization criterion. However the total number of aggregate paths may grow exponentially as the number of content sources within a network increases. Thus an exhaustive search may be computationally expensive for large networks . Alternatively any suitable algorithm for determining an optimal path through a weighted network such as a Viterbi algorithm for example may be employed. One embodiment of a method of determining an optimal aggregate path between two content sources is illustrated in . In some embodiments such a method may be implemented by IA system and performed on a representation of a network derived from reported content request traffic as described above. In the illustrated embodiment operation begins in block where a trellis representation of network is generated. Generally speaking a trellis representation of a network may be include multiple levels indicative of the number of navigation paths required to reach a content source according to a particular aggregate path. Content sources that are accessible via multiple aggregate paths of differing lengths may appear in multiple levels of the trellis.

One example of a trellis representation of network of with respect to aggregate paths between content sources and is shown in . In the illustrated embodiment level includes those content sources accessible via aggregate paths including one navigation path from content source level includes those content sources accessible via aggregate paths including two navigation paths and so forth. For example content source appears in both level and level because according to network it is accessible from content source both directly and via content source . For clarity the navigation path weights shown in are not shown in the trellis of but may be encoded within a data structure representative of the trellis.

Referring again to following generation of a trellis representation operation continues in block where the optimal aggregate path to each of the content sources occupying the first level of the trellis are determined and stored. By definition there exists only one respective path from the origin content source content source in to each of the content sources occupying the first level of the trellis so this respective path is the optimal path to the corresponding first level content source .

If another level exists within the trellis block then an optimal aggregate path is determined and stored for each content source within that level block and processing may continue from block . If no additional levels exist within the trellis processing is complete with the optimal aggregate paths to each content source at each level of the trellis having been determined and stored block . In some instances network may include cyclic paths in which a given content source appears multiple times. In some embodiments the method of may be modified to detect and exclude cycles from the optimal aggregate path analysis. For example if a path is determined to be cyclic processing of the path may halt and it may be eliminated from the trellis. Alternatively cyclic paths may be excluded from trellis generation prior to the determination of optimal aggregate paths. Also in some embodiments processing of optimal aggregate path information for a given path may terminate before the final level of the trellis has been reached. For example a path may be considered terminated if a navigation path weight along the path falls below a particular threshold value.

In determining the optimal aggregate path for a given content source within a given level one or more content sources in the previous level may have paths to the given content source . However only the previously determined optimal aggregate path for each of these content sources in the previous level needs to be taken into account. That is for any given content source in some level of the trellis one or more content sources in the previous level may have a path to the given content source . In turn each of these content sources in the previous level may have multiple different paths from the origin content source . However only some of these multiple paths may be optimal and the optimal aggregate path to a content source in a succeeding level will be an extension of an optimal aggregate path to some content source in a previous level.

As an example consider . In level of the trellis the optimal paths for content sources are simply the paths from content source having weights of 5 1 and 2 respectively. In level of the trellis only content source has two possible paths from level path BF and path CF. Since paths BF and CF have respective weights and in one embodiment the aggregate path weights for aggregate paths ABF and ACF taken as the sum of the component navigation paths are 6 and 5 respectively. Since aggregate path ABF has the higher weight it may be considered the optimal aggregate path to content source in level and stored as such.

Considering level of the trellis content source has three possible paths from level paths BG EG and FG. In the illustrated embodiment only one aggregate path exists through each of content sources and in level paths ACB and ACE respectively. While two aggregate paths exist to content source path ABF was previously determined to be the optimal one of the two. Thus path ACF may be disregarded in considering the optimal path to content source in level reducing the overall computation requirement relative to the exhaustive path evaluation approach mentioned above. Based on these considerations the candidate aggregate paths to content source are paths ACBG ACEG and ABFG having aggregate path weights and respectively. Since aggregate path ABFG has the highest weight of the three it is stored as the optimal path to content source in level .

It is noted that in some embodiments thresholds decay or other functions may be applied to aggregate paths and their associated weights during the operation of the method of . For example aggregate path lengths may be explicitly limited to a certain number of navigation paths which may be implemented by limiting the number of levels of the trellis that may be considered. Alternatively a minimum path length requirement may be enforced. Additionally decay functions may be applied to individual navigation path weights within the trellis as a function of the level of the trellis where the weight occurs or according to any other suitable function. Any combination of these techniques may also be employed.

Once complete application of the method of may result in a data structure that reflects the optimal aggregate paths from an origin content source to each content source at each level within the trellis. If a given content source appears in more than one level e.g. content source appears within levels and of the overall optimal aggregate path to that content source may be determined from among the several computed entries. For example the most heavily weighted longest or shortest path to the given content source may be selected or another selection criterion may be employed. In some embodiments the optimal aggregate path from the origin content source to any content source within network may also be explicitly identified. That is rather than identifying an origin content source a particular destination content source and using the optimal aggregate path results to determine the optimal aggregate path between them the optimal aggregate path results may be used to determine which destination content source or sources have an optimal aggregate path from the origin relative to all the content sources within network .

Optimal aggregate path information may have several applications. It is noted that in general individual and aggregate path weight information may be derived from actual user navigation behavior with respect to content sources . Aggregate path information that takes user driven behavior into account may serve as an indication of interest in the content sources referenced by the path. Thus instead of or in addition to recommending specific content sources to users in some embodiments plugin badge code or both may be configured to identify and display optimal aggregate path information via toolbar and or badge .

For example in one embodiment plugin may be configured to identify a content source that a user is currently viewing or otherwise interacting with via browser window . Plugin may then query optimal aggregate path information which may be determined by and or stored on IA system one of hosts or one of requestor . For example plugin may query for a URL or other identifier of the current content source and may specifically request optimal aggregate path information relative to the current content source . Such information may include a request for aggregate paths within an interest space described in greater detail below defined by user preferences user session information or other user specific state information. In response plugin may receive information identifying one or more aggregate paths that satisfy the request which may include URL tag or other information identifying the content sources included in the paths as well as the ordered relationship among them. Plugin may then be configured to display the received path information via toolbar for example as a list of recommended paths in addition to or instead of the recommended sources shown in . Similarly in some embodiments badge code may be configured to perform similar aggregate path information requesting and display e.g. for paths that refer to or from the host that may be associated with badge .

As mentioned above in some circumstances an ordered traversal of an aggregate path may be significant to a user s deriving maximum utility from the content sources along the path. In other circumstances a user may be more interested in navigating directly to a content source that is at or near the end of an optimal aggregate path or somewhere along the path bypassing some intervening sources along the way. For example a user may begin a general search for information at a particular content source with a specific goal in mind. The various aggregate paths originating at the particular content source may be projections towards content sources that might satisfy the user s goal. That is those aggregate paths might constitute predictive information regarding destination content sources that might be useful to the user. Correspondingly in some embodiments plugin or badge code may be configured to employ aggregate path information to make specific content source recommendations for example within toolbar or badge .

It is noted that in some embodiments path weight information and consequently optimal aggregate path information may evolve over time for example as user traffic patterns change weights decay etc. It is also noted that dynamically exposing path information derived from user traffic information may facilitate self organization of an otherwise chaotic or disorganized collection of content sources . For example users presented with dynamic indications of potentially interesting paths may be more likely to select content sources along those paths which may reinforce the weighting of those paths still further. By contrast paths or content sources that become less interesting or relevant may correspondingly see their weights decline over time becoming less likely to be selected by users presented with dynamic path information. In particular it is noted that such organization of content may in some instances be entirely driven by user behavior and may be performed e.g. by software executable by IA system or another system without need of manual intervention to rate or rank content sources or paths.

One embodiment of a user interface through which a user may interact with content source interest information path information or both is illustrated in . In various embodiments the illustrated interface may be implemented as a web page viewable within a browser window such as browser window or as content presented to the user via badge or toolbar or through any other suitable display interface.

In the embodiment of display interface includes indications of five different content sources. In one embodiment each of the indicated content sources may correspond to an online content source accessible through a URL path name or other suitable descriptor. In such an embodiment the displayed indications corresponding to the content sources may be configured as hyperlinks such that a user s selection of a particular hyperlink may cause the user to navigate to the corresponding content source for example by displaying the selected content source within an existing browser window opening a new browser window to display the selected content source etc. In an alternative embodiment each of the indicated content sources may correspond to a path such as a navigation path or an aggregate path as described above. In some such embodiments the displayed content source indications may be comprised of multiple distinct hyperlinks corresponding to the elements of the displayed path.

In some cases a content source indication as displayed may be textually equivalent to the link or path the indication represents while in other cases a tag title or symbol may be displayed in lieu of a link or path corresponding to a content source. For example a content source accessible through the URL http www.domainname.com webpage may include metadata that defines the name of the content source as Home Page. In one embodiment the URL http www.domainname.com webpage may be displayed within display window as the content source indication while in another embodiment the page name Home Page may be displayed within display window as the content source indication.

Display characteristics of the content source indications shown within display interface may vary in some embodiments according to content interest data associated with the content sources. For example content interest weights or path weights may be determined according to any of the techniques discussed above. In various embodiments the weight of a content source may be reflected in its corresponding indication within display interface through variations in the font size display color display position or any other suitable display characteristic. For example content sources having larger weights may be displayed using a larger font size or in a brighter hue while content sources having smaller weights may be displayed using a smaller font size or in a darker hue. Combinations of display characteristics may also be used for example to display a single aspect of content interest data or multiple distinct aspects of such data. For example as described above a content source may have multiple different content interest weights. In one embodiment a different display characteristic may correspond respectively to a particular one of the different content interest weights.

In some embodiments display window may be configured to provide additional information about a particular indicated content source in response to a user s selection of the particular source. In the embodiment shown in display window may be configured to generate a detail window in response to a user s selecting a content source indication. For example display window may detect such selection by detecting a mouse over event in which the position of a mouse cursor is determined to be in the vicinity of a content source indication. Any other suitable indication of selection may also be detected.

Detail window may be configured to present any suitable additional information regarding a content source. In the illustrated embodiment detail window is configured to display path information corresponding to the indicated content source. The displayed information for a given path may include indications of those content sources included in the path arranged according to the path relationship. For example detail window indicates that according to collected content request traffic data e.g. as determined by IA system popular user navigation paths leading to indicated content source include a path that includes a content source A and a content source B as well as a path including content source C. Further detail window indicates that popular destination paths for users leaving indicated content source include a path including a content source D as well as a path including a content source E. Each of the indicated content sources A E shown within the indicated paths may in one embodiment correspond to a navigable URL or other selectable indication through which a user may access the corresponding content source. In some embodiments it is contemplated that detail window may be configured to display content source details other than or in addition to path details. For example detail window may display content interest statistics or other data such as the weight s associated with a particular content source at various points in time.

One embodiment of a method of displaying content interest data associated with individual online content sources is illustrated in . In the illustrated embodiment operation begins in block where a plurality of content sources is determined. In one embodiment determining the plurality of content sources may be dependent upon a respective indication of content interest associated with each of the content sources where the respective indication for a given content source is dependent upon a time rate of change of content request traffic directed to that content source. For example the indication may correspond to a content interest weight as described in detail above.

Subsequently a display indication for each of the content sources is displayed where at least a given one of the display indications is displayed differently from other display indications dependent upon the indication of content interest associated with the given display indication relative to other display indications block . For example the display indication may correspond to a hyperlink tag or other textual or symbolic display. As noted above in various embodiments the display indication may vary in some display characteristic such as font size color position etc. according to an associated content interest indication.

One of the content sources may then be selected block . For example a user may select a content source by clicking or simply rolling over the display indication of the content source using a mouse icon. In other embodiments a content source may be selected according to any suitable technique or gesture. One or more navigation paths corresponding to the selected content source may then be displayed block . For example a box or window such as detail window may be displayed for the selected content source where the details include navigation paths leading to and or from the selected content source as described above with respect to .

One embodiment of a method of displaying content interest data associated with navigation paths among online content sources is illustrated in . In the illustrated embodiment operation begins in block where a plurality of navigation paths among a plurality of online content sources is determined. For example in one embodiment IA system may be configured to determine navigation paths and or aggregate paths including navigation paths from content request traffic reports as described above with respect to .

Subsequently the navigation paths may be displayed where at least one given one of the navigation paths is displayed differently from other navigation paths dependent upon relative user activity along the various navigation paths block . For example display characteristics such as font size color position etc. associated with the given navigation path may vary dependent upon an indication of relative user activity associated with the given path such as a path weight.

It is noted that in some embodiments the display of content interest data according to the methods of may occur under the direct or indirect control of IA system . For example IA system may be configured to collect generate and maintain the content interest data that forms the basis for display. In one embodiment IA system may respond to queries or requests for content interest data generated for example by browser badge code or plugin . In responding with the requested data IA system may directly or indirectly cause the data to be displayed via an appropriate interface.

Content interest data such as weight and path information may evolve over time as content request traffic patterns change. Correspondingly in some embodiments a display of content interest data such as that shown in may be configured to periodically refresh. For example the functionality associated with display window may be configured to request content interest data from IA system at regular intervals and to responsively update the displayed indications such as by adjusting display characteristics or by removing some indications and adding others. In some embodiments the contents of display window may be refreshed at frequencies that approximate the real time behavior of the underlying content sources and navigation paths such as once every ten seconds for example.

It is noted that while display indications associated with content sources or paths may be visual or graphic indications they need not be. In some embodiments browser badge code or plugin may be configured to support display indications of content interest data other than visual indications. For example in some embodiments a user may configure one of these modules to generate an audible alert e.g. a beep when a particular content interest data event occurs such as when a weight of a content source or path exceeds a given value. In other embodiments a display indication may include an alert message conveyed through email telephone pager or any other suitable notification medium.

In some embodiments network may include many content sources e.g. tens hundreds thousands or more and correspondingly many distinct paths among content sources. Conceivably many different aggregate paths within network may have large aggregate path weights and consequently could be ranked as optimal or high ranking aggregate paths relative to network as a whole. However in large scale instances of network users may not be universally interested in every optimal aggregate path. Rather users may be interested in aggregate paths that correspond to their particular interests. That is a user may be more likely to be interested in optimal or near optimal aggregate paths that traverse some portion of network that includes content sources having some common aspect known to be or likely to be interesting to the user. Such portions of network may be referred to as interest regions or interest spaces.

Interest spaces within network may be defined according to any of a number of criteria. In one embodiment membership of content sources within a given interest space may be defined according to the navigation path weights between various content sources as reflected in network . Consider for example the embodiment of network shown in . In the illustrated embodiment content sources are shown as interconnected via a number of navigation paths and aggregate paths with the navigation path weights explicitly shown adjacent to their corresponding paths. As shown in a substantial fraction of navigation paths have minimal path weights e.g. 0 1 or 2 where 0 signifies the minimum possible weight in this example . Additionally the remaining higher weighted paths appear to be clustered around several particular groups of content sources .

This example suggests one possible definition that may be employed to organize a network into one or more interest spaces. Specifically according to one embodiment a given interest group within a network may be generated such that each content source that is a member of the given interest group is connected to at least one other content source within the given interest group either as an origin or destination by a navigation path having a corresponding path weight that satisfies a selection criterion. For example the selection criterion may be implemented as a threshold value such that a path weight may be required to be greater than or less than the threshold value to satisfy the selection criterion. However in other embodiments more complex selection criteria may also be used. For example a threshold value may be adjusted as an interest group increases in population which may cause the interest group to be more or less selective with respect to including additional content sources as members.

Suppose a selection criterion for interest space membership includes a path weight threshold of 2 such that navigation path weights must be strictly greater than 2 to satisfy the selection criterion. Applying this criterion to the embodiment of may result in the formation of two distinct interest spaces also shown in . Interest space includes content sources and while interest space includes content sources l and k. It is noted that content sources and having no navigation paths that satisfy the selection criterion do not belong to either of interest spaces . Also interest spaces are disjoint in that there exists no navigation path connecting the two spaces that satisfies the selection criterion. By contrast if the weight of either of paths EI or GJ had been greater than 2 a single interest space including the content sources of both interest spaces might have been generated. It is noted that while in this example interest spaces form closed regions including multiple aggregate paths among content sources within each interest space in some instances an interest space may not correspond to a closed region within network . For example a single aggregate path between two content sources may constitute an interest space regardless of whether the aggregate path is optimal.

One embodiment of a method of generating interest spaces within a network is shown in . In some embodiments such a method may be implemented by IA system and performed on a representation of a network derived from reported content request traffic as described above. In the illustrated embodiment operation begins in block where a given content source within a network is selected. For example content source of may be selected. Navigation paths to and from the given content source are then examined to determine whether any of the paths satisfy the interest space selection criterion block . If none of the navigation paths leading to or from the given content source satisfy the selection criterion then if any unselected content sources remain to be processed block operation may proceed from block where another given content source is selected. Otherwise operation may be complete block . For example for a selection criterion specifying a threshold navigation path weight of 2 as in the above discussion none of the paths from content source satisfy the threshold. Correspondingly content source or another content source may be selected. Selection of the next content source to process may occur systematically e.g. by considering the paths of previously processed sources.

If any of the navigation paths to or from the given content source satisfy the interest space selection criterion the given content source and those content sources along navigation paths to or from the given content source that do satisfy the criterion are identified as members of a new interest space and stored for further consideration block . Thus for example it may be determined that content source has destination navigation paths leading to content sources and and is a destination for a navigation path originating from content source each of which satisfies the threshold value of 2. Correspondingly each of content sources and may be identified as members of interest space . If a content source has previously been identified as a member of the interest space e.g. via a different path it may be disregarded from further processing.

It is then determined whether navigation paths have been evaluated for each content source that is a member of interest space block . If there exists one or more member content sources having unevaluated navigation paths one of these content sources may be selected block and its paths may be evaluated with respect to the interest space selection criterion block as described above with respect to block . If the selected content source has one or more navigation paths that do satisfy the selection criterion processing may proceed from block . Otherwise processing may proceed from block . Referring to the above example after content source is considered content source may be selected. Content source has a navigation path to content source that does satisfy the selection criterion but since content source was previously added to interest space it may be disregarded. Subsequently content source may be evaluated. As the navigation path to content source from content source satisfies the selection criterion content source may be added to interest space

If navigation paths have been evaluated for all current members of interest space the membership of interest space may be complete block . Operation may then proceed to block from which the remainder of network may be processed to generate other interest spaces if possible. For example following processing of content sources and content sources and may be evaluated. As these sources only have navigation paths to other content sources that are already members of interest space the definition of interest space may be complete. Operation may continue to generate the membership of interest space in a similar fashion. It is noted that while a particular approach is shown in any other suitable technique may also be employed to generate interest spaces within a network .

Once interest spaces have been generated within a network in some embodiments they may form the basis for the optimal aggregate path analysis techniques described above. For example rather than analyze all aggregate paths within an entire network in some embodiments plugin badge code or another code module or element may be configured to constrain aggregate path analysis to a particular interest space that has some association with a user. Such an association may include for example including a content source with which the user of browser window is currently interacting. In such embodiments this particular interest space may function in the place of network for the purpose of applying the previously discussed techniques of optimal aggregate path analysis. For example an interest space may form the basis for generating a trellis and performing a path optimization algorithm to identify optimal aggregate paths such as shown in .

It is also contemplated that in some embodiments a representation of an interest space may be presented directly to a user. For example plugin may be configured to generate a static or dynamic representation of an interest space related to a content source with which a user is currently interacting or to a recommended content source or path. Such a representation may be graphically displayed within toolbar or elsewhere within browser window or another window and may include various types of information about the included content sources such as URLs page titles abstracts images or other information. In some embodiments a representation of interest space may be navigable such that a user may be able to navigate to and or receive more detailed information about a particular content source by selecting it within the graphical interest space representation e.g. by clicking or rolling over an indication of the particular content source with a mouse icon .

It is noted that navigation path weight need not be the sole criterion for identifying interest spaces within a network . In some embodiments interest spaces may be further organized according to other aspects of content or navigation. For example interest spaces may be organized according to degree of similarity in the content or metadata of content sources or common factors relating the users navigating among content sources e.g. portions of IP addresses . Additionally in some embodiments statistically improbable phrases as mentioned above Bayesian filters or other suitable techniques for detecting relatedness of content may be employed in identifying interest spaces .

As described above an interest space may represent a set of content sources that are related or affiliated by virtue of user navigation patterns among the content sources . The relationship among content sources within an interest space may be any type of relationship sufficient to generate navigation traffic among the content sources that satisfies the conditions for identifying an interest space as described above. For example content sources may be topically related in a complementary fashion. However it is noted that identifying and or classifying the content of content sources may not be necessary for interest space identification. That is it may not be necessary to parse the content of content sources to check for commonalties. Instead user navigation patterns among content sources may evidence relatedness among content sources according to whatever criteria matter to the users generating the content request traffic.

Users who interact in various ways with content sources within an interest space may be related to one another by virtue of the relationships among the content sources from which the interest space arises. For example if two users access different content sources within an interest space there may exist a better than random chance that each of the users will have some interest in the content source that the other is accessing and correspondingly that both users may share some sort of mutual interest. Such users may effectively form a community whose members are interrelated by virtue of the interest space and identifying communities of users who are interacting with an interest space may provide additional useful information over and above identification of interest spaces themselves. For example such users may be interested in leaning about each other and possibly communicating with one another.

In some embodiments badge code or plugin may be configured to display a representation of a particular interest space to a given user who is interacting with a content source within particular interest space and may be further configured to display indications of other users who are interacting with content sources within particular interest space . One embodiment of such a representation is shown in as display . In the following discussion where a particular feature is described as being attributed to display or as an action display may be configured to perform it is understood that the underlying program instructions and data that implement various embodiments of display may be configured to implement the feature. Generally speaking display may be configured to display respective indications of at least a subset of content sources within an interest space for example using Flash Shockwave Javascript or any other suitable dynamic display technology. Such indications may include text icons or any other type or combination of types of indications suitable for display. In some embodiments a common indication may be used for all content sources displayed within the representation while in other embodiments different indications may be used to distinguish different types of content sources e.g. web pages audio content video content etc. . Display may also be configured to display indications of other users who are interacting with various ones of the indicated content sources for example by displaying names and or icons corresponding to such users. In some embodiments display may additionally be configured to display the links e.g. the navigation paths that relate various content sources to one another within an interest space . For example display may indicate such links by displaying a line corresponding to the link where some display property of the line e.g. color thickness line style etc. may vary according to the strength or weight of the corresponding link.

As shown in display includes content source indications corresponding respectively to five different content sources within an interest space . Indications correspond to three distinct web pages whose page titles are displayed along with an icon as part of the indication. Similarly indications and correspond respectively to and include the filenames of an MP3 audio file and an MPEG video file. In some embodiments URLs of the indicated content sources may also be included within indications . Correspondingly in some embodiments indications may be navigable links or implemented as another form of active display content such that in response to a user selecting a particular indication e.g. by clicking on it or hovering over it the user may navigate to the corresponding content source e.g. in a separate browser window or application window . Additionally display includes user indications of various users who are interacting with various ones of the indicated content sources . For example user indications may correspond to icons screen names or other types of display information corresponding to users who have previously requested access to various ones of the indicated content sources . It is contemplated that in various embodiments different numbers of users and different numbers and types of content sources may be indicated within display . It is further contemplated that in some embodiments only a portion of an interest space may be displayed at a given time for example in the case of large and complex interest spaces that include many different content sources .

In the illustrated embodiment a given user indication may be visually and dynamically associated with the particular content source a corresponding user is currently or has recently interacted with. That is users may be indicated within display as being in particular locations within interest space according to their navigation behavior where this indication may be implemented by displaying a user indication in close visual proximity with a particular content source indication e.g. closer to the particular content source indication than to any other content source indication . As described below in some embodiments as users navigate among various content sources within an interest space display may be updated to reflect such navigation in the displayed indications . It is contemplated that in other embodiments user indications need not be specifically associated with particular content source indications within display . Instead user indications may simply be grouped or listed at an interest space level of granularity. For example user indications may be collectively listed adjacent to content source indications or elsewhere within display .

One embodiment of a method of displaying interest space community information is shown in . Referring collectively to operation begins in block where a request to access a given online content source is detected the request being generated on behalf of a given user and the given online content source being one of several online content sources included in an interest space . For example badge code or plugin may be configured to detect an access request entered by a user such as an HTTP GET request directed to a particular content source as a result of a URL having been entered or otherwise selected on behalf of the user. In some embodiments the identification of interest spaces may be performed separately as described above for example by IA system . In one embodiment badge code or plugin may be configured to query IA system or another system configured to store information about interest space membership to identify the interest space s to which the given online content source belongs if any. It is noted that while in some embodiments badge code or plugin may be configured to detect requests to access a given online content source when they are generated by a user e.g. to perform client side request detection in other embodiments such requests may be detected indirectly. For example badge code or plugin may be configured to receive an access request from IA system such as in response to a query for access request data or under a publish subscribe or other push type notification model.

In response to detecting the access request a representation of the interest space to which the given online content source belongs may be displayed where the representation includes respective indications of at least a subset of the content sources within the interest space block . For example badge code or plugin may be configured to retrieve interest space membership information from IA system or another suitable system. Such information may include for example URLs corresponding to interest space members information about links and link weights among content sources and or other relevant interest space information. Badge code or plugin may then be configured to display such information within display which may be included within badge toolbar elsewhere within browser window or within a separate window or display provided by a graphical user interface. It is noted that in some embodiments the representation need not include every member of the interest space . For example if the given online content source belongs to a large interest space only a portion of the interest space may be displayed at one time such as a portion including those other content sources that are topologically proximate to the given content source . In such embodiments display may support a pan scroll or other interface technique for causing other portions of the interest space to be displayed.

Additionally for a particular online content source within the subset included within the representation respective indications may be displayed of users on whose behalf respective previously generated requests to access the particular online content source have been detected block . For example these indications may be displayed as user indications within display . In some embodiments badge code or plugin may be configured to track user request information in a distributed fashion at the content source level or at the level of individual users or web browsers. For example once badge code or plugin is aware of the other content sources within an interest space the code may be configured to communicate with other instances of badge code or plugin that may be hosted by a host or requestor in order to obtain information about other users who are currently navigating or have recently navigated within interest space . In other embodiments user request information specific to content sources within the interest space may be obtained from a centralized system such as IA system . In some embodiments individual users may initially only be identified by a unique identifier such as an identifier associated with browser unless such users have elected to supply additional identifying information e.g. a screen name in association with the unique identifier.

In addition to displaying indications of content sources and users within an interest space in some embodiments display may be configured to display to a given user a communication interface that may be configured to allow the given user to communicate with other users who are indicated within a representation of interest space . One such embodiment of display is illustrated in . In the illustrated embodiment in addition to the features described above display includes a chat display field and a chat entry field . Chat display field may be configured to display a number of lines of text previously exchanged by users indicated within display who are participating in a conversation as well as an identifier of the user who generated each displayed entry which may correspond to the user indication displayed for that user within display . In some embodiments each chat entry displayed within field may include an indication e.g. a URL of the content source to which the corresponding user had most recently navigated when he or she generated the corresponding chat entry. Chat entry field may be configured to allow the given user to enter text that is to be displayed to other users participating in the chat. In some embodiments display may be configured to allow the given user to edit or customize the indication that will appear within chat display field corresponding to the given user s chat entries.

One embodiment of a method of operation of a version of display that includes communication capabilities is shown in . Referring collectively to operation begins in block where a given user s request to access a given online content source included in an interest space is detected. In response to the request display may be configured to display a representation of the interest space including indications of content sources and other users in a manner similar to that described above with respect to block . The given user may also be queried to determine whether the given user wishes to participate in an ongoing conversation with other users within the interest space block . For example display may be configured to display a dialog box or other prompt inviting the given user to respond by clicking a button or performing another suitable action. If the given user declines to participate the given user may be indicated as an anonymous user within the displayed representation of the interest space block . In some embodiments if the given user declines to participate in conversation with other users display may conceal chat display field and chat entry field from the given user while in other embodiments the given user may be allowed to anonymously observe the conversation via chat display field .

If the given user elects to participate chat display field and chat entry field may be displayed to the given user block and updated in response to input from the given user or from other users participating in the conversation block . In some embodiments in response to the given user electing to participated in the conversation display may be configured to prompt the given user to choose an identifier to be displayed along with his or her chat entries. If the given user declines to specify an identifier display may assign a random identifier. If the user does provide an identifier display may check the identifier for uniqueness among other identifiers indicated within display and in some embodiments may reject the identifier if it is not unique. In some embodiments the resulting random or user specified identifier may also be used as the indication for the given user in the representation of interest space shown within display .

Conversations conducted among participating members of the interest space community may be carried out through any suitable messaging technology. For example display may be configured to directly communicate with other instances of display on a peer to peer basis or may indirectly communicate via a messaging server that may be implemented within or distinct from IA system . More generally the types of communication that may be facilitated by display among interest space community members need not be limited to text based communication. In some embodiments a communications interface presented to users via display may support the exchange of audio and or video communication among such users and or may support the exchange of files e.g. data or media files links or any other suitable type of data among such users. Additionally in some embodiments display may offer a variety of customization options that may be selectable by the given user. For example display may allow the user to configure various aspects of the appearance of content source indications user indications chat display field and or chat entry field such as font size color the amount of chat history accessible via display field etc. In some embodiments display may provide functional options that may be configured to e.g. allow the given user to save a transcript of a conversation to a file to commence a private chat session with another user that is separate from and not visible to other users in the interest space community.

Over time users may navigate among various ones of the content sources within a given interest space . Such navigation may be manifested as additional content source access requests generated on behalf of the users which may be detected indirectly or directly by display . For example such content source access requests may be reported to IA system as described above. Correspondingly display may be configured to query IA system for example at periodic intervals to obtain new access request information corresponding to indicated users or content sources . For example display may obtain updated status information indicative of the current state or changes in state of a given interest space and or updated status information indicative of the current state or changes in state of users associated with various content sources . Display may then update or refresh the displayed user and content source indications to reflect the updated status information. Alternatively display may receive new access request information from IA system according to a push content access model such as a publish subscribe model in which display may register to receive updates with respect to a particular set of users or content sources . In a distributed embodiment different instances of display may be configured to communicate navigation related state changes with one another. For example an instance of display may be configured to detect content source access requests at the content source level e.g. if configured on the content source host side or at the user level e.g. if configured on the client or requestor side and to communicate such requests to other instances of display using an appropriate distributed protocol.

As display receives new navigation information generated on behalf of indicated users whether from a centralized reporting system such as IA system or from other display instances the interest space representation displayed to a given user may be updated accordingly. For example if a particular user navigates from a first content source to a second content source within a particular interest space then in response to detecting this navigation one embodiment of display may be configured to display an updated representation of the particular interest space that shows the user indication corresponding to the particular user as being associated with the content source indication corresponding to the second content source .

Similarly if a user who is indicated within display navigates to a content source that is not included within the particular interest space display may be configured to remove the user s corresponding user indication from the displayed representation thus effectively indicating that the user has left the interest space community. In some embodiments a user activity timeout may also be associated with users who are indicated within display such that if a given user does not contribute to a conversation via chat entry field or otherwise request access to a content source within the particular interest space for at least a certain period of time the given user may be deemed to have left the interest space community due to inactivity and may be treated in the same manner as a user who navigates away from the particular interest space . In some embodiments if a given user who was participating in a conversation via display navigates away from the displayed interest space or times out due to inactivity the instance of display corresponding to the given user may be configured to terminate the given user s participation in the conversation for example by closing chat display field and chat entry field or by display closing entirely. In certain embodiments that support user activity timeout the timeout period may be user programmable or a user may be allowed to disable the timeout feature. As an example illustrates an embodiment of display in which certain users have entered left or navigated to different content sources within interest space relative to the user state illustrated in .

Thus in some embodiments display may be configured to display the state of members of an interest space community with respect to the content sources within an interest space not only at a particular point in time but may also display the dynamic state of interest space community membership as existing users navigate within and or leave the community and as new users arrive. Display may further be configured to facilitate communications among members of the interest space community for example via text based chat as described above. It is noted that an interest space may include content sources that exist within any number of different domains. Correspondingly the community of users that may be indicated within a displayed representation of an interest space as well as their shared communications may likewise cross any number of domains. That is both the interest space and the user community may exist as virtual entities that arise from user interactions with content sources .

As described above an interest space may be dynamic in that content sources may be added to or removed from an interest space as content access request traffic patterns change. Correspondingly in some embodiments display may be configured to add or remove content source indications from the displayed representation of an interest space . Generally display may be configured to receive state changes regarding interest space membership in any suitable manner such as any of the techniques described above through which display may receive updated state information pertaining to user navigation. For example display may receive interest space state information from IA system .

In some embodiments as content sources enter or leave an interest space display may be configured to correspondingly update user indications that are associated with the content sources in transition. For example a given content source may be deleted from a particular interest space as a result of the strength of the navigation traffic based link s between the given content source and other content source s within particular interest space falling below a threshold value. In response to detecting that the given content source is no longer a member of the particular interest space display may be configured to remove or cease to display the user indications of any users indicated as associated with the given content source e.g. those users who were interacting with or last requested access to the given content source from the displayed representation of the particular interest space . The removed users may also be prevented from participating in any ongoing conversations being displayed via chat display field although in some embodiments the comments made by users prior to their removal may continue to be displayed. In some embodiments display may be configured to display a message within chat display field to the effect that the removed users are no longer participating in the conversation. As an example illustrates an embodiment of display in which the content sources originally indicated in by indications have been removed from the interest space and several new content sources indicated by content source indications have been added to the interest space . It is noted that in some embodiments before a user indication or content source indication ultimately ceases to be displayed in response to user navigation activity user inactivity or interest space membership changes display may be configured to modify the display of the user or content source indication in a manner that visually distinguishes the modified indication from indications corresponding to users or content sources to which the activity inactivity or other state changes do not apply. For example display may be configured to display such indications in a low contrast or grayed out fashion relative to other indications and may do so for a possibly configurable period of time before ultimately ceasing to display the indications. In some embodiments if a corresponding user or content source rejoins the interest space or reestablishes activity prior to the period of time elapsing display may be configured to restore the modified indication to normal appearance.

A special case may exist where a particular interest space divides into two or more disconnected interest spaces for example owing to the strength of internal links within the particular interest space weakening to a point that is below a threshold value. In some embodiments in response to the division of the particular interest space a display associated with a given user may be configured to update the displayed representation to reflect the disconnected interest space of which the given user is a community member. That is following the division of the particular interest space the given user may remain a member of a smaller interest space community that may be determined by the content source with which the given user was last associated. In such an embodiment if there was an ongoing conversation occurring with respect to the particular interest space prior to its division the given user may remain a participant in a conversation with those community members corresponding to his or her disconnected interest space . However the future contributions of those users who are no longer community members of the same interest space as the given user may no longer be visible to the given user. That is the division of the particular interest space may result in the division of its corresponding interest space community and its communication.

One embodiment illustrating variations of display following interest space division is shown in . Prior to division display may display a consistent view of an interest space to each user who is a member of the corresponding community as described above with respect to . Subsequent the interest space represented in being divided into two resultant interest spaces display may update the displayed representation accordingly dependent on which resultant interest space a given user remains associated with following the division. For example users who are members of the interest space community corresponding to the first resultant interest space may be presented with display as shown in while users corresponding to the second resultant interest space may be presented with display as shown in . In some embodiments both displays may reflect a portion of the common conversation that occurred prior to the division. However subsequent conversation occurring with respect to one resultant interest space may not appear to members of the other resultant interest space . In some embodiments users participating in communication via display may be notified of an interest space division or other changes in user or interest space status. For example users may be notified that other users who are no longer affiliated with the resultant interest space have left the conversation as shown in . However notification of changes in interest space or user presence status is not required. In some embodiments if such notifications are available they may be configurable by a user such that only certain types of notifications may be displayed.

Just as a given interest space may divide into two or more interest spaces it is also possible for multiple interest spaces to merge into a single interest space as a result of content request traffic patterns. In one embodiment display may be configured to reflect the representation of a merged interest space accordingly for example by adding content source indications and user indications to the existing representation in a manner similar to that in which a new user or content source may be added. In one embodiment display may be configured to merge any ongoing conversations occurring among the community members of the merged interest spaces . For example display may be configured to merge previous chat entries for each of the merged interest spaces into chat display field e.g. according to the timestamp of the previous entries. Alternatively display may not merge chat entries entered prior to the merger but may allow any member of the post merger interest community to participate in conversation subsequent to the merger. In one embodiment users who were anonymously browsing an interest space prior to its merger with another interest space may remain anonymous with respect to the merged interest space .

As described above the grouping of content sources into interest spaces may generally be dependent upon the level of content request traffic along the navigation paths among the content sources . In some embodiments the communication that occurs among members of an interest space community for example via display as described above may be imputed to the content sources with which the members are associated. For example two users may respectively request access to two different content sources within an interest space . The two users may then engage in communication via respective instances of display . In one embodiment the communication between the users may be counted e.g. by IA system as navigation traffic between content sources and may correspondingly strengthen the connection between content sources within interest space . In such embodiments communication among interest space community members may generally operate to strengthen associations within the corresponding interest space even though such communication may occur at a different level of abstraction than the navigation traffic that occurs between content sources themselves. For example such communication traffic may be implemented using a different type of technique or protocol than that employed to generate content source access request traffic. In other embodiments path weights between content source members of an interest space may be independent of any communication that may occur among interest space community members.

As described in detail above techniques such as optimal aggregate path determination and interest space analysis may be employed to generate suggestions or recommendations to users regarding potentially interesting content sources as a function of the behavior of a community of users relative to a network of content sources . That is the activity of users in general when processed according to the techniques discussed above may facilitate the self organization of a complex interest topology into structures e.g. paths and or interest spaces . These structures may in turn allow users to be informed of those portions of the topology in which they may be interested and conversely may operate to deemphasize other portions of less potential interest.

In some embodiments optimal aggregate paths and or interest spaces may be identified relative to a user s current state with respect to a particular content source . For example a content source that is the current focus of user interaction e.g. via a browser window or another application may serve as the starting point for path or interest space analysis. However in other embodiments a user may be actively searching for content sources based on some criteria. For example a user may perform a keyword search via a search engine to identify content sources that satisfy a query including one or more keywords according to various default or user specified rules for combining the keywords. A conventional search engine may construct indexes of content sources e.g. by examining the content of each content source and processing it to identify keyword terms that may then be associated with the content source . Keywords determined in this fashion may then be compared against those specified by a user s query according to any selection rules present in the query e.g. match all keywords match any keyword etc. to select sources to present to the user.

Generally speaking a search query may represent some minimum criterion a content source must satisfy to appear in the results of a search. However not all sources that satisfy the search query may be equally interesting to a user. Correspondingly search results may be ranked in various ways. In one embodiment a search engine e.g. a program application or other type of executable module realized in software and or hardware and configured to perform search functions may be configured to order a list of content sources representing search results of a search query according to the interest weights associated with the content sources which may be determined according to the methods and systems described above in conjunction with the descriptions of .

In another embodiment a conventional search engine may be configured to identify optimal aggregate paths associated with content sources that appear in a set of search results for example according to the methods and techniques described above with respect to . The search engine may then be configured to rank the search results according to the aggregate path weight associated with the optimal aggregate path determined for the content sources in the search result set. It is noted that in these embodiments the techniques of ranking according to interest weights of content sources or weights of paths related to content sources may be applied to any type of search engine regardless of how the search engine structures or indexes content sources and regardless of the format of the query used to perform a search. For example these techniques may be applied to simple keyword searches or searches conducted according to a formal query language such as a version of Structured Query Language SQL XML Query language XQuery or another suitable query language in addition to keyword searches that do not employ any formal or structured query language.

While the techniques disclosed herein may be employed in conjunction with conventional search engines that index content sources by exhaustively crawling or spidering such content sources as stated previously index based approaches to organizing content may suffer from various limitations. For example a conventional indexing search engine may take days or weeks to refresh its indexes. Consequently such a search engine may be relatively insensitive to content sources that change more frequently than the frequency with which they are indexed. In some instances content sources may conceivably appear and disappear before ever having an opportunity to be indexed by the search engine.

Additionally the quality of conventional indexing may be dependent upon the algorithms used to extract the keyword information to be associated with a content source from the content source itself. But it may be challenging to determine a representative set of keywords directly from a content source . For example keywords may depend on contextual meaning not captured by a purely lexical analysis. Words that appear within a content source and thus function as candidates for keyword extraction may not be truly indicative of the information content of the source for example in cases where content source creators deliberately attempt to obscure the nature of the content source by embedded random or off topic words within the structure of e.g. a web page. Also certain kinds of content sources simply do not readily lend themselves to keyword extraction for indexing. For example a nontextual content source such as an image audio data executable code or other forms of encoded data might include little if any text that could function as a useful keyword for that content source .

As discussed above with respect to the techniques of content source interest weighting aggregate path interest weighting and interest space analysis considerable information about the interest or utility of various kinds of content may be derived from data indicative of how such content is actually used. For example content access request information may be indicative of user interest with respect to a particular content source while various types of navigation traffic or other relational data among content sources may be indicative of user interest with respect to various paths or interest spaces within a network of content sources . Correspondingly as an alternative to associating keywords or other search oriented data with content sources on the basis of conventional content indexing in some embodiments such associations may be generated on the basis of user related content source activity such as request traffic directed to a content source or navigation traffic along a path or within an interest space.

One embodiment of a method of performing a search of content sources using keywords that may be associated with content sources via indications of user activity e.g. request or navigation traffic is illustrated in . As shown in in one embodiment such a method may be implemented for example by a search engine configured as an executable module or process within IA system although it is contemplated that in other embodiments search engine may be implemented via a system distinct from IA system .

Operation of the method of begins in block where one or more keywords are specified for a search operation. In various embodiments a user may explicitly specify search keywords in a variety of ways. For example search engine may implement a web based interface accessible via browser window through which a search query including keywords and or other terms may be specified. In some embodiments toolbar may be configured to provide a field in which a user may specify a query without having to navigate away from a particular content source to a page presented by search engine . It is contemplated that search keywords may also be specified in other ways. For example as an alternative to a user explicitly entering keywords in some embodiments plugin or some other code module or entity may be configured to derive keywords from the user s context. For example plugin may be configured to examine content of a content source with which a user is currently interacting or had previously interacted e.g. within a usage session or over a particular period of time and may derive keywords for possible searches from the examined content. In deriving keywords for possible searches plugin may also be configured to take other user state information into account such as user preferences user transaction history e.g. purchase transactions user profile or self identification data or any other relevant user state information. For example if a user expresses interest in certain topics within a profile or in preference information those topics may influence suggested keyword selection.

Subsequent to keyword specification content sources that correspond to the search keywords are identified block . For example as shown in search engine may be configured to maintain trees tables or other data structures shown in as content source path data structures that reflect the association of keywords and content sources . As described in greater detail below in some embodiments keywords may be associated with aggregate paths in addition to or instead of content sources . Search engine may be configured to evaluate data structures to identify content sources that correspond to the specified search keywords. In some embodiments search engine may be configured to enforce various search rules specified along with the keywords. For example a search query may specify that a content source should be returned only if that source corresponds to all specified keywords the keywords as specified in a given order or within a certain degree of proximity to one another or other types of constraints.

One embodiment of data structures is shown in to include a number of entries each of which may include a content source path identifier an indication of a global weight and an arbitrary number of keyword entries each including a keyword and a weight. In some embodiments identifier may correspond to a URL of a content source or another suitable type of identifier such as a signature or hash. Global weight may correspond to the global weight determined for the content source as described above with respect to although it is contemplated that in some embodiments global weight may be stored in a data structure distinct from data structures e.g. a data structure internal to TA engine or a distinct data structure within IA system . In the illustrated embodiment an arbitrary number of keyword entries may be associated with a content source via their inclusion in a data structure entry . The functional relationship of keyword entries to content sources is described in greater detail below with respect to blocks of . Generally speaking weights associated with keyword entries may indicate the strength of association of a corresponding keyword with a content source or path. For example as described below by virtue of selecting a content source or path presented on the basis of a set of search keywords a user may establish or strengthen an association or relationship between the search keywords and the selected content source .

Once content sources corresponding to the specified keywords also referred to herein as a result set of content sources have been identified paths corresponding to the identified content sources may also be identified block . These paths may also be referred to as a result set of paths. For example as described above with respect to in one embodiment one or more optimal aggregate paths associated with each of the result set of content sources may be identified. It is noted that in some embodiments aggregate path analysis may be performed in response to identifying the members of the result set while in other embodiments aggregate path information may be generated and maintained for a network independent of search activity. For example search engine may be configured to consult a data structure maintained by another process or facility to obtain aggregate path information relevant to members of a particular result set. It is noted that in some embodiments only those aggregate paths originating from members of the result set may be considered while in other embodiments any optimal aggregate path intersecting a content source that is a member of the result set may be deemed a corresponding path for search purposes.

Members of the result set of paths corresponding to the result set of content sources may then be ranked block . In some embodiments the ranking of paths may be a function of the weights of keyword entries associated with content sources within the identified paths. Specifically in one embodiment the search rank weight of a given content source in the result set of content sources may be determined as a function e.g. a sum of the weights of each keyword entry that matches a corresponding keyword specified for the search operation. Then the search rank weight of a given path in the result set of paths may be determined as a function e.g. a sum of the search rank weight of each of the content sources within the path. For example a given content source may be associated with a number of keyword entries . In the example two of the keywords may match corresponding keywords of a given search operation and may have respective weights of 12 and 10. Then the search rank weight of the given content source may be given as 12 10 22. Further the given content source may be included within a path along with other content sources having respective search rank weights of 15 8 and 2. The the search rank weight of this particular member of the result set of paths may be given as 22 15 8 2 47. Once search rank weights for members of the result set of paths have been determined according to a suitable ranking model the result set of paths may be ranked e.g. ordered according to the search rank weights.

The resulting ranked paths may then be displayed block . For example search engine may be configured to display a ranked list of paths within a browser window via browser or within toolbar via plugin . In other embodiments the ranked paths may be presented to a user in any suitable fashion such as within an email an instant messenger IM communication or using other communication techniques.

One embodiment of a user interface through which aggregate paths derived from a keyword search may be displayed is shown in . In various embodiments search engine may cause search results display to be displayed via browser window toolbar or another suitable application. In the illustrated embodiment search results display is configured to display the top N paths for a particular keyword query. As shown paths and N include indications of 10 distinct content sources related according to different combinations of navigation paths. In some embodiments each content source indication shown in search results display may be configured as a hyperlink or other navigable link selectable by a user.

In the illustrated embodiment some displayed content sources may be members of the search result set selected according to the keyword query while displayed content sources may be selected according to their path relationships with members of the search result set. For example in one embodiment content sources and may satisfy a particular keyword query. At least some of the remaining content sources may not satisfy the particular keyword query but may instead be selected for display based on the strength of the path relationships they share with content sources and or .

A user may then select a particular content source from the search results e.g. from a ranked list of paths block . For example a user may click on a hyperlink corresponding to a content source as shown in search results display . If the user does select a particular content source the search keywords that were originally specified in block may be propagated to the particular content source . In one embodiment propagation of keywords to a content source may include adding keyword entries to an entry within data structure corresponding to the content source . Such adding of a keyword entry may be contingent upon the corresponding entry not already existing within entry .

The rationale of keyword propagation may be understood as follows. As described above with respect to block a set of content sources that correspond to the specified search keywords may be identified. This correspondence may be detected on the basis of an existing association of the search keywords and the content sources e.g. as reflected within entries . However in block paths are identified on the basis of the content sources identified in block and these paths may include content sources that do not have a current association with the search keywords. Rather the paths may be formed on the basis of some other relationship among content sources such as navigation traffic patterns. By virtue of selecting a content source that was presented on the basis of the search keywords a user may establish an association or relationship between the search keywords and the selected content source . Consequently the search keywords may be propagated to the selected content source .

Following keyword propagation to the selected content source which may involve no operation if the search keywords were already associated with the selected content source the weights included in the keyword entries that correspond to the search keywords are updated block . Generally speaking the weights included in keyword entries may be defined and manipulated in a manner similar to that of global and local content source weights described above in some cases the weights of keyword entries may be considered instances of local content source weights although they may be updated on the basis of search specific traffic rather than general content request traffic. For example when updated as a result of block the keyword weights they may be increased by some amount such as a fixed increment or a function of the number of weights updated. Also like the global and local content source weights described above keyword weights may decay over time according to any suitable decay model. Thus in some embodiments if ongoing user search activity does not reinforce the associations between keywords and content sources those associations may weaken over time and eventually dissipate. It is noted that a user s selection of content sources on the basis of search results may result in existing paths among content sources being modified or new paths being created. For example a user may navigate from a content source along one search result path to a content source along a different search result path thus creating or reinforcing a path between these sources. Through the operation of optimal aggregate path analysis described above this activity may ultimately influence the structure of network and may alter future search results correspondingly.

Following update of the keyword associated weights of the selected content source operation may proceed to block where another content source from the ranked search results may be selected. For example the user may continue to navigate the originally chosen path or may select a different path. In some embodiments user session tracking techniques e.g. browser cookies may be employed to facilitate detection of a user s selection of search result related content sources . From block the user may also fail to choose any source from the ranked search result paths either when the search result paths are originally presented e.g. at block or after having already selected some content sources . In this case operation may proceed to block where a new search may begin. Alternatively a user may navigate away from search functionality entirely and begin a different task. In some embodiments it is contemplated if none of the result set of content sources is selected following a search negative feedback may be applied to the weights of corresponding keyword entries . That is keyword weights may be positively reinforced e.g. adjusted upwards upon content source selection block thus strengthening the association between the adjusted keywords and the content source . Conversely if a user finds none of the content sources appealing the keyword associations may be weakened by e.g. decreasing keyword weights included in keyword entries .

It is noted that in general a set of content sources may have related content for example as evidenced by navigation traffic patterns e.g. paths among the sources but may not share keywords in common. Identified path relationships among the content sources may serve as a basis for associating keywords among the source. In particular it is noted this association may take place without requiring that content sources be indexed or that their content be accessed by search engine in any way. In fact a given content source may be associated with a keyword by virtue of its path based relationship with another content source even though the keyword may not actually appear anywhere within the given content source . Thus for example images and other nontextual content sources may be readily associated with tags without the need for deliberate classification of the nontextual content sources by a user or other agent. In general the technique of associating keywords with content sources on the basis of path relationships grounded in usage behavior may be referred to herein as an associative keyword model.

In some circumstances it may be the case that no content sources are associated with the keywords of a particular search operation. To facilitate the seeding of keywords among content sources in some embodiments other criteria may be employed for presenting content sources in response to a search. For example content sources that have particularly high global weights or aggregate paths having high path weights may be presented to a user if no keyword specific content sources can be identified. In some embodiments these types of content sources and or paths may also be presented alongside search results derived from keyword associations. Just as individual users may or may not reinforce existing keyword associations among results they may or may not generate new keyword associations among results. In the aggregate user behavior over time may result in pertinent keyword associations being generated and maintained while erroneous inaccurate or otherwise ill formed associations may be allowed to weaken and decay.

It is noted that while the associative keyword model just described may obviate the need for content indexing in some embodiments a limited degree of indexing may be performed to assist in the generation and maintenance of keyword associations with content sources . In particular rather than perform an exhaustive indexing of content sources through conventional crawling or spidering techniques in some embodiments content source interest weights or path weights may be used to select a particular subset of content sources on which to perform indexing. For example content sources or aggregate paths having particularly high weights according to request or navigation traffic may be selected as useful indexing candidates.

Several generalizations of the associative keyword model may be made. It is noted that in some embodiments keywords may be associated with paths themselves and not simply content sources. Thus data structures may be pertinent to both aggregate paths and content sources . For example upon being identified through the path analysis techniques described above aggregate paths may be tagged with a unique identifying value that may be stored as content source path identifier . Subsequently paths may be selected on the basis of their associated keywords matching a keyword search operation. Keywords may be associated with such paths and positively or negatively reinforced in a manner similar to that described above for content sources in the description of .

It is also noted that in some embodiments the keyword associations generated through operation of the associative keyword model may serve as the basis for generation of interest spaces . For example rather than identifying members of an interest space on the basis of aggregate path weights derived from navigation traffic as described above in one embodiment interest space members may be identified on the basis of commonality of keywords that have been associated with content sources via usage activity.

As described above in some embodiments search keywords may be associated with particular content sources by virtue of navigation path relationships that may exist among those content sources . In a similar vein search keywords may be associated among content sources on the basis of interest spaces in a variety of different ways. For example as mentioned previously membership of a content source in an interest space implies some degree of relatedness between the content source and an interest space even if the relationship is not semantically explicit or positive but rather reflected in patterns of navigation traffic among the members of the interest space . Based on the presumed relationship between a content source and an interest space that includes it if a given content source is a member of a particular interest space then in some embodiments keywords that are applicable to the given content source for any reason may also be applicable to the particular interest space . That is keywords associated with individual content source members of an interest space may be associated with the interest space as a whole and may be used to distinguish that interest space from others associated with different keywords.

Further in some embodiments a content source that is a member of an interest space may become associated with keywords that are associated with the interest space as a whole thus effectively inheriting keyword associations from other content sources by virtue of the interest space relationship. For example two content sources may be members of a particular interest space . Content source may have been previously associated or tagged with keywords A and B e.g. as a result of the associative keyword model described above a user s explicitly tagging content source with the keywords or through some other action. Content source may never have previously been associated with keywords A and B through any means. However content sources are related in at least some fashion by virtue of common membership in interest space . Correspondingly keywords A and B may be useful in categorizing or describing some aspect of the content of content source . Even though keywords A and B were not previously associated with content source they may be indirectly associated with content source for various purposes dependent upon the interest space relationship between the two content sources.

In some circumstances access requests directed to content sources may originate from search engines as a result of a keyword query specified by a user. For example as described above a user may specify a set of keywords with which to search for content in response to which a search engine may provide a listing of content sources typically along with navigable links to the content sources such as URLs that satisfy the query. Selection of a listed content source such as by clicking on a link may result in the user s navigating to the selected content source via a content source access request. Frequently access requests that originate from search engines may include as part of the referral information associated with the request some or all of the keyword data used for the query. For example a search of a given search engine using the keywords bestselling and authors may produce a set of results displayed on a page having the following URL 

In this example the search keywords are included in the result page URL following the q term although in other search engine embodiments any valid syntax may be employed to include search keywords in the result page URL.

The search results presented by a search engine for a particular keyword query may include a number of navigable links e.g. URLs to various content sources identified by the search engine as results satisfying the keyword query. A user may navigate to a particular one of the resultant content sources for example by selecting a particular URL from the search results page. In so doing a content source access request may be generated that is directed to the selected content source . As described above with respect to the access request may include referral information identifying the content source from which the access request originated. In this case the referral information may include the URL of the search engine result page including the search keywords as noted above.

As described in detail above in some embodiments content source access requests may be reported to a system such as IA system either by the host that hosts a content source to which a request is directed or by the requestor that generates the request. In one particular embodiment the access requests may be processed to extract or harvest search keyword information that may be included in the requests such as in referral URL information as described above. One embodiment of a method of extracting search keywords from access requests is shown in . In the illustrated embodiment operation begins in block where a request to access a given online content source is detected where the request includes referral information that specifies one or more search keywords associated with the request and where the given content source is a member of an interest space that includes a number of content sources . For example such a request may be detected by IA system after it is reported by a host as described above.

Search keywords may then be extracted from the request block . In various embodiments the keyword extraction process may involve a number of different actions. For example the request may first be analyzed to verify that it includes referral information from a search engine. Such an analysis may include examining the domain name included in the referral URL information in order to determine whether the domain name corresponds to any of a number of well known search engines. A referral URL may then be parsed to identify the keywords that may be included within it. For example once a referral URL has been identified as corresponding to a particular search engine rules of syntax specific to the particular search engine may be applied in order to identify the specific portions of the URL that correspond to search keywords. In embodiments where further processing may be performed to extract search keywords such as canonical form processing as described below the tokens resulting from URL parsing may be referred to as keyword candidates.

While first identifying the search engine that corresponds to a referral URL may simplify keyword parsing it is contemplated that in some embodiments a generalized parser may be employed to attempt to extract keywords from referral URLs based on the syntactic structure of the URL without dependence on its domain. In some embodiments the parsing process may include identifying qualifiers or parameters that may have been supplied in addition to keywords as part of the original search operation. For example such qualifiers may include Boolean parameters that specify specific relationship among the search terms such as AND OR and NOT parameters. Qualifiers may also include indications such as quotation marks or other punctuation or ASCII representations of such punctuation that indicate a particular grouping of keywords. For example quotation marks may have been used in the original search expression to specify that a collection of keywords is to be regarded as a phrase rather than a discrete set of keywords. In various embodiments search qualifiers or parameters may either be preserved along with keyword data or discarded during the parsing process.

In some embodiments keyword extraction may be complete once keywords have been identified through parsing of the detected request. In other embodiments additional processing may occur during keyword extraction in order to refine keyword data. For example different candidates or tokens may be morphologically related to a common stem or root form such as sell sells selling and sold. Processing each of these as a distinct keyword unrelated to the others may obscure their common semantic relationship. Thus in some embodiments a keyword candidate that is extracted from a content source access request may be processed to convert the candidate to a canonical or universal form such as a stem which may be carried forward for further processing as a keyword. For example in one embodiment each of the above keyword candidates may be converted to the canonical keyword sell and though literally distinct may be treated as four instances of this canonical form. It is noted that in some embodiments that employ such morphological processing different keyword candidates that map to the same canonical or stem form may be treated as functionally equivalent for keyword matching e.g. search purposes. For example a search for any of sell sells selling or sold among extracted keywords may match the stored canonical keyword sell. In addition to morphological processing certain keyword candidates included in an access request may be eliminated owing to their linguistic frequency and or lack of substantive meaning. For example common parts of speech such as a the and is and similar terms may contribute little to the identification of a content source and may be eliminated from the set of extracted keywords without significant information loss. Such terms which may be referred to as stop words may be specified in lists or tables and updated as necessary.

An association may then be created between the one or more extracted search keywords and the interest space s of which the given content source is a member block . For example each member of the resulting set of extracted search keywords may be stored in association with the corresponding interest space s . In various embodiments the association between extracted keywords and an interest space may be created in a direct or indirect fashion. For example in one embodiment IA system may be configured to store a data structure such as a table that identifies for each interest space the specific content sources that are its members. In one such embodiment extracted search keywords may be stored in direct association with interest spaces within such a data structure.

However as noted previously interest space membership may change over time as patterns of user navigation activity among content sources change. Correspondingly it is possible that a given interest space may become associated with a particular search keyword by virtue of an access request to a content source that subsequently ceases to be a member of the given interest space . In some embodiments it may be desirable for the keywords associated with interest spaces to dynamically reflect changes in interest space membership over time such that keywords may become associated or disassociated with a given interest space dependent upon its membership at any given time. Such dynamic keyword behavior may be facilitated through indirect association of extracted search keywords with interest spaces . In one embodiment search keywords that are extracted from an access request directed to a particular content source may be directly associated with the particular content source . For example such keywords may be stored within an entry of content source path data structures that corresponds to the particular content source .

Keywords that are directly associated with content sources may then be indirectly associated with the interest spaces of which the content sources are members. For example as mentioned in the previous paragraph a data structure may store a record of the content sources that are members of each interest space . In one embodiment the set of keywords that is associated with a given interest space at a given point in time may be defined as the union of the sets of keywords that are associated with the content sources that are members of the given interest space at the given point in time. Thus if a particular content source ceases to be a member of the given interest space its keywords may no longer be contributed to the keywords associated with given interest space . If no remaining content source contributes a keyword that was associated with the particular content source that keyword may cease to be associated with the given interest space .

It is noted that regardless of whether extracted keywords are directly or indirectly associated with interest spaces the extracted keywords may originate from any number of different search engines. That is the set of keywords associated with an interest space or a given content source may constitute an amalgamation of keywords collected from access requests originating from a variety of different search engines. In some instances extracting keywords from diverse search engine referrers may improve the breadth of keyword association for interest spaces and content sources .

In some embodiments a frequency of occurrence may be stored for each extracted keyword. For example such a frequency may reflect the number of times an access request to a particular content source has included a given extracted keyword. In such embodiments if a keyword has already been stored in association with a content source or interest space creating an association may include incrementing its associated frequency of occurrence. In embodiments where keywords are indirectly associated with interest spaces via member content sources the frequency of occurrence of a given keyword with respect to a given interest space may correspond to the sum of the individual frequencies of occurrence of the given keyword with respect to each content source that is a member of the given interest space . Also in some embodiments extracted keywords may not be permanently associated with content sources or interest spaces but may instead be subject to decay or removal over time. For example an extracted keyword may be disassociated from an interest space or content source after a given amount of time e.g. days weeks months etc. has elapsed since the extracted keyword was last associated with the interest space or content source . In such an embodiment timestamp information may be stored along with the extracted keyword to facilitate determining when a keyword may have become stale. In some such embodiments if a previously associated keyword is subsequently extracted again from an access request its timestamp information may be refreshed.

The various steps illustrated in in some embodiments may be performed by a centralized system configured to receive reported content source request traffic such as IA system . However in other embodiments it is contemplated that some or all steps of the keyword extraction process may be performed in a distributed rather than a centralized fashion. For example some aspects of keyword extraction and processing may be performed by a host prior to or separate from reporting a content source access request to IA system . It is also contemplated that in some embodiments access requests that include search keywords may be discarded following search keyword extraction and may not participate in further interest metric processing such as described above with respect to . For example if the relative volume of request traffic originating from search engines is high it may be desirable to filter such traffic in order to simplify the detection of request traffic patterns from other sources that might otherwise be overshadowed by search engine referral traffic.

As has just been described search keyword information included in access request traffic directed to a particular content source may be associated with one or more interest spaces of which the particular content source is a member. In some embodiments a further association or propagation of keywords may be employed with respect to other content sources within an interest space . For example consider an embodiment in which a given interest space includes three content sources denoted CS CS and CS. Through a search keyword extraction process such as that described above with respect to CS may be associated with keywords A and B CS may be associated with keywords C and D and CS may be associated with keywords E and F. By association the given interest space may be associated with the union of the keywords of the individual content sources or A B C D E and F. In one embodiment each content source within the given interest space may be associated with the set of keywords of the given interest space . That is while each of CS CS and CS may be directly associated with their respective sets of keywords acquired through processing of access requests each of these content sources may also be indirectly associated with the keywords of the others by virtue of their membership within the given interest space . Put another way in such an embodiment a content source may be associated with keywords arising from direct requests to that content source as well as with keywords inherited from other content sources by virtue of a common interest space .

In some embodiments as described previously interest space membership may be dynamic. Correspondingly the keywords associated with a given interest space may depend on the content sources that are its members at any given time. By extension the keywords associated with a particular content source by virtue of the given interest space may also depend on the dynamic membership state of the given interest space . In one embodiment a given content source may be associated with two different types of extracted keywords those keywords stored in direct association with the given content source e.g. those extracted from access requests to the given content source as described above and those keywords stored in direct association with another content source and that are indirectly associated with the given content source by virtue of an interest space . In such an embodiment the given content source may remain indirectly associated with the keywords contributed by other content sources within a given interest space and may contribute its own directly associated keywords to the other content sources in the given interest space contingent upon the given content source s remaining included within the given interest space . If the given content source leaves the given interest space it may retain its directly associated keywords but it may no longer be indirectly associated with the keywords of the other members of the given interest space . Likewise the given content source may no longer contribute its directly associated keywords for indirect association with the other members of the given interest space . Referring to the previous example if CS were to leave the given interest space it may continue to be associated with keywords E and F. However it may cease to be associated with keywords A B C and D unless it remains indirectly associated with these keywords via a different interest space . Similarly following CS s departure CS and CS as well as the given interest space may remain associated with keywords A B C and D but cease to be associated with keywords E and F unless indirectly associated with these keywords via a different interest space .

It is contemplated that in some embodiments IA system may be configured to implement an API through which a requester may identify the extracted keywords that are associated with a given interest space or interest space . The operation of one such embodiment of IA system is illustrated in . In an embodiment in which keywords extracted from access requests to content sources are stored in records respectively associated with those content sources as described above in response to receiving a request to identify the keywords associated with a given interest space block IA system may be configured to identify those content sources that are members of the given interest space block and then retrieve those extracted keywords stored in association with the member content sources block . Similarly in an embodiment that supports the indirect association of keywords among different content sources that are members of a given interest space in response to receiving a request to identify the keywords associated with a particular content source block IA system may be configured to retrieve those keywords stored in direct association with the particular content source block . IA system may further be configured to determine the interest space s of which the particular content source is a member block identify the other content sources that are also members of the determined interest space s block and retrieve those keywords stored in direct association with the identified other content sources block . The retrieved keywords associated with the particular content source and the other content sources may then be returned as a result of the request block . It is noted that in some embodiments retrieval of stored keywords may be included within other types of operations such as identification of interest space membership for example.

Search keywords extracted from access requests and associated with interest spaces may have a number of applications. For example associating keywords with interest spaces may facilitate keyword based search of different interest spaces . In the exemplary method embodiment shown in a user specified set of keywords for an interest space query may be received block . In response the sets of keywords associated with each of a number of different interest spaces may be evaluated against the query keywords block . For example IA system may be configured to compare the query keywords against the keywords retrieved for each interest space defined at the time of the query which may be retrieved e.g. according to the method of . Respective indications of the resultant interest spaces that satisfy the query if any may be displayed to the user block . For example names or summaries of the interest spaces that satisfy the query may be displayed or a graphical representation of a selected number of the resultant interest spaces similar to that described above with respect to may be displayed.

In some embodiments associating search keywords of particular content sources to their parent interest spaces and extending indirect association of such keywords to other content sources within those interest spaces may expand the utility of the search keywords. For example in an advertising context advertisements may be associated with a content source based on keywords associated with that content source . However content sources that are members of a common interest space may reasonably be expected to be related in some fashion. In one embodiment an advertisement may be selected for association with or placement within a given content source dependent upon one or more keywords associated with an interest space of which the given content source is a member where one or more of the keywords are not directly associated with the given content source . Thus referring to the previous example involving CS CS and CS an advertisement may be selected for placement on CS dependent upon keywords A and B even though these keywords may not be directly associated with or appear anywhere within the content of CS. Rather keywords A and B may be deemed applicable to CS by virtue of its common membership in an interest space with CS. By pooling the associations of keywords and content sources in this fashion opportunities for advertising placement may be generated that may not be readily apparent from a placement technique constrained to consider only those keywords directly associated with a content source by a search engine or other method.

As described above with respect to the navigation paths that may exist between content sources may be characterized by path weights. In some embodiments such path weights may be determined according to a function of a frequency with which users traverse the navigation paths as well as a time based rate of decay. For example referral information may be collected and aggregated by IA system to determine for a given content source the various paths from other content sources that users are traversing to reach the given content source . The number of requests reflected in the referral information may be used in determining corresponding path weights.

Certain paths to a given content source may exhibit a considerable overall volume of request traffic. For example a popular search engine or portal may link to a given content source such that the majority of request traffic to the given content source originates from the referring search engine or portal. However as described above with respect to the magnitude of traffic volume may not necessarily be the best indicator of the relative interest of the given content source . In some embodiments a time rate of change of content request traffic along a path may be used to determine the weight of the path. Such a rate of change based weighting scheme may result in significantly different path weighting than a scheme based on traffic volume itself. For example under a rate of change analysis a path having a large but relatively consistent traffic volume may be assigned a smaller weight than a path having fewer requests but that exhibits more variability in traffic volume.

While an analysis of traffic volume along a given path may be one technique for determining a weight for that path other techniques are possible and contemplated. In some embodiments the weight of a path between two content sources may depend both on the content request traffic between the two content sources as well as characteristics of other paths involving the two content sources . For example consider the search engine that refers traffic to a given web page. The search engine may be a particularly strong referrer to the given web page. However the search engine may also be a strong referrer to many other web pages which may dilute the significance of being a strong referrer to the given web page. That is if a given content source refers comparable amounts of request traffic to each of a number of other content sources there may be little to distinguish the paths from the given content source to the other content sources . By contrast if a given content source is a strong referrer to the given web page without referring comparable traffic to other web pages the link between the given content source and the given web page may be regarded as more significant and thus weighted more heavily than the link between the search engine and the given web page.

One embodiment of a method of determining a scaled weight of a navigation path between two content sources denoted content sources A and B is shown in . In some embodiments the method of may be implemented by IA system . For example the method may be included within the general weight determining functionality that may be implemented by TA engine described in detail above.

Operation of the method begins in block where a path weight between content sources A and B is determined. In various embodiments the determined path weight may be dependent upon the raw volume of content request traffic originating from content source A that is directed to content source B a time rate of change of such content request traffic or a linear or nonlinear combination of these and or other traffic related metrics. As noted above in some embodiments the path weight may be determined in a state dependent fashion employing a suitable gain function and the path weight may reflect a time based decay function. In such embodiments the determined path weight may depend at least in part on previously determined path weights. For example gain and decay functions may be employed to enhance or decrease the sensitivity of the path weight to changes in the input conditions determining the weight. It is contemplated that in some embodiments the scaling factor may be used alone as the scaled path weight. In such embodiments determining the path weight between content sources A and B may simply include setting the path weight to an appropriate constant such as 0 or 1 depending on the method in which the path weight and scaling factor are subsequently combined.

A scaling factor corresponding to the navigation path may also be determined such that the scaling factor is directly proportional to the relative frequency of traversals from content source A to content source B compared to all traversals into content source. B and such that the scaling factor is inversely proportional to the relative number of content sources linked to by content source A compared to all content sources within the corpus of previously detected content sources block . That is the magnitude of the scaling factor may be increased to the extent that the path from content source A to content source B is distinguished among the various paths referring to content source B. Additionally the magnitude of the scaling factor may be decreased to the extent that content source A links to many different content sources in addition to content source B. Thus in the example case where content source A corresponds to a search engine that refers significant traffic to content source B but also to many other content sources the inverse factor may balance or dominate the directly proportional factor and the resultant scaling factor will be correspondingly decreased. In the example case where content source A is the only referrer to content source B and content source A does not link to any other content sources the scaling factor may be maximal. One particular method of deriving a scaling factor is described in greater detail below in conjunction with the description of .

The scaling factor and the path weight may then be mathematically combined to generate the scaled path weight block . For example the path weight may be multiplied by or added to the scaling factor. In some embodiments the path weight and the scaling factor may be combined within a linear or nonlinear function and weighted by coefficients or other functions. Scaled path weights produced in this fashion may be stored for later use in any suitable fashion. For example such weights may be used in any of the applications of navigation path weights discussed above such as determination of aggregate paths interest spaces etc.

One embodiment of a particular method of determining a scaling factor is illustrated in . As with the method of described above in some embodiments the method of may be implemented by IA system for example within TA engine . Operation of the method begins in block where a first probability of users traversing a navigation path from a first content source denoted content source A to a second content source denoted content source B is determined. Let Nrefer to the number of user traversals across all navigation paths or links to content source B from all other content sources . Let nrefer to the number of user traversals from content source A to content source B. Then in one embodiment the first probability may be determined as the ratio P n N. The first probability may also be referred to as a local probability that is dependent upon the local frequency of navigation occurrence of the path from content sources A to B relative to the destination B.

A second probability of users traversing navigation paths from content source A to any other content source may be determined block . Let mrefer to the number of content sources within the corpus of content sources e.g. those content sources for which IA system has received notification of content access requests or are otherwise known to IA system that are linked to by content source A that is the number of content sources to which navigation paths exist from content source A. Let M refer to the total number content sources within the corpus of content sources . Then in one embodiment the second probability may be determined as the ratio P m M. The second probability may also be referred to as a global probability that is dependent upon the global frequency of path occurrences from content source A to other content sources relative to the total number of content sources within the corpus. It is noted that in this embodiment the second probability may be dependent on the connectivity or topology of content source A. That is the second probability may be dependent upon the number of paths that exist relative to content source A and not the frequency with which those paths are actually traversed.

A scaling factor indicative of a strength of the navigation path from content source A to content source B relative to other navigation paths that may exist among the corpus of content sources may then be generated block . In one embodiment the scaling factor may be determined as S M P P In such an embodiment as the first or local probability increases the scaling factor may increase while as the second or global probability increases the scaling factor may decrease. In some embodiments the scaling factor may omit the term M which may typically be a constant for any navigation path.

In some embodiments IA system may be configured to store values corresponding to the various terms n N mand M within one or more tables or other data structures in order to facilitate determination of the scaling factor for a given navigation path. For example IA system may be configured to maintain a data structure that reflects data elements corresponding to individual content sources such as content source path data structure described above or another suitable data structure. Within such a data structure IA system may be configured to store for each content source a respective field corresponding to the quantity N and may be configured to update the appropriate field when a content access request to a corresponding content source is detected for example by incrementing the field. IA system may also be configured to store within the same or a different data structure a field corresponding to the number of content sources linked to by a particular content source or m. Such a field may be updated as new links from the particular content source are detected either through processing of content source access request information or through other means. Further IA system may be configured to implement a data structure reflecting traversal information among various pairs of content sources. For example such a data structure may be implemented as a table or other collection of records where each record or entry reflects an indication of an originating content source e.g. a URL corresponding to content source A and a destination content source e.g. a URL corresponding to content source B as well as an indication of the number of traversals of the path n. IA system may be configured to update the number of traversals for a particular path entry for example by incrementing the field value in response to detecting content request traffic indicative of a corresponding path traversal. Finally IA system may be configured to store a global record such as a counter corresponding to the total number M of content sources within the corpus and may be configured to increment the value of M when a new content source is detected.
