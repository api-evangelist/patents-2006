title: Source-to-source transformation for language dialects
abstract: An analysis and source-to-source transformation framework covers dialects of programming languages that lack formal definition for all individual dialects. Multiple instantiations of the same compiler front-end tools can be used with different settings to create distinct intermediate forms and maps. Intermediate forms and maps are used in an individual analysis and source-to-source transformation context, and performing the analysis and source-to-source transformation thereupon. A unified tool set is desirably provided, including standard compiler front-end tools and code transformation/generation tools, wherein source code edits are carried out in order to make the source code more amenable to translation to intermediate forms. The analysis results or intermediate forms created by individual tools are used by other tools as well as further analyzed to create a map of the regions of validity and invalidity of the intermediate forms, and tracking the source-code edits performed in order to obtain the same. Among other benefits, this provides a choice of the best tools combination for maximum code analysis coverage.
