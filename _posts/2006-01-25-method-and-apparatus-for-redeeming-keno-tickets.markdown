This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 646 799 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR REDEEMING KENO TICKETS filed on Jan. 25 2005. This application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates generally to the game of keno and more particularly to methods of and systems for redeeming keno tickets.

Keno is one type of legalized public and private games common in the United States and throughout the world. Keno type games typically draw numerous e.g. 15 to 20 random winning numbers from a larger population of numbers e.g. integers from 1 to 80. Indeed keno type games typically select more winning numbers from the population of numbers than are required to win.

For example to play keno a player may select a minimum of four and no more than 10 numbers between 1 and 80. Each selection is called a spot so if one selects ten numbers the player is said to be playing a ten spot game. The player marks a blank keno card with the selected numbers hands in the ticket e.g. to a clerk at a casino as discussed further below and receives a duplicate ticket in return. Typically about twenty winning numbers are selected from the population of numbers and game participants may win a prize if they match anywhere between zero and ten of the winning numbers. Thus a game participant still can win the top prize without having to match all or even any of the winning numbers drawn. Keno type games typically produce numerous opportunities to match winning numbers and thus many opportunities to win.

Moreover keno type games are flexible because game participants can choose how many winning numbers they would like to try to match in each game. For example participants may select two three or other quantity of numbers up to ten. Correspondingly prizes e.g. cash jackpots are greater when more numbers are matched. Keno prizes generally increase correspondingly with the odds of matching all player chosen numbers. For example the prize for matching five out of five player chosen numbers may be five times greater than the prize for matching two out of two player chosen numbers.

Keno is typically played in casinos and state lotteries. Casinos sell keno tickets to players for example at special counters or through wandering keno ticket sellers. A player can play more than one keno session on a ticket and need not be present in the casino while the keno sessions are being run. The player can return to the casino to see if he or she won any sessions. If the player has won a keno ticket can be redeemed for winnings in the casino. Keno tickets may in some circumstances be redeemed via regular mail. Keno games run by state lotteries sell and redeem tickets in a similar manner to casinos with specified lottery sales locations e.g. bars and restaurants replacing the special keno ticket counters. Keno tickets can also be redeemed at these points of sale POS .

According to one aspect of the present invention it is realized that there is a need for an alternative method for redeeming winning keno tickets that are purchased at a Point of Sale. To this end a system and method is provided for allowing a player to redeem a winning ticket e.g. a keno ticket remotely instead of having to return to a point of purchase or sale of the ticket to redeem the ticket. For example it would be more convenient if the player could redeem the ticket electronically such as over the Internet by email phone or other remote method rather than return to the POS such as a casino or other land based location that allows the sale and redemption of keno tickets. Such a keno type game can be played for example using paper tickets either alone or in combination with a computer system for example over the Internet.

According to another aspect of the present invention it is appreciated that there is an additional benefit provided to game operators of keno games for permitting players to redeem tickets electronically. Specifically there it is appreciated that there is a difference in tax charged to the operator e.g. a casino between keno games that permit different redemption periods after purchase of a ticket. In one example the operator may be charged less federal tax for a shorter redemption period e.g. 24 hours versus a longer redemption period e.g. 90 days . For instance the operator may be charged a lower percentage of the handle by having a shorter redemption period. By permitting players to redeem electronically the game operator may be able to reduce tax by allowing a shorter redemption period. Traditionally keno redemption is limited to methods that require longer redemption periods e.g. by allowing the player to return to a casino to redeem or by permitting the player to redeem winning keno tickets via regular mail . In this way the game operator may minimize tax consequences by offering shorter redemption periods.

According to one aspect of the present invention a method is provided for redeeming a winning keno ticket purchased at a Point of Sale POS wherein the winning keno ticket is redeemed by electronic communication between the player and the gaming operator. In one embodiment of the invention the electronic communication is performed over the Internet. According to another embodiment the electronic communication is performed using e mail. According to another embodiment the electronic communication is performed using instant messaging on the Internet. According to another embodiment the electronic communication is performed using text messaging.

According to another embodiment the game operator is a land based casino. According to another embodiment the game operator is one of a state lottery and a national lottery.

According to another aspect of the present invention a keno game having a plurality of tickets purchased by a plurality of players at a Point of Sale POS is provided comprising at least one winning ticket of the plurality of tickets and an electronic communication means for a player to redeem the winning ticket. According to one embodiment the electronic communication means is over the Internet. According to another embodiment the electronic communication means is by e mail. According to another embodiment the electronic communication is by instant messaging on the Internet. According to another embodiment the electronic communication is by text messaging. According to another embodiment the game operator is a land based casino. According to another embodiment the game operator is at least one of a state and a national lottery.

Further features and advantages of the present invention as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the drawings like reference numerals indicate like or functionally similar elements.

Various aspects of the present invention relate to new methods for redeeming winning keno tickets. Existing methods for redeeming winning keno tickets require that the player return the casino or state lottery agent to have the ticket and the win verified and to obtain any payout. However disadvantages of this redemption method include the following 

Thus according to one aspect a more convenient way is provided for redeeming a keno ticket. In one embodiment of the present invention a player may redeem a keno ticket using a computer system operated by the player the computer system being located outside the betting establishment. In one embodiment the computer system may be coupled to the gaming establishment or other legal jurisdiction through a communication network such as the Internet. According to another embodiment of the present invention a player may redeem a keno ticket using e mail or other electronic communication means.

After the player has purchased one or more keno game sessions the gaming operator may conduct one or more keno game sessions. According to one embodiment the player may be permitted to view the game sessions proceeding at the betting establishment from a location outside of the betting establishment. After one of the keno sessions has concluded the player may redeem his her winnings associated with the particular keno session. To this end the player may be permitted to redeem his her keno entry using a computer coupled to a computer system of the operator through a communication network e.g. including the Internet .

The player may be presented by the computer system an interface used to redeem keno tickets. The interface may be for example the same or similar interface used to view keno results. The interface may permit for example the player to enter information relating to a ticket to be redeemed. For instance the player may enter an identifier of a ticket to be redeemed. Further the interface may include a control that when activate by the player to permit the ticket to be redeemed.

Further the winnings may be caused as a result of the redemption to be transferred to the player. For instance the player may be paid by transferring the winnings to a player s account e.g. a bank account credit line etc. . The account information may be provided to the operator for example by the player at the POS.

Alternatively the player may provide account information to the operator in an interface of a computer system used to redeem keno tickets. The interface may be for example a web based or other type of computer based interface that permits a player operating a computer system to redeem keno tickets. To this end the computer system may be coupled to a keno system through a communication network e.g. including the Internet and may have the capability to transfer control information to the keno system to cause a ticket to be redeemed. In particular the player may be permitted to enter ticket redemption information in the computer system and the information is transferred electronically to the keno system. The computer system and keno system may communicate redemption information using one or more communication protocols e.g. the Transmission Control Protocol TCP User Datagram Protocol UDP etc. .

Once received at the keno system the keno system may transfer the winnings to the player e.g. by transferring funds to an account . The redemption information may include any number of information elements including but not limited to an identifier of the ticket security information associated with the win results and or ticket or any other verifying information.

Such redemption information may be provided to the keno system using other methods. For instance the player may be capable of redeeming tickets via an e mail method. For instance the player may provide ticket identifying information in an e mail message the receipt of which causes the keno system to redeem the ticket and provide the player with any winnings. Similarly the keno system may include other interfaces that permit the player to remotely redeem keno tickets. For example the keno system may include an instant messaging IM interface as is known in the art and can be initiated by a player operating a computer system or any other type of system capable of performing instant messaging. Further the keno system may have a text messaging interface that is capable of receiving a text message e.g. from a cellular phone via a cellular communication network that causes a particular keno ticket to be redeemed.

According to one aspect of the present invention a player may subscribe to multiple keno games using a conventional keno ticket as is known in the art. A typical keno ticket shows all the possible elements in a grid or pattern with the elements a player has chosen being highlighted or otherwise differentiated from the elements that have not been chosen. The typical keno ticket also indicates the keno game sessions that the player is playing and may also indicate when the last game session ends.

Prior to playing a keno game session a game player may need to pay for playing. For example a game player may pay using money or loyalty points. In particular a game player may pay using money by debit card credit card check cash or account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively a game player may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The game player may pay in person using a cashier e.g. at a casino or a state lottery agent .

In one embodiment of the invention players may subscribe to play multiple consecutive keno game sessions. That is the player pays at one time to play many consecutive game sessions. The player may also choose to have his or her subscription automatically renewed.

According to one embodiment of the invention players may also enter to play keno using an alternative method of entry AMOE . AMOE is a required available method of entry into a sweepstakes that does not require a purchase. Sweepstakes are usually used as a promotional or marketing tool. Any company or organization offering a sweepstakes ticket in exchange for a purchase is typically required to also offer an AMOE to the sweepstakes that is not linked to a purchase.

A common AMOE method includes sending by an individual interested in entering the sweepstakes to the sweepstakes offeror a postcard with his or her name address or other contact information. Another AMOE method includes requiring an individual to sign to a free Internet website and submitting the required information for free. Numerous other methods may be used for performing an AMOE. Most sweepstakes limit the number of times one individual or family may enter a sweepstakes by AMOE.

According to one embodiment of the invention it is realized that an AMOE alternative method of entry may be used to enter a game of skill or chance. More particularly it is possible to develop implement and run wagering games of skill or chance including the inventive games described herein with an AMOE method of entry. AMOE methods are conventionally used to enter a player in a sweepstakes which is not considered wagering or gambling. Thus according to one embodiment of the invention an individual may enter a wagering game of skill or chance by AMOE using for example the postcard or the online method outlined above. The wagering game of skill or chance player entering by AMOE may also have the same odds to win the payout associated with the game in which they are entered. The wagering game of skill or chance player entering by AMOE may also be limited to a small number of game sessions within a given period of time for example a player entering by AMOE may be limited to entering one game session in one year or two game sessions in one month. Other numbers of games and given periods may be any number and the invention is not limited to any particular implementation.

An individual entering a sweepstakes by AMOE is required by law to have the same odds of winning each of the available prizes as do individuals who have paid for entry e.g. by making a purchase of a product or service .

According to one embodiment of the invention it is realized that an AMOE alternative method of entry may be used to enter a keno game session. More particularly it is possible to develop implement and run keno games with an AMOE method of entry as is usually associated with sweepstakes. An individual may enter the keno game session by AMOE using the postcard or the online methods outlined above. The keno game player entering by AMOE has the same odds to win the payout associated with the game session in which they are entered as do any other players who have paid for entry. The keno game player entering by AMOE may also be limited to a small number of game sessions within a given period of time. For example the player may be limited to entering one game session in one year or two game sessions in one month. Other numbers of sessions and given periods may be any number and the invention is not limited to any particular implementation.

According to one embodiment the game session that the game player entering by AMOE is entered into may be determined by the game player on the AMOE entry form. For example the post card AMOE may be required to state the date and the time of the game session that the game player wants to enter. Alternatively the game session entered may be the next starting game session after the AMOE is received and logged. As another alternative AMOE entries may be assigned to a specific game session s each hour day week or other time interval.

According to one embodiment a keno game session has a predetermined payout table associated with it. The payout table may have a listing of the ways to obtain a payout and its payout amount. Possible ways to obtain a payout include matching all some or none of the player chosen elements with the randomly chosen winning elements for a specific keno game session. The payout amount for each way to win may depend upon but may not be rigidly determined by the odds of obtaining the particular way to obtain a payout in the predetermined fixed number of drawn winning elements for example the odds of matching ten player chosen elements with twenty winning elements drawn may be twice that for twenty player chosen elements but the payout may be only one and one half times higher for matching the twenty player elements chosen versus ten player chosen elements.

The payout table may also have adjustments for a player s subscription. For instance the payout may increase if the player has a multiple game session subscription or high payment per game session. The payout may also be adjusted for numerous other criterion including frequent player credits. Of course all payout adjustments must meet any legal requirements for the gaming jurisdiction in which the game is played.

The payout table for each game session may also be supplemented by a jackpot that transfers from game session to game session. These types of jackpots are commonly called rolling or progressive jackpots. A rolling jackpot may be the same amount that transfers from game session to game session until it is paid out. A progressive jackpot is a rolling jackpot that increases as more game sessions game cards or other criterion are played. Rolling or progressive jackpots are typically paid out for a difficult way to match the player chosen elements with the drawn winning elements of a game session e.g. matching twenty player chosen elements with twenty drawn winning elements.

The final payout may also be affected as to whether the game session has a fixed payout for a win or whether the payout is shared. If the payout is fixed for a win all players that have a game session winner for a certain type of win may be paid the amount listed in the payout table for the win. According to one embodiment each player is playing solely against the game operator. According to another example if the payout is shared then all players that have a game session winner for a certain type of win may be paid a total of the amount listed in the payout table. Each player may receive a share of the total payout depending upon how much he or she paid for the game or any other legal criteria.

The final payout may also be affected by bonus play. Bonus play is well known in the gaming industry and works to increase some payouts by offering the chance to multiply a payout.

One or more sessions may proceed concurrently the parameters of the concurrent game sessions may be the same similar or different. For example the drawn winning elements may be used for one or more concurrent sessions if the predetermined set of elements is the same for the one or more concurrent sessions.

One or more game sessions may proceed concurrently. Parameters of concurrent game sessions may be the same similar or different. Additionally game sessions may run continually i.e. one after another. When one game session ends another game session may begin immediately or in a short period of time. Game sessions may follow a precise time schedule so that players know when games will begin. For example if game play in a game session requires four and a half 4.5 minutes to complete then the next game session may start immediately or in a defined period e.g. thirty seconds to maintain to a schedule of game sessions. For instance game sessions may begin every five minutes e.g. at 00 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 of each hour . Because according to one embodiment game sessions may run continually it may be possible that a particular game session may have no game player playing within the particular game session.

Prior to a game session the game player may choose from the predetermined set of elements for a particular game session. A game player may choose the elements for trying to match the drawn winning elements for a game session manually or using a computer system. Alternatively according to one embodiment of the invention a computer system may automatically choose the player chosen elements for a game player. Because a computer system can both choose the player chosen elements and draw the winning elements a player need not configure and attend each game playing session as discussed further below.

The predetermined set of elements may be any letter or character number symbol color logo shape drawing or other item that may be represented. The element may be a letter or character of any one or more languages including but not limited to English Russian Japanese Chinese or Greek. The element may also be any random combination of letters or characters including words and phrases. The element may also be a number of any language including but not limited to English Chinese or Roman and the number may be represented by items. For example the number of stars in the cell or the dots on the face of a die or dice. The number may be negative zero positive integer fraction decimal real or imaginary and in one example the number is preferably a positive integer. The element may also be a symbol from anywhere such as for example astrology religion printing and computer fonts road signs or law. The element may be any color including but not limited to black white or shades of gray. The element may also be a logo of a company or product name or trademark.

The winning elements for a game session may be randomly drawn by hand or by computer system from the predetermined set of elements for the game session. When the drawing is by hand the winning elements may be chosen from pieces of paper drawn out of a hat or drum by using balls or discs in a rotating or air blown sphere or any other method that can be used for drawing elements for a keno type game. The hand drawn winning elements may then be displayed or entered into a computer system. In one preferred embodiment the winning element s is randomly drawn by computer system from the predetermined set of elements for a particular game session.

The game player may view the game proceedings using television wireless or line telephone with display handheld device kiosk computer or in person depending upon the viewing medium it may be necessary to download game information prior to viewing while other viewing medium may allow viewing of the streamed game information. For example the game player may operate a computer system that has an Internet enabled interface e.g. using Macromedia Flash or Java and the computer system may display streamed game information within that interface.

According to one embodiment a player may purchase one or more keno tickets from a vendor as described above. After all the drawn winning elements are drawn for a game session a player may check the ticket for a winning number of matching elements and then inform the game operator that the keno ticket is a winner. If the game player is playing the game remotely for instance over the web or interactive television or if the game operator is a computer system then the player may use e mail instant messaging or other electronic or voice indication method e.g. the telephone to notify the game operator of the winning keno ticket. The game operator would then authenticate and verify the game player and the winning keno ticket. The game operator would then verify that the game player won by checking the keno ticket against the drawn winning elements for the appropriate game sessions. Methods for ticket verification are well known in the remote and electronic gaming industry.

As stated above it may also be possible that a game card may be a winner because of not matching the drawn winning elements. For example in a game session with forty drawn winning elements out of a predetermined set of elements containing seventy five items a keno ticket that has no matches in a specific game session may have a payout equivalent to a keno ticket matching ten out of ten player chosen elements to the forty drawn winning elements.

During the period of time between the game sessions a game operator may make announcements rest or any number of actions. If the game is played using a computer system then advertisements sponsorships public service announcements or any visual or auditory content may be inserted. The advertisements etc. may also be inserted into the game display during a game session.

A game player may also be able to replay or review a past game session using a video device including kiosk telephone with display television computer or handheld device. By accessing the proper game session in the computer system a game player may be able to see a past game session as it occurred the winning tickets and winning game player identity ies the drawn winning elements or possibly any other aspect of the game session of interest.

According to another embodiment of the invention the game its game sessions and the game play are partially or fully operated using one or more computer systems. A computer system may be a single computer that may be a supercomputer minicomputer or a mainframe or personal computer. A computer system may also be any multiple and combination of computer types that work together multiple computer systems may also be needed to run the whole game. The computer system also may include input or output devices displays and or storage units.

A computer system to run the game described above may include one or more component systems e.g. system as shown in . One system e.g. item as shown in may handle payment subscription and or AMOE by players to enter the game. Another system e.g. item as shown in may handle playing and viewing the game and another system e.g. item as shown in may handle payouts. The game system may also be connected by direct line or network to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs reservations in room television viewing or gambling floor kiosks. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.

A payment component e.g. system may include one or more of a number of well known systems e.g. as shown in . For example a player may be able to pay to play one or more games using a telephone and speaking with a call center representative who manually inputs player payment and subscription information into a computer using a user interface. As used herein a data structure is an arrangement of data defined by computer readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system stored on a medium associated with a computer system e.g. in a memory on a disk etc. and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as for example a network. Also as used herein a user interface or UI is an interface between a human user and a computer that enables communication between a user and a computer. Types of UIs include a graphical user interface GUI a display screen a mouse a keyboard a keypad a track ball a microphone e.g. to be used in conjunction with a voice recognition system a speaker a touch screen a game controller e.g. a joystick etc. and any combinations thereof.

Player information may also be entered into a payment system component. Player information that may be input includes name address telephone number and age. Payment information associated with the player may include a credit or debit card number or loyalty account information. Subscription information for games to which the player subscribes may include first game date and time number of games to play and bet per game. Based upon the payment and subscription information the call center representative may then verify that the payment information is valid and that enough credit or funds is available for the player s desired subscription.

A similar system may exist for players entering using the mail or a post card AMOE except the call center may be replaced by a mail center having representatives that enter information into one or more computers via a user interface. For example a cashier that works at a casino directly with players that pay cash or credit to play may also have the ability to input player account and subscription information using a user interface of a computer system.

Computer systems or pay engines for handling electronic or online payment and subscriptions may also be used. Such systems are well known and include such systems as PAYPAL system IKOBO system VERISIGN system and other systems. Using such a system a player interacts directly with a user interface to input information into a payment data structure that may be transferred to one or more payment systems e.g. PAYPAL system .

Various pay systems and one or more user interfaces may be located on one or more computer systems coupled by a network with the computer system s containing the player account and subscription database s . As used herein a network or a communications network is a group of two or more devices interconnected by one or more segments of transmission media and or active devices on which communications may be exchanged between the devices. Each segment may be any of a plurality of types of transmission media including one or more electrical or optical wires or cables made of metal and or optical fiber air e.g. using wireless transmission over carrier waves or any combination of these transmission media.

The above are merely an illustrative embodiment of a pay system component. It should be appreciated that such an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as any of numerous other implementations of a pay system component for example variations of online payment are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. For example the payment system component may include using pay per view systems associated with interactive television or the pay engine may additionally deliver a receipt to the player by either e mail or mail. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of the pay system unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.

Payout systems are also well known. Any of a number of standard systems or payout engines for making payouts for winning may be used. For example a standard application programming interface such as QUICKEN application available commercially from Intuit Inc. Mountain View California USA may be used to write and mail checks or credit a debit card credit card if legal in the jurisdiction of play or loyalty account. QUICKEN application may obtain the payout information by accessing a payout data structure across a network. As used herein an application programming interface or API is a set of one or more computer readable instructions that provide access to one or more other sets of computer readable instructions that define functions so that such functions can be configured to be executed on a computer in conjunction with an application program.

 QUICKEN application is merely an illustrative embodiment of the payout system. Such an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as any of numerous other implementations of the payout system for example variations of online payout are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention. Additionally a cashier may also have access to payout information using a user interface to the payout data structure through a network the cashier then makes a payment to the winning player based upon the accessed information. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of the pay system unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.

A game playing and viewing system e.g. system according to one embodiment of the present invention may comprise of a number of components for performing specific functions as shown in . These components may include for example storage components that store data structures having information relating to storing game variations present game session information game session history and win history. A game playing and viewing system may also include components used to access payment and payout data structures.

The game playing and viewing system may also include a game engine. According to one embodiment the game engine may perform numerous functions including drawing winning elements for a game session and displaying the drawn winning elements through any communication means including on a call board on the casino floor over the Internet e.g. through a website or internet messaging or e mail or by text messaging on a cell phone. The game playing and viewing system may also receive communication from players indicating a winning keno ticket communication may be received through any means including over the Internet e.g. through a website internet messaging or e mail or by text messaging on a cell phone.
