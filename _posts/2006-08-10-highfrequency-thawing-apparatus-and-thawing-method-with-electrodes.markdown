The present invention relates to a high frequency thawing apparatus and a thawing method for executing thawing processing by applying high frequency waves to a frozen material such as meat and fish and seafood done with freezing processing.

A high frequency thawing apparatus that executes thawing processing by applying high frequency waves to a frozen material such as the one described in Patent Document 1 has been known. This high frequency thawing apparatus is configured to supply a frozen material with high frequency power from a high frequency oscillator via a pair of opposing electrodes while the frozen material is sandwiched between the opposing electrodes so that the frozen material sandwiched between the opposing electrodes is thawed by dielectric heating that takes place upon supply of high frequency power.

Incidentally the high frequency thawing apparatus described in Patent Document 1 adopts a configuration to generate a uniform electric field within a material to be heated by covering a frozen material with a pair of opposing electrodes in a reliable manner. In a case of such opposing electrodes however energy of high frequency waves tends to concentrate on the boundary of a medium that is the crest edge portion of the frozen material and this portion is heated more readily than the other portions which poses a problem that the frozen material is not thawed uniformly.

In particular in a case where the frozen material is meat because the frozen material is heated by means of dielectric heating produced by high frequency waves combined with a Joule heat on top of that the dielectric loss and the electric conductivity of fat contained in the meat are high when the fat falls on the crest edge portion of the frozen meat the crest edge portion of the thawed meat comes to a boil. This causes an inconvenience that the commercial value is declined.

An object of the invention is to provide a high frequency thawing apparatus and a thawing method which enables to apply thawing processing to a frozen material always uniformly and properly.

A high frequency thawing apparatus according to an aspect of the invention executes thawing processing by means of dielectric heating by applying high frequency power to a frozen material processed in a required thickness in a thawing section. The thawing section includes first opposing electrodes whose at least one of electrodes to sandwich the frozen material has a shape of a plate in a size smaller than a shape of a sandwiched surface of the frozen material second opposing electrodes whose at least one of electrodes to sandwich the frozen material has a shape of a plate in a size larger than the shape of the plate in the smaller size and a high frequency wave supply portion that supplies the frozen material with high frequency power via the second opposing electrodes after the high frequency power is supplied to the frozen material via the first opposing electrodes.

According to the high frequency thawing apparatus of the invention the processed frozen material is formed into a three dimensional shape having a required thickness such as a substantially square prism or a cylindrical column of a specific dimension size determined in advance. Regarding the first opposing electrodes to sandwich such a frozen material at least one of the electrodes is made to have a shape of a plate in a size smaller than the shape of the sandwiched surface of the frozen material. Hence at the initial stage of the thawing processing the crest edge portion of the frozen material is subjected to the thawing processing by high frequency heating at a lower level than in the other portions by avoiding concentration of energy of high frequency waves. It is thus possible to eliminate an inconvenience that the crest edge portion of the frozen material is overheated at the initial stage of the thawing processing and the thawed state becomes inhomogeneous. In addition regarding the second opposing electrodes used in the second step of the thawing processing because at lest one of the electrodes has a shape of a plate in a size larger than the shape of the plate in the smaller size of the first opposing electrodes the crest edge portion of the frozen material is covered with the opposing electrodes almost completely or in a reliable manner. Hence the crest edge portion of the frozen material that has not been thawed sufficiently by the first opposing electrodes is more readily heated than the other portions by this configuration combined with concentration of energy of high frequency waves. The frozen material can be therefore thawed uniformly in a state where there is no significant variance in the thawing temperature when the thawing processing by high frequency heating is completed.

As shown in a high frequency thawing apparatus includes a carrier mechanism carrier means that carries a frozen material R into an apparatus main body of a box shape lengthened in the front back direction right left direction of from the front end to the rear end of the apparatus main body opposing electrodes disposed oppositely at top and bottom to apply high frequency waves to the frozen material R carried by the carrier mechanism an elevation mechanism that moves up and down an electrode first through third top electrode groups and described below which is one of the opposing electrodes provided at the top and a high frequency oscillator high frequency wave supply portion provided onto a top board of the apparatus main body .

A thawing section of the invention includes the carrier mechanism the opposing electrodes and the high frequency oscillator .

In order to support the carrier mechanism the apparatus main body has a crosswise pair of supporting frames extending in the front back direction at the bottom portion thereof. Each supporting frame has a front back length longer than the length of the apparatus main body and each has plural supporting columns provided to protrude downward at regular pitches over the full length in the longitudinal direction. A front wall of the apparatus main body is provided with a carry in port which is a notch running upward from the bottom edge portion. The carry in port is adapted for carrying the frozen material R into the apparatus main body . A back wall of the apparatus main body is provided with a carry out port of a shape similar to that of the carry in port . The carry out port is adapted for carrying out the frozen material R from the inside to the outside of the apparatus main body .

Each of the carry in port and the carry out port is provided with a partition board configured to be capable of moving up and down and opening and closing means for opening and closing the carry in port or carry out port by moving up and down the partition board . The opening and closing means includes a crosswise pair of opening and closing air cylinders provided in a portrait orientation at the upper position of the front wall and the back wall and a piston rod that travels forward and backward in a downward direction from each opening and closing air cylinder . The lower end portion of each piston rod is coupled to the partition board so that the carry in port and the carry out port are opened and closed as the piston rods move up and down with respect to the opening and closing air cylinders .

A control device formed of a micro computer is disposed at an appropriate position in the apparatus main body . In addition a console panel for input operations of the operating conditions of the high frequency thawing apparatus is provided at an appropriate position on the outside wall of the apparatus main body . The control device sets the operating conditions on the basis of operation information inputted via the console panel and outputs a control signal according to the operating conditions to related equipment. The high frequency thawing apparatus is configured to operate properly as the related equipment is driven by the control signal.

As shown in the carrier mechanism includes a drive roller that is concentric with a drive roller shaft installed between the front ends of the pair of supporting frames and axially supported thereon to be able to rotate as one piece a driven roller that is concentric with a driven roller shaft installed between the rear ends of the pair of supporting frames and axially supported thereon to be free to rotate a carrying belt stretched over the drive roller and the driven roller a driving motor that is disposed below the drive roller and transmits a driving force to the drive roller and a driving belt stretched over a drive pulley that is concentric with a driving shaft of the driving motor and externally fitted thereto to be able to rotate as one piece and the drive roller . The frozen material R is moved and placed on the upstream end front end of the carrying belt by delivery means such as a work robot while the carry in port is opened by an ascent of the partition board . The frozen material R is then carried into the apparatus main body as the carrying belt is turned around between the drive roller and the driven roller by the driving of the driving motor .

In order to enable opening and closing actions of the carry in port and the carry out port and elevation actions of the first through third top electrode groups and forming the counter electrode and described below the driving motor is configured to be driven at specific timings. More specifically a frozen material R supplied from upstream is carried into a thawing space V inside the apparatus main body by the driving of the driving motor while the carry in port and the carry out port are opened and the first through third top electrode groups and are moved up and at the same time a frozen material R done with the thawing processing is carried out from the thawing space V to the outside.

It is configured in such a manner that the thawing processing is executed as high frequency power from the high frequency oscillator is supplied to a frozen material R carried into the thawing space V via a top electrode that has descended to a position spaced apart by a specific distance for example 5 mm to 10 mm from the top surface of the frozen material R while the driving motor is suspended intermittently. In other words the frozen material R is moved intermittently within the thawing space V by the intermittent driving of the driving motor so that it is subjected to high frequency power supply processing while the driving motor is suspended.

The descended top electrode is brought into a state where it is spaced apart by the specific distance from the top surface of the frozen material R by taking into account the presence of a variance in thickness of the frozen material R. More specifically in a case where it is configured in such a manner that the top electrode abuts on the top surface of the frozen material R the top electrode abuts on the top surface of the frozen material R only in part due to the variance in thickness. High frequency power is therefore supplied intensively only to the portion on which the top electrode is abutting in the top surface of the frozen material R which raises an inconvenience that this portion is overheated. In order to prevent the occurrence of such an inconvenience in the invention the top electrode is spaced apart from the top surface of the frozen material R by a distance equal to or larger than a range of variance in thickness of the frozen material R. In this embodiment the spaced apart distance is set in a range of 5 mm to 10 mm. In the invention however the spaced apart distance is not limited to 5 mm to 10 mm and an adequate spaced apart distance is set as the need arises by taking a variance in thickness into account.

The opposing electrodes include the top electrode provided at the top and a bottom electrode provided at the bottom with the top turning portion outgoing region of the carrying belt in between. The bottom electrode has a width dimension substantially the same as the width dimension of the carrying belt and also has a length dimension slightly shorter than the length dimension front back dimension of the carrying belt . The top electrode is formed by providing plural unit electrodes successively from upstream front end to downstream. These unit electrodes form a first top electrode group a second top electrode group and a third top electrode group from upstream.

Each unit electrode is of a rectangular shape when viewed from above and the four corners thereof are formed in the shape of a circular arc. This configuration prevents an event that energy concentrates on the four corners of the unit electrode while high frequency power is applied to the frozen material R via the unit electrode thereby causing partial overheating at the corners. By comparison when the corners of the unit electrode are square energy concentrates on the square portions and portions of the frozen material R opposing these square portions are overheated.

The first top electrode group and the bottom electrode form first opposing electrodes of the invention and the second top electrode group and the bottom electrode form second opposing electrodes of the invention.

On the outgoing side of the carrying belt a first thawing space V is defined between the first top electrode group and the bottom electrode a second thawing space V is defined between the second top electrode group and the bottom electrode and a third thawing space V is defined between the third top electrode group and the bottom electrode . Curing spaces in which no high frequency power is applied to the frozen material R are defined between the first thawing space V and the second thawing space V and between the second thawing space V and the third thawing space V.

In this embodiment the thawing space V V through V is divided equally into three parts in the width direction as is indicated by phantom lines of shown as chain double dashed lines in and divided equally into 23 parts in the front back direction. The first top electrode group is formed of nine unit electrodes disposed individually into a total of nine cells in three columns on the upstream end partitioned by the phantom line. The second top electrode group is formed of 18 unit electrodes disposed by skipping six cells in two columns downstream from the first top electrode group in six columns directly downstream from the skipped columns. The third top electrode group is formed of 30 unit electrodes disposed by skipping six cells in two columns downstream from the second top electrode group in ten columns directly downstream from the skipped columns.

Of the frozen materials R successively sent from the upstream process three frozen materials R in one column are supplied to the upstream end of the carrying belt and introduced into the thawing space V by the carrying belt that performs intermittently a turning action for one cell at a time in a specific cycle. As the top electrode moves up and down in synchronization with the introduction of the frozen materials R into the thawing space V high frequency waves are applied first to the frozen materials R sandwiched between the unit electrodes in the first top electrode group and the bottom electrode . High frequency application is applied three times to the three frozen materials R in one column in the first top electrode group by the intermittent turning actions of the carrying belt .

Subsequently the three frozen materials R in one column to which high frequency application processing has been applied three times in specific cycles in the first top electrode group are subjected to the curing processing processing to make the temperature uniform through heat conduction inside the frozen materials R without applying high frequency waves for a time comparable to two specific cycles after which they are subjected to high frequency application processing six times in specific cycles in the second top electrode group .

Subsequently the three frozen materials R in one column to which the high frequency application processing has been applied six times in specific cycles in the second top electrode group are subjected to the curing processing for a time comparable to two specific cycles in the same manner as above after which they are subjected to the high frequency application processing ten times in specific cycles in the third top electrode group whereupon the thawing processing is completed. The frozen materials R done with the thawing processing three at a time are carried out from the thawing space V to the outside.

The elevation mechanism is adapted for moving up and down the top electrode . The elevation mechanism includes an electrode supporting plate made of metal to which plural unit electrodes are attached to the lower surface and plural cylinder devices that move up and down the electrode supporting plate . The electrode supporting plate is formed into a rectangular shape using an insulation material and a hard synthetic resin material and it includes three kinds for the first top electrode group the second top electrode group and the third top electrode group .

The electrode supporting plate for the first top electrode group is made to have a dimension large enough to cover nine unit electrodes arrayed in three rows and three columns. The electrode supporting plate for the second top electrode group is made to have a dimension large enough to cover unit electrodes arrayed in three rows and six columns. The electrode supporting plate for the third top electrode group is made to have a dimension large enough to cover unit electrodes arrayed in three rows and ten columns.

Each cylinder device has an elevation air cylinder provided in a portrait orientation and a piston rod protruding from the elevation air cylinder to be able to travel backward and forward in a downward direction. The elevation air cylinder is fixed in a portrait orientation onto a shelf board that partitions the interior of the apparatus main body to top and bottom portions and the piston rod is provided to protrude downward by penetrating through the shelf board . The electrode supporting plate is connected to the lower end portion of the piston rod . It is configured in such a manner that the electrode supporting plate moves down or moves up as the piston rod travels backward and forward with respect to the elevation air cylinder by the driving of the cylinder device .

In this embodiment the cylinder device has four piston rods for the first top electrode group six piston rods for the second top electrode group and ten piston rods for the third top electrode group .

When high frequency power is applied to the frozen materials R the frozen material R is positioned between the top electrode unit electrode at the lower end of the piston rod moved down in the thawing space V by the driving of the corresponding cylinder device and the bottom electrode with the carrying belt in between. Meanwhile when the frozen materials R are carried inside the thawing space V a spaced apart distance between the top electrode at the lower end of the piston rod moved up by the driving of the corresponding cylinder device and the top surface of the frozen material R is increased. The top electrode is moved up when the frozen materials R are moved so as to avoid the occurrence of interference between the frozen materials R and the top electrode . However in a case where the dimension accuracy of the frozen materials R is so high that irregularities are hardly present on the top surface the top electrode may be maintained at a specific height position set in advance without moving up or down the top electrode .

A compressed air source is formed of a press pump a pressure container to store compressed air and so forth and supplies driving compressed air to the elevation air cylinders of the elevation mechanism and the opening and closing air cylinders of the opening and closing means . Compressed air from the compressed air source passes through a first air tube to be supplied to a pair of opening and closing air cylinders via a first valve gear while it passes through a second air tube to be supplied to all the elevation air cylinders via a second valve gear .

The first air tube and the second air tube are illustrated schematically in the drawing. In practice however the former is provided in a plural form to be headed toward the both end portions of the cylinders the opening and closing air cylinders and the elevation air cylinders and equipped with tubes for air bleeding and various switching valves and because these are conventional art they are not shown in the drawing. The same can be said for the second air tube .

Also plural control valves are adopted for the first valve gear and the second valve gear and it is configured in such a manner that the opening and closing action of the partition board and the elevation action of the top electrode are controlled by allowing the respective valves to perform the opening and closing actions in association with the other control valves. Because they are conventional art too they are not shown in the drawing.

In this embodiment three oscillators a first oscillator for the first top electrode group a second oscillator for the second top electrode group and a third oscillator for the third top electrode group are provided as the high frequency oscillator . In this embodiment the first through third oscillators and have the same specification that is the same output . The invention however is not limited to the configuration in which the first through third oscillators and all having the same output are adopted and those having different outputs can be adopted as well.

A power supply device is adapted for obtaining specific power from the commercial power supply and supplies the first through third oscillators and with power. It is configured in such a manner that the first oscillator applies a high frequency voltage to the respective unit electrodes in the first top electrode group the second oscillator applies a high frequency voltage to the respective unit electrodes in the second top electrode group and the third oscillator applies a high frequency voltage to the unit electrodes in the third top electrode group .

Hence because there are nine unit electrodes in the first top electrode group let Q kW be the output from one high frequency oscillator then power supplied to each unit electrode is Q 9 kW . Meanwhile because there are 18 unit electrodes in the second top electrode group power supplied to each unit electrode in the second top electrode group is Q 18 kW . Also because there are 30 unit electrodes in the third top electrode group power supplied to each unit electrode in the third top electrode group is Q 30 kW .

The above description indicates that an amount of power supplied to a single unit electrode in the second top electrode group is Q 18 Q 9 of the amount of power in the first top electrode group and an amount of power supplied to a single unit electrode in the third top electrode group is about Q 30 Q 9 of the amount of power in the first top electrode group .

This power distribution makes it possible to prevent the frozen materials R from being overheated with a progress in the thawing processing by high frequency application to the frozen materials R. It is thus possible to prevent the internal temperature distribution of the frozen materials R from becoming inhomogeneous.

In the invention as shown in the unit electrode for the first top electrode group has the smallest dimension among the three kinds of unit electrodes when viewed from above the unit electrode for the second top electrode group has the medium dimension among the three kinds and the unit electrode for the third top electrode group has the largest dimension among the three kinds. shows a case where a unit electrode is larger than the frozen material R as a comparative example for reference purpose.

In this embodiment a subject is a block of frozen material R having a dimension in length right left dimension width front back dimension and height thickness dimension of 530 mm 360 mm 170 mm. The unit electrode for the first top electrode group is made to have the lengthwise and crosswise dimensions of 370 mm 250 mm. As shown in the crest edge portion on the top of a block of frozen material R lies off outward from the unit electrode for the first top electrode group.

The unit electrode for the second top electrode group is made to have the lengthwise and crosswise dimensions of 420 mm 280 mm. As shown in a lying off amount of the crest edge portion on the top of a block of frozen material R from the unit electrode for the second top electrode group is smaller than in the case of the unit electrode for the first top electrode group.

The unit electrode for the third top electrode group is made to have the lengthwise and crosswise dimensions of 480 mm 320 mm. As shown in a lying off amount of the crest edge portion on the top of a block of frozen material R from the unit electrode for the third top electrode group is extremely small.

The reason why the lying off amounts are varied stepwise in this manner is as follows. That is at the initial stage where the frozen material R is subjected to thawing processing by the first top electrode group it is effective to execute the thawing processing quickly by supplying the frozen material R with a large amount of energy from the high frequency oscillator in terms of enhancing efficiency for the overall thawing processing. However when configured as described above as shown in FIG. Db energy of high frequency waves concentrates on the crest edge portion of the frozen material R and the crest edge portion of the frozen material R is consequently overheated which makes it impossible to thaw the frozen material R with a uniform temperature distribution.

In a case where the frozen material R is frozen meat fat having high dielectric loss and electric conductivity and present in the crest edge portion of a block of frozen meat is readily subjected to dielectric heating and Joule heating and this portion becomes a so called boiled state. This causes an inconvenience that the commercial value of the thawed material is declined markedly.

Given these circumstances as are shown in FIG. Aa through FIG. Ca the unit electrodes are configured in such a manner that the unit electrode for the first top electrode group having the largest amount of energy conferred to the frozen material R per unit electrode is made to have the smallest area the unit electrode for the second top electrode group having the second largest amount of energy conferred to the frozen material R per unit electrode is made to be slightly larger than the unit electrode for the first top electrode group and the unit electrode for the last third top electrode group set with the smallest amount of energy conferred to the frozen material R per unit electrode is made to be the largest.

Hence when the frozen material R is carried into the first thawing space V and sandwiched between the bottom electrode and the unit electrode for the first top electrode group via the carrying belt as shown in FIG. Ab energy indicated by a dotted line for ease of illustration supplied between the unit electrode for the first top electrode group and the bottom electrode flows while deviating considerably from the crest edge portion on the top of the frozen material R. Hence even when a large amount of energy is supplied to the frozen material R during the initial stage of thawing it is possible to prevent the crest edge portion of the frozen material R from being overheated in a reliable manner.

Incidentally the frozen material R delivered from the upstream process at about 20 C. is heated to about 10 C. in the first thawing space V.

Subsequently because the frozen material R done with the thawing processing in the first thawing space V and sent into the second thawing space V has been heated to about 10 C. an amount of energy per unit time conferred to the frozen material R is reduced to about the amount in the case of the first thawing space V so that the thawing processing is applied to the frozen material R gently over a longer time about two times longer than the time in the case of the first thawing space V .

Accordingly in the second thawing space V although high frequency waves are applied to the frozen material R by the unit electrode for the second top electrode group having a slightly larger plane dimension than the unit electrode for the first top electrode group in the first thawing space V the degree of concentration of energy to the crest edge portion of the frozen material R is not so high. Hence not only is it possible to suppress overheating of the crest edge portion but rather it is also possible to apply the thawing processing to the crest edge portion by resolving a state of not having been heated in the first thawing space V. Incidentally the frozen material R delivered from the first thawing space V at about 10 C. is heated to about 5 C. in the second thawing space V.

For the frozen material R done with thawing processing in the second thawing space V and sent into the third thawing space V an amount of energy per unit time conferred to the frozen material R is reduced to about the amount in the case of the first thawing space V so that the thawing processing is applied to the frozen material R more gently over a further longer time about three times longer than the time in the case of the first thawing space V .

Hence in the third thawing space V high frequency waves are applied to the frozen material R by the unit electrode for the third top electrode group having a considerably larger plane dimension than the unit electrode for the second top electrode group in the second thawing space V and substantially the same lengthwise and crosswise dimensions as the frozen material R. However because the energy of the high frequency waves has become considerably low the frozen material R is subjected to heating uniformly over a longer time thereafter.

Incidentally the frozen material R delivered from the second thawing space V at about 5 C. is heated to about 3 C. in the third thawing space V and the thawing processing ends in this state.

The ROM is a read only memory device and has stored a program to cause the control device to function invariable data and so forth. The RAM is used as an area to write in data used for a control action temporarily and read out the data later.

The CPU includes an operating condition setting portion that sets the operating conditions on the basis of operation information inputted from the console panel and a control signal output portion that outputs a control signal to the high frequency oscillator the driving motor and the first and second valve gears and according to a command signal from the operating condition setting portion .

The control device is configured in such a manner that it starts up when the power supply switch is depressed and supplies specific power from the power supply device to wherever necessary the high frequency oscillator the driving motor and so forth in the high frequency thawing apparatus .

The LCD displays input information from the operating information input key and the numeric keypad as well as output information regarding the control from the operating condition setting portion or the like. The operator by visually confirming the content displayed on the LCD becomes able to check the information that is just inputted and confirm the operating status of the high frequency thawing apparatus .

The operating information input key includes at least a food kind key to input the kind of frozen materials R a food dimension key to input three dimensions lengthwise dimension crosswise dimension height dimension of the frozen materials R a numerical quantity key to input a numerical quantity of frozen materials R subjected to the thawing processing and a weight key to input the weight of the frozen materials R.

In a case where the kind of frozen materials R is inputted when the food kind key is depressed a message input the kind of frozen materials using numeric keypad is displayed on the LCD and the operator is requested to input a numerical character specifying the corresponding pre encoded kind of food. In a case where the three dimensions of the frozen materials R is inputted after the food dimension key is depressed the operator is allowed to input numerical values of the length width and height using the numeric keypad . Also in a case where the numerical quantity of the frozen materials R subjected to the thawing processing is inputted the numerical quantity key is depressed after which the operator is allowed to input the numerical quantity using the numeric keypad . Further in a case where the weight of the frozen materials R is inputted after the weight key is depressed the operator is allowed to input the weight using the numeric keypad .

In addition to the input direction using the numeric keypad as described above item keys assigned to the respective kinds of food to be thawed for example beef key A pork key B chicken key C may be provided so that the dimension and weight of an item are automatically inputted by merely depressing any of the item keys. In the case of the configuration described above because the frozen materials R have the dimension and the weight rated for each kind by pre storing these in the control device described below it is possible to eliminate the need of a bothering work to input the dimension and the weight using the numeric keypad each and every time. It is thus possible to enhance the workability relating to operations of the high frequency thawing apparatus .

In order to support input operations from the operating information input key a food code correspondence table in which for example the kinds of the frozen materials Rand the code numbers are correlated with each other is stored in the ROM so that when the food kind key is depressed the food code correspondence table is read out and displayed on the LCD . The operator is therefore able to perform input operations with ease using the numeric keypad by referring to the food code correspondence table displayed on the LCD .

The operating condition setting portion is adapted for setting the operating conditions of the high frequency thawing apparatus on the basis of the input information from the console panel . More specifically it is configured in such a manner that when the kind of the frozen materials R is inputted by the depressing operations on the food kind key and the numeric keypad an output of the high frequency oscillator is done on the basis of the kind thus inputted and when the three dimensions of the frozen materials R is inputted by the depressing operations on the food dimension key and the numeric keypad the height level of the top electrode is done on the basis of the dimension thus inputted. The operating conditions set by the operating condition setting portion are outputted to the control signal output portion described below in the form of a command signal requesting to output a control signal.

For the operating condition setting by the operating condition setting portion the ROM has stored a food kind table in which the kinds of the frozen materials R and the three dimensions of the frozen materials R are correlated with a high frequency output from the high frequency oscillator and a time pitch of the carrying belt driven intermittently. The operating condition setting portion is configured to set an output value of the high frequency oscillator and a time pitch of the carrying belt driven intermittently on the basis of the input information from the operating information input key and the numeric keypad with reference to the food kind table .

Meanwhile input information from the numerical quantity key and the numeric keypad that is the numerical quantity of the frozen materials R subjected to the thawing processing is stored temporarily in the RAM until the thawing processing is completed for the input numerical quantity of frozen materials R. The numerical quantity is managed on the basis of a set numerical quantity stored in the RAM . In order to manage the numerical quantity a count sensor to detect a count of the frozen materials R to which the thawing processing has been applied is provided at the downstream end of the apparatus main body and an accumulated count storage portion is provided to the RAM so that each time the count sensor detects a frozen material R done with the thawing processing the detected count is added to the numerical quantity stored in the accumulated count storage portion .

The operating condition setting portion is configured to compare the count accumulated in the accumulated count storage portion with the set count each time the count sensor detects a frozen material R and when the accumulated count reaches the set count to output a command signal requesting to stop the thawing processing to the control signal output portion .

Also it is configured in such a manner that the operating conditions set by the operating condition setting portion are displayed on the LCD to enable the operator to confirm whether the operating conditions thus set are correct.

The control signal output portion outputs control signals to the high frequency oscillator the driving motor the first valve gear and the second valve gear according to the command signal from the operating condition setting portion so that operations of the high frequency thawing apparatus are controlled concretely through appropriate driving of the high frequency oscillator and the driving motor and appropriate valve operations of the first and second valve gears and .

The control signal output portion is configured to output a control signal requesting to output high frequency waves at an adequate output corresponding to the kind and the three dimensions of the frozen materials R according to the command signal from the operating condition setting portion to the high frequency oscillator and to output a control signal requesting to turn around the carrying belt intermittently at a specific time pitch in specific cycles corresponding to the kind and the three dimensions of the frozen materials R to the driving motor .

Further the control signal output portion is configured to output a control signal requesting to open and close the carry in port and the carry out port by the driving of the opening and closing air cylinders corresponding to the intermittent turning of the carrying belt to the first valve gear and to output a control signal requesting to move up and down the top electrode by the driving of the elevation air cylinders corresponding to the intermittent turning of the carrying belt to the second valve gear .

It is configured in such a manner that these various kinds of control signals from the control signal output portion are outputted in an associated manner. Hence when the operation of the high frequency thawing apparatus is started the carrying belt is suspended first and the carry in port and the carry out port are opened by the driving of the opening and closing air cylinders while the top electrode is set at an upper position. Three frozen materials R from the upstream process are arrayed side by side in the width direction at the upstream end of the carrying belt in this state and subsequently the three frozen materials R are carried into the first thawing space V through the carry in port with a turn at one pitch of the carrying belt by the driving of the driving motor . The top electrode is then set at a lower position at a specific height level according to the dimension of the frozen materials R by the driving of the elevation air cylinders while the carry in port and the carry out port are closed so that the three frozen materials R are sandwiched between the unit electrodes for the first top electrode group in the first top electrode group and the bottom electrode .

In this instance following three frozen materials R are placed on the upstream end of the carrying belt . High frequency power from the first oscillator is supplied to the first top electrode group in this state for a specific time and the thawing processing is executed on the first three frozen materials R in the first thawing space V with the application of the high frequency power. When the application of the high frequency power to the frozen materials R for the specific time is completed the carry in port and the carry out port are opened and at the same time the top electrode is moved up toward the upper position. The following three frozen materials R are carried into the first thawing space V by a turning at one pitch of the carrying belt in this state and the same operation as above is continuously performed. Accordingly the thawing processing on the three new frozen materials R is started and the thawing processing is applied to the first three frozen materials R within the first thawing space V at a position advanced by one pitch.

As such operations are performed repetitively frozen materials R three at a time are successively carried into the thawing space V of the apparatus main body correspondingly to an intermittent turning of the carrying belt . The frozen materials R carried into the thawing space V are then subjected to the thawing processing three times each over a specific time within the first thawing space V and after the curing processing is executed two times each over a specific time the thawing processing by high frequency application from the unit electrodes for the second top electrode group is executed six times each over a specific time within the second thawing space V. After the curing processing is continuously executed two times each over a specific time the thawing processing by high frequency application from the unit electrodes for the third top electrode is executed ten times each over a specific time within the third thawing space V. The frozen materials R are then carried out to the outside via the carry out port .

As described above in detail the high frequency thawing apparatus of this embodiment applies the thawing processing to the frozen materials R by means of dielectric heating by applying high frequency waves from the high frequency oscillator to the frozen materials R via the opposing electrodes while they are sandwiched between the top electrode and the bottom electrode which is a space between opposing electrodes in the shape of a flat plate. The high frequency thawing apparatus of this embodiment has plural sets of plate shaped opposing electrodes in the embodiment above three sets the first top electrode group and the bottom electrode the second top electrode group and the bottom electrode and the third top electrode group and the bottom electrode used sequentially to thaw the frozen materials R. The unit electrodes for the first top electrode group in the first top electrode group used firstly for the thawing are made to have a smaller area than the area of the surface of the frozen material R opposing the electrodes. The unit electrodes for the second top electrode group in the second top electrode group used secondly for the thawing are made to be larger than the area of the unit electrodes for the first top electrode group. The unit electrodes for the third top electrode group in the third top electrode group used thirdly for the thawing are made to be larger than the area of the unit electrodes for the second top electrode group.

According to the configuration described above by setting the unit electrodes unit electrodes for the first top electrode group used for the first top electrode group on the uppermost stream end to be smaller than the area of the frozen material R the top electrode is able to thaw only the inside of the frozen material R at the initial stage of the thawing processing because the crest edge portion of the frozen material R is not subjected to high frequency heating by avoiding transmission of energy of high frequency waves. It is thus possible to eliminate the inconvenience that the temperature distribution becomes inhomogeneous due to the overheating in the crest edge portion of the frozen material R at the initial stage of the thawing processing which results in poor thawing.

Because the top electrode in the second set and thereafter the unit electrodes for the second top electrode group and the unit electrodes for the third top electrode group are made to have areas that become larger stepwise than the area of the proceeding electrodes a ratio of the crest edge portion of the frozen material R covered by the electrodes increases each time the high frequency thawing processing is performed between the opposing electrodes and the crest edge portion is more readily heated step by step by the high frequency waves.

Hence by properly setting the number of sets of the opposing electrodes to be adopted and an increase of the opposing areas of the opposing electrodes to suit the situation it is possible to thaw the frozen material R in a uniform state having no noticeable variance in the thawing temperature at the respective portions.

An amount of energy of high frequency power supplied to the respective electrodes is made to be smaller stepwise from the first top electrode group to the second top electrode group and to the third top electrode group . Hence an amount of energy supplied to the frozen material R in response to a rise in temperature of the frozen material R is lessened with a progress of the thawed state. Hence not only is it possible to avoid an inconvenience that the temperature rises abruptly with a progress in the thawing processing but it is also possible to achieve more uniform thawing processing by letting the effect of the heat transmission function be exerted inside the frozen material R with a progress in the thawing processing.

In the embodiment described above the carrying belt stretched over the drive roller and the driven roller and carrying the frozen materials R by turning around is provided and it is configured in such a manner that the thawing processing is executed by applying high frequency waves to the frozen materials R while the frozen materials R are being carried on the carrying belt . This makes it possible to apply the thawing processing to the frozen materials R in series so that the thawing processing for the frozen materials R can be performed effectively on an industrial scale.

The high frequency oscillator having the same output is used in a plural form in the embodiment described above three oscillators the first through third oscillators and from upstream to downstream . The areas of the unit electrodes to which is applied high frequency power from the first through third oscillators and are increased toward the downstream end while the number of unit electrodes to which is applied high frequency power from one high frequency oscillator is increased according to the size thereof. An amount of energy applied to a single unit electrode is therefore reduced toward the downstream end. Hence by adopting plural high frequency oscillators having the same output it is possible to achieve an event that an amount of energy conferred to the frozen material R is lessened to prevent partial overheating with an increase of the opposing area. In comparison with a case where plural oscillators having different outputs are adopted the overall configuration including the operation control can be simpler which can in turn contribute to a reduction of the equipment costs.

It should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the embodiment described above and it is understood that the invention covers the following modifications.

 1 In the embodiment described above three oscillators the first through third oscillators and are adopted as the high frequency oscillator . The invention however is not limited to the configuration in which three high frequency oscillators are provided and less than three oscillators may be adopted as well depending on the situation or alternatively four or more oscillators may be adopted.

 2 In the embodiment described above the top electrode is divided into three parts the first through third top electrode groups and . The invention however is not limited to the configuration in which the top electrode is divided into three parts and the top electrode may be divided into two parts or four or more parts.

 3 In the embodiment described above the bottom electrode serving as the electrode on the ground side is made to have quite a large dimension. The invention however is not limited to the configuration in which the bottom electrode is made to have a large dimension. It may be configured in such a manner that the bottom electrode is made to have a smaller dimension than the frozen material R while the top electrode is made to have a larger dimension than the frozen material R. Alternatively both of the top electrode and the bottom electrode may be made to have smaller dimensions than the frozen material R.

 4 In the embodiment described above the thawing processing is executed by high frequency application while the frozen materials R are carried by a turning of the carrying belt . Instead of this configuration for example a method of loading the frozen material R in a space between the top electrode and the bottom electrode by an action of the robot arm may be adopted.

 5 In the embodiment described above high frequency power is applied to the frozen materials R successively from the unit electrodes for the first top electrode group the unit electrodes for the second top electrode group and the unit electrodes for the third top electrode group which are made to have areas that become larger stepwise while the frozen materials R are carried on the carrying belt . However instead of this configuration a frozen material stationary method may be adopted by which the frozen material R is placed on the bottom electrode so as to remain stationary and the smaller top electrode is replaced by the larger top electrode in order for the frozen material R in a stationary state.

As shown in the high frequency thawing apparatus of the first embodiment adopting the frozen material stationary method includes the first top electrode serving as a top electrode and exhibiting an almost elliptical shape the second top electrode exhibiting an annular shape and externally fit to the first top electrode while the inner peripheral edge surface thereof comes into sliding contact with the outer peripheral edge surface of the first top electrode and the third top electrode exhibiting an annular shape and externally fit to the second top electrode while the inner peripheral edge surface thereof comes into sliding contact with the outer peripheral edge surface of the second top electrode . The area of the inner side of the outer peripheral edge surface of the third top electrode is made to be slightly smaller than the area of the top surface of the frozen material R.

In addition a cylinder device to move up and down these first through third top electrodes and is provided. The cylinder device is formed of a first cylinder device for the first top electrode a second cylinder device for the second top electrode and a third cylinder device for the third top electrode .

In order to apply the thawing processing to the frozen material R as shown in the first top electrode is firstly moved down by the driving of the first cylinder device for the first top electrode to oppose the top surface of the frozen material R at a specific interval. In this state a first step of the thawing processing is executed by high frequency application via the first top electrode .

Subsequently when a specific time has passed in the first step of the thawing processing the second top electrode is moved down by the driving of the second cylinder device . Then as shown in the top surface of the frozen material R is brought into a state where it opposes the first top electrode and the second top electrode at a specific interval. In this state a second step of the thawing processing is executed by applying high frequency waves to the frozen material R via the first and second top electrodes and .

When the second step of the thawing processing over a specific time is completed the third top electrode is moved down lastly by the driving of the third cylinder device . The frozen material R is thus brought into a state where it opposes the first through third top electrodes and . In this state high frequency application over a specific time via the first through third top electrodes and which is a third step of the thawing processing is performed on the frozen material R.

According to the high frequency thawing apparatus of the first embodiment adopting the frozen material stationary method configured as above there is no need to move the frozen material R except when it is attached to and removed from the bottom electrode a contribution can be made to a reduction of the equipment costs.

As shown in a top electrode of opposing electrodes in the second embodiment adopts an electrode of a folding type. As shown in the top electrode is formed of the first top electrode exhibiting a rectangular shape and the second top electrode provided to be foldable on the respective side portions of the first top electrode .

The second top electrode is formed of a pair of first plate pieces connected to corresponding edge portions of the first top electrode via specific hinge members a pair of second plate pieces connected to the other opposing edge portions of the first top electrode via specific hinge members and a pair of third plate pieces connected to the opposing edge portions of the respective second plate pieces via specific hinge members.

The first through third plate pieces and are made to have dimensions so that when they are in a folded state they are accommodated on the first top electrode by overlapping one on another as shown in and when they are developed as shown in they form the top electrode of a rectangular shape that is larger than the first top electrode when viewed from above.

The elevation operation of the top electrode is performed by the driving of a cylinder device attached to the first top electrode at the center portion thereof.

According to the top electrode configured as above by folding the second top electrode the area of the top electrode in the first step of the thawing processing is as shown in the same as the area of the first top electrode . In the second step of the thawing processing by developing each of the first through third plate pieces and of the second top electrode the top electrode becomes larger than the first top electrode as shown in . It should be noted that the developing operation and the folding operation of the first through third plate pieces and are performed manually.

According to the top electrode configured as above because the structure is quite simple a further contribution can be made to a reduction of the equipment costs. In addition it is suitable for the thawing processing for a small scale.

In order to confirm the advantage of the high frequency thawing apparatus of the invention a block of frozen beef was adopted as a sample R of the frozen material R and a test Example of the thawing processing in three steps was conducted on the sample R. The size of the sample R was lengthwise dimension 530 mm crosswise dimension 360 mm thickness dimension 170 mm and the weight was about 25 kg. The measured temperature of the sample R was found to be at 18.5 C. to 19.5 C. about 19 C. in average in the surface layer portion 10 mm deep from the surface and 19 C. to 20 C. about 19.5 C. in average in the center portion 80 mm deep from the surface .

Initially in the first step of the thawing processing as shown in an electrode plate having the lengthwise dimension 370 mm crosswise dimension 250 mm was adopted. After the sample R was placed on an electrode plate larger than the plane dimension of the sample R the electrode plate was overlaid on the sample R at the center portion thereof and high frequency waves from the high frequency oscillator whose output was set to 100 W kg sample were applied for ten minutes. An amount of energy applied to the sample R was 1000 W min kg.

Subsequently in the second step of the thawing processing as shown in an electrode plate larger than the one used in the first step and having the lengthwise dimension 420 mm crosswise dimension 280 mm was adopted and after the sample R subjected to dielectric heating in the first step was placed on the electrode plate the same as the one used in the first step the electrode plate was overlaid on the sample R at the center portion thereof and high frequency waves from the high frequency oscillator whose output was set to 80 W kg sample were applied for 12 minutes. An amount of energy applied to the sample R was 960 w min kg.

In the final third step of the thawing processing as shown in an electrode plate larger than the one used in the second step and having the lengthwise dimension 480 mm crosswise dimension 320 mm was adopted. After the sample R subjected to dielectric heating in the second step was placed on the electrode plate the same as the one used in the first step the electrode plate was overlaid on the sample R at the center portion thereof and high frequency waves from the high frequency oscillator whose output was set to 60 W kg sample were applied for ten minutes. An amount of energy applied to the sample R was 600 W min kg.

As a result in the test of this example energy of 2560 W min kg in total was applied to the frozen beef used as the sample R in three steps.

Subsequently three comparative tests were conducted using samples R prepared under the same conditions as those of Example as comparative examples for comparison with Example.

Initially in Comparative Example 1 as shown in after the sample R was placed on the electrode plate the top surface thereof was covered with an electrode plate set to have the lengthwise dimension 1000 mm the crosswise dimension 800 mm which was significantly larger than the sample R and high frequency waves from the high frequency oscillator at an output of 50 W kg were applied to the sample R for 50 minutes via the electrode. An amount of energy applied to the sample R in Comparative Example 1 was 2500 W min kg.

Subsequently in Comparative Example 2 as shown in an electrode smaller than the sample Ri and made to have the lengthwise dimension 370 mm the crosswise dimension 250 mm an electrode having the same dimension as the one shown in was used as the electrode plate and high frequency waves from the high frequency oscillator whose output was set to 80 W kg were applied to the sample R the same as the one used in Comparative Example 1 for 30 minutes. An amount of energy applied to the sample R in Comparative Example 2 was 2400 W min kg.

In Comparative Example 3 conducted last the thawing processing was applied to the same sample R in two steps by using the electrode plate having the same size as the one used in Comparative Example 2 as shown in . Initially in the first step high frequency waves were applied for ten minutes at an output of 130 W kg and in the subsequent second step high frequency waves were applied for 12 minutes at an output of 80 W kg. An amount of energy applied to the sample R in Comparative Example 3 was 2260 W min kg.

The test conditions and the test results of these Example and Comparative Examples are set forth in Table 1 below. The temperature distribution temperature distribution measured immediately after the thawing processing ended of the sample R as the test result is set forth in . Incidentally is an explanatory view showing the temperature distribution of the sample R immediately after the thawing processing was completed in the form of numerical values. shows the temperature distribution of Example. shows the temperature distribution of Comparative Example 1. shows the temperature distribution of Comparative Example 2. shows the temperature distribution of Comparative Example 3. A subscript a written next to through indicates that the drawing shows the temperature distribution of the surface layer and a subscript b indicates that the drawings shows the temperature distribution of the center portion in the vertical direction.

As is set forth in Table 1 energy of nearly the same amount 2260 W min kg to 2560 W min kg was inputted to the samples R prepared under the same conditions in Example and Comparative Examples in Example the energy was the largest 2560 W min kg which is disadvantageous in terms of uniform heating . In Example the average temperature of the surface layer portion at a point in time when the thawing processing was completed is 3.6 C. and the variance 1 is 0.55 C. and the average temperature of the center portion is 4.2 C. and the variance 1 is 0.55 C. which is the same as that of the surface layer portion. It is therefore understood that the temperature distribution is uniform having an extremely small variance.

On the contrary in Comparative Example 1 the average temperature of the surface layer portion is 0.9 C. and the variance 1 is 7.80 C. and the average temperature of the center portion is 0.1 C. and the variance 1 is 10.52 C. Hence the temperature distribution is inhomogeneous having quite a large variance. In addition part of the crest edge portion on the surface layer of the sample R becomes as high as 5.5 C. to 31.8 C. see FIG. Ba and part of the center portion becomes as high as 43.7 C. see FIG. Bb . The reason is assumed to be that because the electrode plate was so large to lie off from the sample R energy concentrated on the crest edge portion of the sample R and gave rise to local overheating in these portions.

In Comparative Example 2 the average temperature of the surface layer portion is 4.5 C. and the variance 1 is 2.27 C. and the average temperature of the center portion is 5.9 C. and the variance 1 is 2.48 C. It is understood that overheating in the crest edge portion on the surface layer is suppressed by making the electrode plate smaller than the sample R rather the temperature becomes lower than in the center portion. The reason is assumed to be that input of energy to the crest edge portion was kept suppressed until the end.

Hence in Comparative Example 3 application of high frequency waves was divided into two steps and quite large energy at an output of 130 W kg was inputted to the sample R in the first step so as to rise the temperature of the crest edge portion. The average temperature of the surface layer portion is 3.7 C. and the variance 1 is 3.50 C. and the average temperature of the center portion is 6.2 C. and the variance 1 is 1.86 C. However because the size of the electrode was kept small during the application of high frequency waves in the second step the center portion is hotter see .

On the contrary in Example application of high frequency waves was divided into three steps and an output of the high frequency oscillator was reduced in each step while the size of the electrode plate was increased stepwise. It is therefore confirmed that the temperature of the crest edge portion of the sample R can be an appropriate temperature see FIG. Aa while achieving uniform heating to the sample R.

As has been described a high frequency thawing apparatus of the invention is a high frequency thawing apparatus that executes thawing processing by means of dielectric heating by applying high frequency power to a frozen material processed in a required thickness in a thawing section which is characterized in that the thawing section includes first opposing electrodes whose at least one of electrodes to sandwich the frozen material has a shape of a plate in a size smaller than a shape of a sandwiched surface of the frozen material second opposing electrodes whose at least one of electrodes to sandwich the frozen material has a shape of a plate in a size larger than the shape of the plate in the smaller size and a high frequency wave supply portion that supplies the frozen material with high frequency power via the second opposing electrodes after the high frequency power is supplied to the frozen material via the first opposing electrodes.

Also a high frequency thawing method of the invention is a high frequency thawing method for executing thawing processing by means of dielectric heating by applying high frequency power to a frozen material processed in a required thickness in a thawing section which is characterized in that the high frequency power is applied to a material to be thawed while being sandwiched between first opposing electrodes whose at least one electrode has a shape of a plate in a size smaller than a shape of a sandwiched surface of the frozen material and the high frequency power is continuously applied to the frozen material while being sandwiched between second opposing electrodes whose at least one electrode has a shape of a plate in a size larger than the shape of the plate in the smaller size.

The phrase a frozen material processed in a required thickness means a frozen material processed to have a required thickness dimension as the target value in a state where a variance with some degree is present during the manufacturing process of the frozen food. Hence even when irregularities and swelling or depression are present on the surface of a frozen material to some extent the frozen material is included in the range of a frozen material processed in a required thickness .

As described above the frozen material supplied to the thawing section is firstly subjected to the thawing processing by the first step of dielectric heating as high frequency power is supplied from the high frequency wave supply portion while the frozen material is sandwiched between the first opposing electrodes. Subsequently the frozen material is subjected to the thawing processing by the second step of dielectric heating by high frequency application while being sandwiched between the second opposing electrodes.

The processed frozen material is formed into a three dimensional shape having a required thickness such as a substantially square prism or a cylindrical column of a specific dimension size determined in advance. Regarding the first opposing electrodes to sandwich such a frozen material at least one of the electrodes is made to have a shape of a plate in a size smaller than the shape of the sandwiched surface of the frozen material. Hence at the initial stage of the thawing processing the crest edge portion of the frozen material is subjected to the thawing processing by high frequency heating at a lower level than in the other portions by avoiding concentration of energy of high frequency waves. It is thus possible to eliminate an inconvenience that the crest edge portion of the frozen material is overheated at the initial stage of the thawing processing and the thawing state becomes inhomogeneous.

Regarding the second opposing electrodes used in the second step of the thawing processing because at lest one of the electrodes has a shape of a plate in a size larger than the shape of the plate in the smaller size of the first opposing electrodes the crest edge portion of the frozen material is covered with the opposing electrodes almost completely or in a reliable manner. The crest edge portion of the frozen material that has not been thawed sufficiently by the first opposing electrodes is more readily heated than the other portions by this configuration combined with concentration of energy of high frequency waves. The frozen material can be therefore thawed uniformly in a state where there is no significant variance in the thawing temperature when the thawing processing by high frequency heating is completed.

Also it may be preferable that the high frequency wave supply portion is configured in such a manner that amounts of applied power to the first and second opposing electrodes are almost the same.

According to this configuration the frozen material is subjected to dielectric heating by the first and second opposing electrodes under the same high frequency application conditions which enables uniform thawing processing to be achieved. In addition the control and the management of the high frequency wave supply source can be simpler.

Also it may be preferable that the high frequency wave supply portion is configured in such a manner that a supplied power level to the second opposing electrodes is lower than a supplied power level to the first opposing electrodes.

According to this configuration as the thawing processing by the first opposing electrodes shifts to the thawing processing by the second opposing electrodes the level of the power supplied to the frozen material becomes lower with a progress in the thawed state. Hence not only is it possible to avoid an inconvenience that the temperature of the crest edge portion rises abruptly with a progress in the thawing processing but it is also possible to achieve more uniform thawing processing by letting the effect of the heat transmission function be exerted inside the frozen material according to a progress in the thawing processing.

Also it may be preferable that the thawing section includes a carrier mechanism that carries the frozen material from a sandwiching position of the first opposing electrodes to a sandwiching position of the second corresponding electrodes. According to this configuration the frozen material is automatically carried from the sandwiching position of the first opposing electrodes to the sandwiching position of the second corresponding electrodes.

Also it may be preferable that the thawing section is provided with a curing space defined between the first opposing electrodes and the second corresponding electrodes in which a supply of the high frequency power to the frozen material being carried by the carrier mechanism is suspended. According to this configuration the temperature can be made uniform through heat conduction inside the frozen material without the application of high frequency waves.

It should be noted that means for achieving any function described in the specification is not limited to the configuration to achieve such a function as descried in the specification and it is understood that the means includes a configuration such as a unit and a portion to achieve such a function.
