The present invention relates to the field of stereoscopy and more particularly to a method or a system which makes it possible to take action remotely in order to modify the properties of an object.

Stereoscopy is a process which makes it possible to reconstruct a relief sensation from the fusion of two flat images of the same subject. Stereoscopy thus makes possible a 3 dimensional representation from two sources of images. The use of stereoscopy is currently very widespread.

Stereoscopy plays a part in video games in order to show the gaming environment in which the user will play.

Stereoscopy is a very widely used tool in the field of mechanics relating to design reviews virtual fluid flows as well as simulation training.

In industry when a static modelling of a product is completed one of the first essential needs is to check the proper dynamic functioning. At this stage the perception of relief and virtual interaction are very important in order to view the product in all possible situations during its integration within a system which is waiting for this product for example.

Currently the simulations are carried out more and more by a manipulation of digital models which underlies an increased virtual modelling collision force feedback. The current user interfaces are not sufficiently ergonomic which thus brings about a not insignificant loss of time which is a substantial disadvantage.

In the medical field a large number of operations require video and use natural or non natural channels in order to intervene using instruments. These operations have a field of intervention which is viewed on a monitor. The instruments are interchangeable but always at the end of two intervention pliers.

Currently students train in such techniques with rare and costly means. For example they require animal supply facilities. In fact the training methods do not provide for simulation tools for such interventions. The training sessions are thus limited which is all the more disadvantageous for the students.

As a consequence an object of the present invention is to provide a system which makes it possible to carry out a precise three dimensional manipulation in a volume situated around the user accommodation distance on an object which is viewed in an apparatus adapted for this purpose. The manipulation space is a volume in spatial coherence with the viewing space.

Another advantage is that the manipulation space is free i.e. empty. Therefore the hands or the real and physical sensors actuators are not viewed on the viewing device. The representation of the hands is thus concealed.

In this device scale reduction is possible in order to adapt for example the manipulation of an object of a real space to the manipulation of an object of a virtual space.

An additional advantage is the large degree of precision of the resolution because the voxel density is greater than ten thousand voxels per cubic centimeter.

A support is provided under the device. An articulated arm is fixed at one of its ends to this support with the other end of the arm being directly fixed onto a site chosen by the user table desk etc . The fixing of this support thus takes place on the rear part of the device.

As depicted on this device is firstly made up of a base . This base is in the shape of a half disc . The straight side of the half disc is the front part of the base. The rounded side of the half disc is the rear part of the base. The rear and front part of the base meet forming a slight rectangular projection at their two ends.

In the middle of the rounded side of this half disc the edge of the surface follows a rounded shape which is oriented towards the inside of the half disc. Facing this rounded shape a more rectangular shape is carved out in the middle of the straight side of the half disc. On each side of this rectangular shape the straight side of the half disc has a slightly plump shape

On this half disc in there is located a central support . This central support is made up of two rectangular plates linked to one another along their lengths. Each width of these plates is fixed onto the base by means of screws. This central support is fixed to the centre of the half disc between the rounded shape and the rectangular shape . These plates together form an angle of approximately 45 . The angular opening of the plates is directed towards the rounded shape of the base . The plates of this central support each comprise a central mirror .

Two lateral supports are also situated on the half disc. These lateral supports are situated at the two ends of the base on each side of the central support . Each lateral support includes two parallelepipeds linked to one another by a z shaped structure. Each lateral support is oriented at approximately 45 from the straight side of the base towards the interior of this base. Each lateral support also includes a lateral mirror . This mirror possesses a reflective index ranging from 0 to 100 reflection. This lateral mirror can be replaced by a screen a filter or even lenses. The lateral mirror and the parallelepipeds are fixed onto the base by means of screws and slugs . At one of the ends of one of the lateral supports at the side of the end of the base two cinch connectors are arranged on a video panel .

In front of the lateral supports and the central support there is located the screen support of the screen . This screen support has a length which is equal to that of the straight part of the base. This screen support is fixed onto the front part of the base by means of screws . At one of its ends and at the side of the cinch connectors the screen support comprises a Bulgin type switch mounted on one interior plate by means of screws.

A volume piece following the contours of the base is arranged on the base so as to cover the central support the lateral supports and the screen support. This volume piece includes a band which constitutes the lateral surface of the volume piece. On the rear part of the device the band reproduces the cut out of the rounded form of the base. On the end of the band facing the cinch connectors the band has an empty space in order to allow the fitting of the cinch connectors of the lateral support . On the front part of the device the band reproduces the rectangular shape of the base. As shown in at a certain height from the base and vertically aligned with this rectangular cut out the band comprises a viewing window . This window is thus situated in a sort of recess which the band has on the front part of the device. In the viewing space behind this window the user can view a superposition of images coming from two differently combined sources as will be set out hereafter.

The volume piece also comprises a cover shown in . This cover is identical to the half disc following the base . A decoration plate is located on this cover .

During its use the device thus only allows the cover the outer face of the base and the band to appear. On the front part of the device the band comprises the viewing window which gives access to the viewing space . On the rear face of the band there is found the user s work space as we will set out hereafter.

As shown in the device is directly connected to a central electronic unit such as a computer. This computer includes different image processing software as well as graphic or electronic cards. This computer also includes peripherals such as for example a keyboard a mouse and a monitor . Furthermore this computer includes a peripheral for the use of the device this is one or several sensors actuators as shown in . This sensor actuator is made up of a support base connected to the computer . This base includes a slot in which there is arranged a pivoting element . This pivoting element has a length of some centimeters. It itself forms a single unit with an elongate element and has a length of approximately ten centimeters. This elongate element has an end in the form of an open forceps. This type of forceps holds the end of an element which resembles a pen. This is a stylet which has six degrees of freedom in the space. This stylet also laterally comprises a small curser as will be set out later. The user takes action by manipulating this stylet in the working zone. The element or stylet is also referred to as a sensor actuator in .

The image of this object is visible in the viewing space in an orthonormal manipulation space xm ym zm . In effect at least two video image capture systems and situated on either side of the object transmit by means of a video link the image of the real object directly to the viewing device on the first inputs . These image capture systems are for example video cameras magnetic resonance imaging systems or even scanners using lasers.

Following this first real object a second object for example a virtual object such as a coffee cup is considered. This object is situated in a virtual orthonormal space xv yv zv . The image of this object is visible in the viewing space in the same orthonormal handling space xm ym zm as previously. In effect at least two virtual cameras and situated on either side of the virtual object send the image of the virtual object to the computer . This computer processes the images so as to transmit them to the viewing device on the inputs via a link and application programming interfaces .

Depending on the inputs or which receive the images transmitted to the viewing device these images give rise to different optical processes in the viewing device.

These optical processes are described in for which all the symmetry of the different mirrors and the screens is not shown.

Thus the rear screen of the viewing device generates two extreme rays and which correspond to an image coming from the rear of the viewing device. By symmetry of the device this image is received by the right eye and the left eye of the user on the user s head . In the same way the front screen of the viewing device generates for example a middle ray which corresponds to an image coming from the front of the viewing device. By means of symmetry of the device this image is received by the right eye and by the left eye of the user.

At the rear of the viewing device in the work zone or manipulation zone as shown on the user can manipulate the sensors actuators using his her hands without the image of the hands appearing in the viewing space

Thus the viewing device makes it possible to view the superposition of two images these being real and virtual images. This is therefore a case of augmented virtual reality. The mode of operation haptic described in makes it possible to show the use of the sensors actuators and shown as element in and the consequence of this use on the objects viewed as images in the viewing space . These sensors actuators have a cursor which makes it possible to choose between a positioning action on the object in the viewed image and a movement action of the object on the viewed image.

The user can just as well control the actions of positioning or movement on the entire object or only on a part. Thus the user can turn an object orient it differently or exert a pressure on a certain zone of this object. This manipulation can be carried out just as well by means of a sensor as without the sensor. The user can for example directly use his her fingers and in this way carry out any type of manipulation. He she can also carry out these manipulations using a glove. During this manipulation the user views the two images real and virtual superposed in the viewing space.

Using the sensors actuators in the manipulation space the user acts for example on the real image and on the virtual image. This action is transmitted in the real space and virtual space after processing by the computer . In effect a first function of the computer carries out a time synchronisation between the images of the real space and those of the virtual space after the modifications carried out by the user on each object of each space. In each of these spaces there are found sensors actuators and situated on either side of the real or virtual object. Each of these sensors actuators is equipped with one processing unit . Thus the action transmitted in real space is received by the processing unit of the real sensors actuators and . These sensors actuators can for example be articulated arms of robots or even jacks. In the same manner the action transmitted in virtual space is received by the processing unit of the virtual sensors actuators and . The sensors actuators and are not viewable because they operate solely in a digital manner.

Thus the real and virtual sensors actuators will reproduce the movements induced by the user via the sensors actuators localised in the manipulation space behind the viewing device . As a consequence the actions generated by the user as a result of the manipulation of the sensors actuators in the manipulation space will be passed on to the object which is both real and virtual.

In our example the force feedback signal coming from the real sensor actuator is processed by the unit for processing the real actuators . Then the computer receives this signal and processes it. In fact a second function of the computer carries out a scaling between the images of real space and those of virtual space before the superposition of these two images in the viewing space

Then the images are transmitted to the processing unit of the virtual sensor actuator as well as the processing unit of the sensor actuator of the manipulation space.

The user can then experience the force feedback in the viewing space . The sensors actuators make it possible to give back the sense of touch.

This type of operation also applies if instead of considering a real object and a virtual object two virtual objects are considered this is a case of double virtual reality or a single virtual object this is a case of a stereoscopic screen or a single real object this is a case of autostereoscopic television
