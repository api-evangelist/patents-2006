The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the U.S. Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

The invention relates to containers for liquids such as water and more particularly to containers which are of rugged construction sufficient to survive air drops are flexible so as to be easily stored when empty inexpensive to manufacture and adapted for the interior thereof to be easily cleaned.

Current standard containers for soldiers in the field are plastic five gallon cans of relatively rigid construction. The current plastic cans typically do not survive air drops from 100 feet or more as by helicopters. Also being generally rigid in construction such containers when empty require essentially the same amount of storage space as when filled. Further such current containers are difficult to clean in the field inasmuch as access to the interior of the container is limited to the relatively small spout portion of the container. Still further the cost of current containers is about 42.00 per container even when mass produced.

There is thus a need for an improved container which remedies the above shortcomings of current containers in use.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide a container for water or other liquids which can survive a 100 foot drop without parachute without rupturing.

A further object is to provide such a container which is sufficiently flexible to be compressed when empty into a fraction of the space occupied by the container when full.

A further object is to provide such a container affording access to the interior thereof which can be easily cleaned.

A still further object of the invention is to provide such a container which is substantially less expensive to manufacture than the current containers.

With the above and other objects in view as will hereinafter appear a feature of the present invention is the provision of a flexible bag assembly for containment and dispersal of liquids. The bag assembly includes a bag having flexible front and back panels and a peripheral side panel structure interconnecting the front and back panels at sealed seams the panels defining a chamber for retaining the liquid. A water proof zipper is disposed in the front panel and a detachable cover member is fixable to an outside surface of the front panel and adapted to cover the zipper. A closeable and openable tube extends from within the chamber through one of the panels and outwardly therefrom the tube being adapted to facilitate the selective dispersal of the liquid from the bag.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular bag assembly embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that the improved container comprises a flexible bag assembly for containment and selective dispersal of liquid such as water.

The assembly includes a water proof and air tight bag having front and back panels and a peripheral side panel . The panels define a chamber internally thereof.

A water proof and air tight heavy duty zipper is disposed on the front panel . The zipper is mounted in a zipper panel fixed hermetically to the front panel by seams sealed with silicone on silicone adhesive.

The panels preferably are of a CORDURA fabric like material such as silicone treated CORDURA fabric or silicone fabric providing high strength and high abrasion resistance. CORDURA fabric is a high performance super durable nylon fabric which provides endurance and rugged durability for equipment exposed to extreme conditions and is resistant to punctures cuts tears and scuffs. The panels are joined together at sealed seams by heavy duty stitching preferably sealed with a silicone adhesive. In addition to being of high strength and highly abrasion resistance the material of the panels is inexpensive permanently mildew free and is sufficiently flexible to render the bag collapsible when empty.

The panels may be of unidirectional nylon woven material ranging from 500 to 1000 Denier that is of a mass of 500 1000 grams per 9000 meters of yarn which provides mildew resistance to water over a wide range of environments. The interior surfaces of the panels may also be provided with a thin film of anti microbial material for maintaining the freshness and quality of contained water.

A detachable cover member is fixable to an outside surface of the front panel and is sized and configured to cover the zipper . The cover member and the front panel outside surface may be provided with hermaphroditic fasteners such as VELCRO fastener for easily affixing the cover member to and detaching the cover member from the front panel . The zipper is covered to protect the zipper from damage during rough treatment such as upon impact after an extended free fall. The cover member is readily detachable to reveal the zipper for manual operation.

The bag may be provided with a strap for handling or carrying by person pack animal rope lines or the like. In addition the bag is provided with a fabric tab extending from the bag and provided with one or more grommets for receiving a supporting member not shown similar to a coat hook which extends through a grommet and holds the bag in an upright hanging position.

The bag is provided with a closeable and openable tube extending from the chamber through a panel and outwardly therefrom. The tube is adapted for selective dispersal of liquid from the bag. The tube may be sized and configured for acceptance by the spout of a one quart canteen or the like as desired.

When intended for replacing the current standard five gallon water can the bag is sized to contain five gallons of water and an air pocket so as to form a liquid surface within the bag adjacent the air pocket when the bag is hung by the tab . The zipper is disposed such that it can be opened from the top thereof downwardly thus to open a portion of the bag containing air. This allows air to enter the bag as liquid is drawn therefrom via the tube .

When the bag is substantially empty the flexible nature of the bag permits the bag to be compressed into a relatively small volume compared to its filled volume. The empty bag can be rolled or otherwise re shaped to fit into other containers.

Further by fully opening the zipper with the cover removed therefrom the bag may be pulled through the fully opened zipper to reverse the bag such that the inside becomes the outside of the bag and can be cleaned for further use.

In use in the field the bag herein described can be hauled manually or by pack animal or vehicle or helicopter or the like to the desired area. In the case of helicopter delivery the helicopter need not land but can drop the bags from over hundred foot altitudes and continue out of a hostile zone. After use empty bags can be rolled and or compressed and sent for refill with large numbers of bags requiring relatively little space compared to current plastic cans .

A still further advantage realized by the new containers is the option of autoclaving the bag and its contents without fear of damaging the bag. The bag can be autoclaved to 250 F. which is not an option with the current plastic can. Thus if clean drinking water is not available any water that is available can be autoclaved at 250 F. to increase the safety of human consumption thereof.

There is thus provided a new container for liquids the container providing many advantages not available in the current water container in general use in the military.

It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular construction herein disclosed and or shown in the drawings but also comprises any modification or equivalent within the scope of the claims.
