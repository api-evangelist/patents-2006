title: Thermal barrier fabric
abstract: A thermal barrier fabric includes an inner impermeable material layer, an outer impermeable material layer, a spacer material disposed between the inner and outer impermeable material layers, and a reflective layer of material disposed between the spacer and a selected one of the inner impermeable material layer and the outer impermeable material layer. The inner and outer impermeable material layers are bound to each other along portions thereof outboard of the spacer material and the reflective layer of material to define a closed compartment. The compartment is under a vacuum, such that the reflective layer of the fabric reflects thermal energy back toward the source thereof and the vacuum substantially prevents thermal energy transfer through the compartment.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the U.S. Government for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

The invention relates to fabric for use as a thermal barrier as in protective clothing and is directed more particularly to fabric for garments for conserving body heat of a wearer exposed to a cold environment such as frigid air or water or for protecting a wearer against exposure to severe heat or cold and for use in other enclosures requiring thermal obstruction.

It is known to provide garments for the protection of wearers against elements which can be injurious to the wearer s well being. One approach is to use materials which are of a thickness providing protection to the wearer against cold air. Such garments typically are extremely bulky and heavy. While providing protection from the elements such garments are difficult to work in because of the bulkiness of the garment.

Another approach is to provide garments having heating or cooling elements therein. Garments of this type require an outside source of heating or cooling medium or electrical power if electrical heating elements are utilized.

Neither of the above approaches is suitable for cold water exposure. In such instances wet suits of neoprene or the like are generally worn and serve simply to keep water away from contact with the skin of the wearer.

There is thus a need for a light weight relatively non bulky fabric from which garments can be made for protection of wearers against cold air and cold water and from which thermally protective enclosures can be made for protection of people and or goods.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide a light weight non bulky material for thermally protective garments.

A further object of the invention is to provide such a material as requires no outside medium introduced thereinto to provide protection against the elements.

A still further object of the invention is to provide such garment material as is sufficiently thin to be worn in water without unduly restricting the freedom of movement of the wearer.

A still further object is to provide such a material for other enclosures such as bags pouches boxes and the like for thermally shielding the contents thereof.

With the above and other objects in view a feature of the present invention is the provision of a garment fabric for conservation of body heat of a wearer the fabric comprising an inner impermeable material layer an outer impermeable material layer a spacer material disposed between the inner and outer impermeable material layers and a reflective foil layer of material disposed between the spacer and a selected one of the inner impermeable material layer and the outer impermeable material layer. The inner and outer impermeable material layers are bound to each other along portions thereof outboard of the spacer material and the reflective foil layer of material to define a closed compartment which is under a vacuum. The foil of the garment fabric reflects body heat back toward a wearer of the garment and the vacuum substantially prevents heat transfer by reduction of heat conduction and convection through the compartment.

In accordance with a further feature of the invention there is provided a heat barrier material for conservation of body heat of a wearer the barrier comprising an inner impermeable material layer an outer impermeable material layer a spacer material disposed between the inner and outer impermeable material layers and a reflective layer of material disposed between the spacer and a selected one of the inner impermeable material layer and the outer impermeable material layer the inner and outer impermeable material layers being bound to each other along portions thereof outboard of the spacer material and the reflective layer of material to define a closed compartment. The compartment is adapted to be under a vacuum. The reflective layer of material reflects body heat back toward a wearer of the barrier material and the vacuum substantially prevents heat transfer through the compartment.

In accordance with a still further feature of the invention there is provided a fabric for obstructing flow of heat therethrough toward a wearer of the fabric the fabric comprising an inner impermeable material layer an outer impermeable layer of non melting material a spacer material disposed between the inner and outer impermeable material layers and a reflective layer of material disposed between the spacer and a selected one of the inner impermeable material layer and the outer impermeable material layer the inner and outer impermeable material layers being bound to each other along portions thereof outboard of the spacer material and the reflective layer of material to define a closed compartment. The compartment is adapted to be under a vacuum. The reflective layer of material reflects heat back toward a source of heat and the vacuum substantially reduces heat transfer through the compartment toward the wearer.

In accordance with a still further feature of the invention there is provided a thermal barrier fabric for enclosures the fabric being adapted to provide thermal shielding of contents of an enclosure the fabric comprising an inner impermeable material layer an outer impermeable material layer a spacer material disposed between the inner and outer impermeable material layer and a reflective layer of material disposed between the spacer and a selected one of the inner impermeable material layer and the outer impermeable material layers the inner and outer impermeable material layers being bound to each other along portions thereof outboard of the spacer material and the reflective layer of material to define a closed compartment wherein the compartment is adapted to be under a vacuum whereby the reflective layer of material reflects thermal energy back toward a source thereof and the vacuum substantially prevents thermal energy transfer through the compartment.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular garment material embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to the drawings it will be seen that an illustrative fabric for conservation of body heat of a wearer includes an inner impermeable material layer and an outer impermeable material layer . The inner and outer material layers are preferably of a polymer material a fusible silicon or other impermeable material coated with an adhesive in the areas in which the inner and outer material layers are joined to each other. Alternatively the inner and outer layers may be of a woven knit or non woven cloth material coated with a polymer material or a fusible silicone to render the inner and outer layers impermeable.

The inner and outer layers are bound to each other in a stitchless manner in the areas as by fusion heat sealing ultrasonic sealing laser sealing adhesive sealing or the like. The cloth inner and outer layers are preferred for non water environments.

Adjacent at least one of the impermeable material layers and preferably though not necessarily adjacent each of the impermeable material layers is a reflective foil layer . The foil layer or layers are of reflective material such as mylar metal foil or the like.

Between the two reflective foil layers or if only one reflective layer is used between that layer and the opposed impermeable layer there is formed a compartment in which there is disposed a layer of spacer material . The spacer material is of greater thickness than all of the other layers combined. The spacer material may be of a mesh or foam construction so as to be low in weight and very flexible but of sufficient strength to resist compression and to maintain integrity of the compartment by separation of the reflective foil layers forming the compartment housing the spacer layer .

Thus the spacer and reflective foil layer or layers are retained in abutting relationship but are not otherwise bound to each other.

The thickness of the entire assembly of layers depends principally upon the thickness of the selected spacer the remaining layers all being of thicknesses which are so slight about 0.001 0.003 inch as to not affect weight and flexibility in an appreciable manner. The spacer layer preferably is about 0.25 or greater inch in thickness and because of its mesh structure defines a mostly void volume. For use in water the thinner spacer thickness 0.25 inch is preferred.

The compartment may be provided with a valve for the selective drawing of a vacuum in the compartment or terminating the vacuum in the compartment. The valve prevents surrounding air from entering the compartment the valve separating the internal vacuum from surrounding environment air pressure.

In operation body heat passing through the inner layer encounters the foil layer which reflects heat back to the wearer. Heat not reflected by the foil layer proceeds into the compartment which is under vacuum and which greatly reduces or stops escape by conduction and or convection of body heat. Any body heat getting through the vacuum encounters the foil layer which reflects the heat back toward the wearer s body. However the inwardly reflected heat is unable to move through the vacuum and past the reflective layer and therefore substantially remains in the compartment .

In an alternative embodiment the garment material described hereinabove may be used for obstructing heat flow therethrough and providing protection against extreme heat sources such as blast furnaces fires and the like by providing a layer of a non melting fiber material in place of the outer material layer . The non melting fiber material may be of Kevlar or Nomex or similar material.

There is thus provided a fabric for use in protective garments the fabric being of light weight and non bulky material and effective to prevent flow of heat therethrough.

While the fabric presented herein is discussed above with respect to protective clothing it will be apparent that the same construction applies to heat barrier materials for use in containers for hot or cold foodstuffs sleeping bags sleeping bag mats headwear footwear soles and other containers or enclosures containing matter or contents requiring shielding from thermal elements.

It is to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular construction herein disclosed and or shown in the drawings but also comprises any modification or equivalent within the scope of the claims.
