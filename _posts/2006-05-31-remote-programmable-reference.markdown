Conventional calibration systems such as a geolocation calibration system utilize reference sources that are fixed in schedule and purpose and which are tailored only for a particular system platform. As such one reference source can not readily be used for more than one system platform. For each geolocation system platform for example a unique and dedicated geolocation reference unit has to be designed for the specific hardware configuration and deployment differences of a particular system. These differences can result from different hardware implementations and as a result of replaced components cabling and environmental effects such as temperature altitude and the like.

The differences in the system platforms require a different approach to each application as well as the time and effort to create a unique solution for each application. In addition each system platform requires personnel with particular expertise to deploy a solution for use and sometimes to remote locations. Typically hands on setup and manual operation is required. Current solutions for calibration systems such as a geolocation system are costly require long lead times to deploy have limited versatility and are not reconfigurable.

This summary introduces simplified features and concepts of remote programmable reference which are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended for use in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In an embodiment of remote programmable reference a remote programmable reference system such as a remote programmable geolocation reference system can maintain a set of parameters and waveforms from which a reference signal can be generated to transmit the reference signal to a system platform such as a geolocation platform. A parameters and or waveforms update can be received from which a modified reference signal can be generated to transmit the modified reference signal.

In another embodiment of remote programmable reference the remote programmable reference system can maintain multiple sets of parameters and or waveforms from which respective reference signals can be generated for any one or more system platforms having different system configurations. The system platforms can each interface with the remote programmable reference system through a system interface via a communication network.

In another embodiment of remote programmable reference a system platform can communicate an input for a calibration reference signal to a remote programmable reference system that generates and transmits the calibration reference signal. The system platform can then receive the calibration reference signal from the remote programmable reference system to calibrate the system platform. The input can be communicated to the remote programmable reference system as a request to initiate that the remote programmable reference system generate and transmit the calibration reference signal or the input can be communicated as a set of programmable parameters from which the calibration reference signal can be generated.

Remote programmable reference methods and systems are described in which embodiments provide a flexible integrated solution for system calibration such as for geolocation system calibration. A network centric programmable system can provide for remote network operation software programmable waveforms integral RF power generation environment exclusions bands self calibration a flexible user interface and modular expandability of the system. The software programmable waveforms can be configurable and adaptable for any number of different system platforms that may have different hardware configurations and or characteristics that change based on equipment and environmental factors.

While features and concepts of the described systems and methods for remote programmable reference can be implemented in any number of different environments systems and or configurations embodiments of remote programmable reference are described in the context of the following exemplary environment and system architectures.

The remote geolocation reference system functions to generate reference signals also beacons that are transmitted at a specific time duration and power level as a reference signal requested or scheduled by a user to calibrate out system delays propagation effects and other transmission distortions that may impact system accuracy. The specific waveform characteristics frequencies transmission durations and scheduled transmission start times are downloaded over the network interface to the remote programmable reference system and entered into a scheduling queue.

Any regional constraints with respect to frequency band exclusions signal levels and or transmission durations can also be downloaded or preprogrammed. Multiple tasks e.g. the generation and transmission of reference signals can be scheduled based on priority assignments and with respect to designated schedule conflict resolutions such that multiple users can access and schedule the generation and transmission of a reference signal. A security access system with various security credential requirements can also be implemented to control system access and use. Additionally a removable memory component can be utilized to further implement security constraints.

A platform N can be any type of satellite or overhead system a ground based station an aircraft a ship or other watercraft or any other type of mobile or stationary platform that receives reference signal s from the remote programmable reference system . Any of the various platforms N can utilize a reference signal for target identification and tracking coastal perimeter and mainland border security collision detection and warning and for other implementations. In addition the remote programmable reference system can be implemented as a stationary mobile and or as a portable network centric programmable reference system to generate the reference signal s .

The communication network can be implemented as any one or combination of a wide area network e.g. the Internet a local area network LAN an intranet an IP based network broadcast network a public telephone network a wireless network or other type of network. Additionally communication network can be implemented using any type of network topology and any network communication protocol and can be represented or otherwise implemented as a combination of two or more networks.

In this example the remote programmable reference system includes a controller memory component s waveform generation component s RF frequency conversion components and an antenna system . The controller includes one or more processor s as well as an operating system and a calibration system which can each be implemented as computer executable instructions and executed by the processor s to implement embodiments of remote programmable reference. The calibration system can be implemented to measure the internal characteristics of the remote programmable reference system to evaluate system performance. The main memory component s maintain sets of reference signal parameters and or parameter updates a reference signal transmission schedule local RF environment constraints and limits and programmable waveforms .

The waveform generation components can include the memory or a portion thereof as high speed memory that maintains the programmable waveforms to be transmitted and can include a digital to analog converter that interfaces with the RF frequency conversion components to provide a modulated signal output to the antenna components . In an embodiment the remote programmable reference system may be implemented with any number and combination of differing components as further described below with reference to the exemplary remote programmable geolocation reference system shown in .

The controller of the remote programmable reference system can process multiple sets of reference signal parameters also programmable parameters to generate respective reference signals at scheduled transmission start times according to the transmission schedule . The reference signal parameters can include any one or combination of software programmable waveforms a transmission start time for a reference signal a transmission duration of a reference signal a reference signal power level a reference signal frequency an antenna band designation an exclusion band designation such as radio television and or cell phone bands and or geographic location information such as GPS information . A reference signal can also include position velocity and acceleration information pertaining to a mobile or portable remote programmable reference system that for example is implemented in an aircraft.

Any of the system platforms N can communicate system inputs through the system interface and via the communication network to the remote programmable reference system although only system platform N is illustrated as such . Although the system interface is shown as an independent component each of the system platforms N can implement a system interface to the remote programmable reference system via communication network . A system platform can communicate a set of reference signal parameters and or a parameter update to the remote programmable reference system or can communicate an input to the controller to initiate processing a set of the reference signal parameters to generate a reference signal that is transmitted to a system platform via the antenna system .

For example the controller can process a set of the reference signal parameters to generate a reference signal for transmission to the system platform at a designated time according to the transmission schedule . The remote programmable reference system can then receive a parameters update from the system platform via the system interface to modify the reference signal. Additionally the remote programmable reference system can receive another input from the system platform to initiate that the controller process the parameters update to generate a modified reference signal that is also transmitted to the system platform .

The remote programmable reference system can be implemented as a software firmware and or hardware system that is a flexible integrated solution for system calibration such as for geolocation system calibration. The system can provide for remote network operation software programmable waveforms integral RF power generation environment exclusions bands self calibration a flexible user interface and modular expandability of the system. The software programmable waveforms such as may be defined by the sets of reference signal parameters can provide that the remote programmable reference system is configurable and adaptable for any number of different system platforms N that may have different hardware configurations and or characteristics that change based on equipment and environmental factors. A reference signal generated by the remote programmable reference system may take into account the errors and or deviations that the effects of the many temperature climate and operational factors may have on the precise time and geographic location information derived from a reference signal.

The remote programmable reference system in environment may provide several advantages for a calibration system such as programmable waveform generation local storage of the programmable waveforms e.g. the reference signal parameters and time scheduled transmissions of the reference signals a network interface for scheduling system status monitoring and waveform loading network centric activity report messages scheduling messages and status capability reporting arbitrary waveform signaling from the stored programmable waveforms or via downloaded files and instructions timing based on local GPS Global Positioning System components including precision frequency reference and coordinates high and low band antenna provisions to select antennas based on frequency ranges programmable frequency constraints to exclude frequencies based on location such as around airports or other frequency sensitive locations programmable reference signal transmission power integral system monitoring of transmitter temperature antenna VSWR voltage standing wave ratio and transmit power levels broadband power level compensation to compensate for power level gain and propagation losses over wide band frequency emissions pre scheduled transmission capability with a transmit now provision when receiving an input from a system platform N and modularity to implement an expansion of frequency coverage as needed.

The controller of the remote programmable reference system can process multiple sets of reference signal parameters also programmable parameters to generate respective reference signals at scheduled transmission start times according to the transmission schedule . The reference signal parameters can include any one or combination of software programmable waveforms a transmission start time for a reference signal a transmission duration of a reference signal a reference signal power level a reference signal frequency an antenna band designation an exclusion band designation such as radio television and or cell phone bands and or geographic location information such as GPS information . A reference signal can also include position velocity and acceleration information pertaining to a mobile or portable remote programmable reference system that for example is implemented in an aircraft.

Methods for remote programmable reference such as exemplary methods and described with reference to respective and may be described in the general context of computer executable instructions. Generally computer executable instructions can include applications routines programs objects components data structures procedures modules functions and the like that perform particular functions or implement particular abstract data types. The methods may also be practiced in a distributed computing environment where functions are performed by remote processing devices that are linked through a communications network. In a distributed computing environment computer executable instructions may be located in both local and remote computer storage media including memory storage devices.

At block a unique waveform is defined according to requirements of a system application and a reference of the waveform is generated. For example the unique waveform can be developed as a simple unmodulated carrier waveform as a pseudo random sequence encoded waveform and the like. At block the waveform reference is communicated or downloaded to the remote programmable reference system.

At block multiple sets of reference signal parameters are maintained to generate different reference signals where each set of parameters corresponds to a different programmable reference signal. For example memory of the remote programmable reference system maintains a set of reference signal parameters from which a reference signal can be generated. In an embodiment the set of parameters are programmable and include any one or combination of a programmable waveform a reference signal transmission start time a reference signal transmission duration a reference signal power Level a reference signal frequency an antenna band designation an exclusion band designation and or geographic location information such as from GPS.

At block a transmission start time is scheduled for each of the different reference signals. For example the transmission schedule in the remote programmable reference system includes scheduled times for the controller to initiate generating each of the reference signals from the respective sets of reference signal parameters .

At block an input is received to initiate generation and transmission of a reference signal. For example controller of the remote programmable reference system receives an input such that the controller initiates generating a reference signal for transmission. In an embodiment the input to initiate the reference signal is a scheduled transmission start time such as maintained in transmission schedule at the remote programmable reference system . In another embodiment a system platform communicates an input through the system interface via the communication network to the remote programmable reference system to initiate the controller generating a reference signal for transmission back to the requesting system platform .

In yet another embodiment a system platform can communicate a reference signal request directly to the remote programmable reference system to request transmission of a reference signal. In an implementation of remote programmable reference an airport may implement the remote programmable reference system that can transmit upon request or as scheduled a custom calibration reference signal to each requesting aircraft e.g. system platform to calibrate the voice video radar and data receivers of an aircraft.

At block the reference signal is generated from a set of parameters to transmit the reference signal and an associated waveform. For example the controller of the remote programmable reference system initiates generating the reference signal from a stored waveform for transmission via the antenna assembly to the system platform . The reference signal can be generated according to the transmission schedule in an event that the input to initiate generating the reference signal is a schedule transmission start time input.

At block a parameters update is received to modify the reference signal. For example the controller of the remote programmable reference system receives a parameters update which is maintained by memory at the remote programmable reference system . In an embodiment the parameters update is received from system platform to modify the reference signal . In another embodiment the parameters update is received from system platform N that has a different system configuration than system platform . A system platform communicates the parameters update through the system interface via the communication network to the remote programmable reference system to be stored in memory .

At block an additional input is received to initiate generation and transmission of a modified or different reference signal. For example controller of the remote programmable reference system receives an input such that the controller initiates generating the modified or different reference signal for transmission. In an embodiment system platform communicates an additional input through the system interface via the communication network to initiate the controller generating the modified reference signal for transmission such that the system platform receives both the reference signal and the modified reference signal . In another embodiment system platform N communicates an input through the system interface via the communication network to initiate the controller generating the different reference signal for transmission where the system platform N has a different system configuration than system platform .

At block the modified or different reference signal is generated from the parameters update or from a different set of parameters to transmit the modified or different reference signal. For example the controller of the remote programmable reference system initiates generating the reference signal for transmission via the antenna assembly to the system platform or alternatively initiates generating the different reference signal for transmission via the antenna assembly to the system platform N .

At block initial system parameters are verified for operation and at block a GPS lock is established to stabilize the system. For example parameters of the remote programmable reference system are verified for operation and the system is stabilized and or coordinated with a GPS signal. Alternatively the remote programmable reference system can include a locked time reference for use in an event that the GPS signal is lost or cannot be acquired.

At block a determination is made as to whether a request to transmit or schedule a reference signal is received. For example a system platform can communicate a request or input through the system interface via the communication network to the remote programmable reference system to schedule a reference signal or to initiate the controller generating a reference signal for transmission.

If a request is received i.e. yes from block then the reference signal parameters of the request are validated at block . At block a transmission time is scheduled for the reference signal. For example the remote programmable reference system maintains a transmission schedule to generate and transmit the reference signals .

If a request is not received i.e. no from block or continuing from block then a determination is made as to whether there are pending tasks at block . If there are no pending or scheduled tasks i.e. no from block then the method continues at block waiting to receive a request. If there is a pending or scheduled task i.e. yes from block then generation of a reference signal from a set of parameters is initiated at block . For example the controller initiates generation of a reference signal from a set of reference signal parameters .

At block an antenna is selected to transmit the reference signal and at block a GPS timing mark is established. At block the reference signal is transmitted. For example the remote programmable reference system transmits the reference signal to a system platform via an antenna of the antenna system . At block data corresponding to the transmission is logged to maintain a record of the transmission.

At block an input for a calibration reference signal is communicated to a remote programmable reference system that generates and transmits the calibration reference signal. For example a system platform communicates an input to the remote programmable reference system . The system platform can communicate an input to the remote programmable reference system via the communication network through the system interface . The input can be communicated to the remote programmable reference system to initiate that the remote programmable reference system generate and transmit the calibration reference signal and or the input can be communicated as a set of programmable parameters from which the calibration reference signal is generated. The calibration reference signal can also be generated at a scheduled time for transmission of the calibration reference signal as an alternative to generating the calibration reference signal in response to receiving a request from a system platform.

At block a request is communicated to initiate that the remote programmable reference system generate and transmit the calibration reference signal from the set of programmable parameters. At block the calibration reference signal is received from the remote programmable reference system to calibrate the system platform. For example the system platform receives a calibration reference signal from the remote programmable reference system to calibrate the system platform .

At block an additional set of programmable parameters for a modified calibration reference signal is communicated to the remote programmable reference system. For example the system platform can communicate an additional set of programmable parameters to the remote programmable reference system from which a different or modified calibration reference signal is generated.

At block an additional request is communicated to initiate that the remote programmable reference system generate and transmit the different or modified calibration reference signal from the additional set of programmable parameters. At block the different or modified calibration reference signal is received from the remote programmable reference system to calibrate the system platform. For example the system platform receives a different or modified calibration reference signal from the remote programmable reference system to calibrate the system platform .
