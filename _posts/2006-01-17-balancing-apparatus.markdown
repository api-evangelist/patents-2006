This invention was made under Contract No. N00024 02 C 6324. The United States Government has rights in this invention under the contract.

This invention relates to apparatus for balancing loads and positioning the loads in a desired orientation.

When a component of a device is to be inserted into or mounted on the device it is important to position the component in a desired orientation for easy assembly. For example a Rapid Airborne Mine Clearance System RAMICS is a helicopter borne weapon system that will fire projectiles from a modified Gatling gun controlled by a blue green Light Detection and Ranging LIDAR sensor. The LIDAR locates and targets the mine and provides aiming coordinates to the gun s fire control system. Rounds are fired at the mine in bursts resulting in neutralization.

The RAMICS includes a closed vessel in the form of a cylindrical pod that contains the LIDAR sensor. In order to ensure personnel safety and prevent damage to the sensor when assembling the LIDAR sensor assembly into a RAMICS pod the sensor assembly must be properly oriented to slide into the pod.

Various conditions might cause a departure from the static center of gravity c.g. of the sensor assembly. These conditions include but are not limited to 1 components not installed in the LIDAR assembly due to availability 2 an uneven distribution of coolant in the mated units and 3 coolant and or interconnect cables added to the mated assembly prior to installation in order to ease integration. Because of the potential variability in the load balance of the sensor assembly a fixed pick point apparatus is impractical.

There is a need for an adjustable balancing apparatus that can be used to orient a load such as a sensor assembly for assembly into a device.

This invention provides an apparatus comprising a frame a counterweight connected to the frame a load attachment member connected to the frame a movable pick point mounted on the frame and a pick point position adjuster for moving the pick point to balance a load supported by the load attachment member.

This invention provides an adjustable balancing apparatus that can be used to orient the sensor assembly for assembly into the pod. The balancing apparatus allows for attachment to standard ground handling equipment. While shows the use of the invention to balance a sensor assembly it should be apparent that the invention could be used to balance other devices. As used in this description a load is a device that can be attached to the invention and the invention is used to balance the load.

The band clamp includes a bolt for tightening the band and is connected to the frame near the bottom of the frame. The band clamp is secured to the frame by a load attach pin . The band clamp is allowed to pivot so that the band does not bind when lifting the load.

The pick point includes a lifting lug connected to a translating nut by a swivel connection . The translating nut includes a threaded bore that has threads matching the threads of the screw such that rotation of the screw causes linear motion of the pick point. Once the desired amount of linear motion has been achieved the translation securing nut can be tightened against the translating nut to prevent further movement of the pick point. The pick pin can be positioned directly above the load attach pin or on either side of a vertical line passing through the load attach pin. The nominal location of the translating nut for the known static center of gravity is directly over the pick pin.

Load stabilizers and are positioned on opposite sides of the band attachment point. Because the band clamp is allowed to rotate any departure of the combined center of gravity of the load will cause the load to want to rotate in order to achieve equilibrium. The load stabilizers are adjusted down one side or the other until they contact the load prior to lifting. The load stabilizers prevent the load from rotating and allow the apparatus and load to be adjusted as a single unit.

In the band is shown in a detached position below the frame. The band includes a block having an opening . When the band is attached to the frame the pin extends through the opening . Block acts as a spacer to take out any free play between the band and the frame.

The counterweight includes a plurality of plates attached to the frame. The number or weight of the plates can be changed to adjust the total weight of the counterweight.

In one embodiment the balancing apparatus is approximately 2 ft 6 in 4 in 60.9 cm 15.2 cm 10.2 cm wide weighs approximately 22 lbs. 10 kg and has a hand wheel to allow for easy adjustment of unbalanced loads. The balancing apparatus can be constructed using an aluminum frame with steel counterweight plates. The balancing apparatus can include a band clamp assembly attached to the main translating unit via a quick disconnect pin . The translation securing nut is provided to secure the translating nut prior to mating procedures.

In the embodiment shown in the figures the attachment member is a band that can be easily fitted on a cylindrical portion of a sensor assembly. It should be recognized that different attachment members could be used to accommodate different loads. Any cantilevered load of known but variable c.g. could potentially take advantage of this design.

While the invention has been described in terms of an embodiment that is used to position a sensor assembly it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes can be made to the described embodiment and the balancing apparatus can be used with various types of loads without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.
