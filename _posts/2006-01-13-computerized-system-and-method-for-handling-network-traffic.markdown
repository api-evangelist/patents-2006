title: Computerized system and method for handling network traffic
abstract: A computerized system and method for processing network content associated with multiple virtual domains. The processing may include anti-malware scanning and/or content filtering. The content associated with multiple domains may be processed in the same daemon process. In response to connection requests from virtual domains, the service process creates separate sockets to communicate with each virtual domain. A global configuration management module is used to provide configuration parameters for each session to the service process. A logging manager processes both the global logs and the logs from each virtual domain. Alternatively, the service process may initiate other service processes to handle incoming connections from one or more virtual domains, in order to better utilize resources in a multiple-CPU environment. Different service processes may be used to handle various aspects of content processes, for example one process may handle anti-malware scanning, while another process may handle content filtering.

The present invention generally relates to computer networking and more specifically to achieving security and or scalability in networking systems.

Security threats have evolved dramatically over the last 10 years moving from network level connection oriented attacks to application level agent based attacks. Conventional networking devices firewalls can deal with network level packet processing for example conventional firewalls can stop packets that do not come from a valid source and VPN gateways can encrypt packets on the fly making it safe for them to traverse the Internet. But today s critical network threats like malware which includes spyware viruses and worms are embedded in the application level contents of packet streams. Enormous processing power is needed to detect and stop these application layer threats by extracting the content from multiple packets reconstructing the original content and scanning it for the telltale signs of attacks or for inappropriate content.

To address these security challenges modern firewalls must offer application level content processing in real time especially for real time applications like Web browsing at today s and tomorrow s increasing network speeds.

In a firewall processing of network traffic is determined by a set of specific rules which collectively form a firewall policy. The firewall policy dictates how the firewall should handle specific applications network traffic such as web email or telnet. Exemplary rules include filtering of banned words blocking specific URLs blocking transmission of specific file types anti malware scans blocking of spam etc. Each firewall policy generally has an associated firewall configuration profile which configures the firewall to process the network content. The firewall policy is usually created by the network administrator and is based on the information security policy of the respective organization.

A firewall is typically implemented as a hardware software appliance having a number of physical networking interfaces for the incoming and outgoing network traffic. Network traffic enters one of these interfaces and after filtering and other appropriate processing is routed to a remote host typically attached to a different physical interface. In some circumstances firewalls are configured to also have logical interfaces such as Virtual Local Area Network VLAN or Point To Point Protocol PPP interfaces. Such logical interfaces are purely software implemented and do not map directly to a physical interface. For example in VLAN configuration PCs servers and other network devices communicate as if they were on the same physical LAN segment even though they may not be. The networking entities in VLAN configuration may be scattered across multiple physical networks but to the firewall they appear as if they were all connected through a single logical network interface.

Large networks having multiple diverse computer systems can be subdivided into two or more disjoint virtual networks called virtual domains . Each such virtual domain has its own routing network administration assess privileges as well as network security policies and configurations. Virtual domains can be used for example by separate organizations to share the same firewall routing hardware. the networking interfaces of which can be segregated into disjoint routing domains which may be administered by different users. Traffic originating from one such virtual domains can only be routed within the same virtual domain.

Unfortunately the existing firewall systems are deficient in their ability to handle disjoint routing and configuration domains in a scalable and efficient manner. Therefore what is needed is a scalable firewall system with an ability to manage virtual networking domains in an efficient manner.

The inventive methodology is directed to methods and systems that substantially obviate one or more of the above and other problems associated with conventional techniques for content processing in a virtual domain environment.

One aspect of the inventive concept is a method computer programming product and a computerized system for processing network content associated with multiple virtual domains. According to the inventive method a number of interfaces are defined with each of the interfaces corresponding to a virtual routing domain. The system then initiates a service process for processing network packets based on a specific content processing policy. When a network connection request involving a network entity associated with a virtual domain is received the system opens a communication channel between the service process and a kernel. The opened communication channel is used to transfer network content associated with the virtual domain between service process and the kernel of the firewall system. The transferred network content is processed in the service process based on the content processing policy in affect.

In accordance with a feature of the invention when a second connection request involving a second network entity associated with a second virtual domain is received the system opens a second communication channel between the service process and a second interface corresponding to the second virtual domain. The system then uses the second opened communication channel to transfer second network content between service process and the second interface. The network content associated with the second virtual domain is processed in the same service process based on the content processing policy in affect.

In accordance with another feature of the invention a separate content processing policy may be provided for each virtual domain.

In accordance with yet another feature of the invention the content processing policy may include anti malware scanning. The content processing policy may also include content filtering Virtual Private Network VPN processing as well as network monitoring and logging.

In accordance with a further feature of the invention network content is transferred in accordance with a message exchange protocol.

In accordance with yet further feature of the invention the processing includes retrieving configuration settings corresponding to the virtual domain. The configuration settings may be retrieved using at least one attribute of the opened communication channel corresponding to the virtual domain. Such attributes may include for example the socket identifier which may be used to derive the virtual domain identifier which in turn may be utilized to lookup the appropriate configuration settings from a database or other storage system.

In accordance with yet further feature of the invention the same service process is used to process data associated with other virtual domains.

In accordance with yet further feature of the invention upon receipt of the second connection request associated with the second virtual domain the system launches a second service process to process the network content associated with the second virtual domain. Different service processes are executed on different CPUs.

In accordance with yet further feature of the invention the second service process may be initiated by the first service process. The service processes may communicate via message exchange. The messages may include information on a third connection request that was received by the inventive system. The third connection request may originate either from the first two virtual domains or from a third virtual domain.

In accordance with yet further feature of the invention the system may provide a central configuration store for providing configuration information to the service processes. The system may further include a log manager for processing logging information received from the service processes.

In accordance with yet further feature of the invention virtual domain state information may be cached in the service process.

Additional aspects related to the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows and in part will be obvious from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. Aspects of the invention may be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations of various elements and aspects particularly pointed out in the following detailed description and the appended claims.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing and the following descriptions are exemplary and explanatory only and are not intended to limit the claimed invention or application thereof in any manner whatsoever.

In the following detailed description reference will be made to the accompanying drawing s in which identical functional elements are designated with like numerals. The aforementioned accompanying drawings show by way of illustration and not by way of limitation specific embodiments and implementations consistent with principles of the present invention. These implementations are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention and it is to be understood that other implementations may be utilized and that structural changes and or substitutions of various elements may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be construed in a limited sense. Additionally the various embodiments of the invention as described may be implemented in the form of a software running on a general purpose computer in the form of a specialized hardware or combination of software and hardware.

The inventor recognized that it would have been advantageous to provide a mechanism whereby network content for multiple virtual domains is managed in a scalable and efficient manner. Specifically an embodiment of the inventive technique can simultaneously process network content associated with multiple virtual domains.

The network traffic transmitted by the firewall is processed by firewall daemon processes and . Specifically in the shown embodiment service daemon process performs content filtering for virtual domains and while service daemon handles anti malware scanning of the content. Service processes and communicate with interfaces and through separate communication channels and specifically sockets . In an embodiment of the inventive system each of these sockets has its own receive buffer such that packets from one virtual domain do not overflow the buffer corresponding to another virtual domain. Therefore overflow of a buffer corresponding to one particular domain would not affect the traffic in other virtual domains.

In an embodiment of the invention shown in the daemon processes and aggregate sockets from multiple virtual domains and thereby reducing the per domain overhead associated with executing the daemon processes and . In this configuration when connections from multiple virtual domains are aggregated in the same daemon processes the daemons and need to be aware of the identity of the virtual domain for which traffic is being processed. In one embodiment of the invention this is accomplished by examining attributes of the associated socket and specifically socket identifier socket id . Because in the configuration shown in the virtual domain is uniquely identified by the logical or physical interface on the other side of the connection the virtual domain identification information can be successfully derived from the socket id resource of the respective socket.

Additionally aggregation of services for multiple virtual domains within a single daemon process may require it to frequently access the domain state as well as other configuration information. To this end the embodiments of the inventive system shown in include a configuration management server which provides centralized configuration information management and update notifications for multiple virtual domains. The configuration server manages configuration for all virtual domains simultaneously and provides application programming interface API to answer configuration information queries from any of the daemon applications and on the systems and .

In the shown embodiment of the invention the configuration management server references an associated configuration information database storing information on configuration of other modules in the system parameters global to the system which are common across multiple virtual domains as well as information on configuration of each separate virtual domain and . The domain configuration information stored in the database may include the specifics of the content processing policy for that virtual domain. The database may be implemented as an actual database either local or remote or alternatively it may be implemented as a configuration file or a series of such files. The configuration server may also provide a series of APIs for managing the configuration data stored in the associated configuration database .

In most cases the aforementioned configuration database can only be modified through a series of configuration server APIs that provide limited access to the users with reference to their configured permissions. These permissions may be designed to be sufficiently granular. For example they may be allocated on a per virtual domain basis. The configuration management server ensures that an administrator for one virtual domain cannot change parameters that affect other disjoint virtual domains. In one embodiment the internal state of the configuration server is organized in an optimized format that does not store the data for each virtual domain separately. However the configuration data would still be presented on a per virtual domain basis at the API level.

Because different administrators may administer different virtual domains an embodiment of the inventive system provides for at least one user account in the firewall system with the privilege to add or delete virtual domains. When a virtual domain is added or deleted all interested applications such as daemons and in the inventive firewall system with sufficient privileges are sent a notification message to notify them of the event. In response to the notification such applications can then take whatever action is necessary e.g. add a handler for the new virtual domain or clean up the obsolete virtual domain s state . When a configuration for an existing virtual domain stored in the database is modified a similar notification message is also sent to inform interested applications about the change. As it would appreciated by those of skill in the art because virtual domain may be administered separately it is desirable that a configuration change in one virtual domain not cause a global action such as a reboot.

A log server may aggregate log messages from multiple daemons and servicing multiple virtual domains and . Each log message and received from the applications and may either be classified as global or it may contain an attribute to specify which virtual domain it pertains to. In an embodiment of the invention the action performed by the log server on each log message e.g. discarding storing locally forwarding to an external server may be different for each log type as well. In an embodiment of the invention for future convenience in archiving and storing the logs log messages pertaining to each virtual domain are stored in separate files. In another embodiment separate files are utilized to store different categories of logs. Because the number of active log files and sockets may exceed the limit of the operating system an embodiment of the logging server keeps a table of open file descriptors for each active log file and closes the file descriptors of inactive log files as dictated by an Least Recently Used LRU algorithm well known to persons of skill in the art. Specifically in accordance with the aforementioned LRU algorithm the embodiment of the inventive system closes the least recently used descriptors first. To this end the system uses the aforementioned file descriptor table to keep track of which log files were used as well as when the last use took place. In another embodiment a Pseudo LRU algorithm is utilized which employs a probabilistic scheme that almost always discards one of the least recently used items.

In an embodiment of the inventive concept daemon processes and which handle content filtering and or anti malware services for multiple virtual domains aggregate all of their virtual domain associated internal variables into a structure known as a virtual domain state. A daemon process or may create and manage multiple instances of such structure each corresponding to a different virtual domain.

A global reference or pointer variable for each daemon process and is set to point to the instance of the aforesaid virtual domain state data structure corresponding to the presently active virtual domain. Each entry point into the daemon service process such as modules that read data from a socket event notification handlers signal handlers etc. update this pointer to the current virtual domain based on an attribute in the received message. Alternatively the information on the currently active virtual domain may be derived from the message itself as was described above. For example in the case of socket descriptors the daemon process may lookup the identity of the associated virtual domain based on the value of the socket id variable associated with the socket.

For added fault tolerance the daemon process may optionally reset the described current virtual domain reference variable at each exit point. In an embodiment of the daemon module various functions can access any variables pertaining to an active virtual domain as if they were global variables by using an indirect reference via the aforesaid current virtual domain reference variable. Additionally the daemon module may provide a set of callback functions to handle creation of a new virtual domain state in response to a virtual domain addition message removing of a virtual domain state in response to a deletion message and modification a virtual domain state in response to a configuration change.

In an embodiment of the inventive firewall system some daemon processes may act as server processes forking child processes to handle specific incoming connections. In certain well known protocols e.g. PPTP L2TP or HTTP the child process may even fork further processes. In an embodiment of the inventive technique in order to reduce process overhead on the system it may be advantageous to aggregate not just the server processes for the virtual domains but the child processes as well. This is achieved with the use of extra notification messages from the parent process to the child process. When a new session is created rather than forking a new child process the parent process may allocate that session to an already existent child. Specifically the parent encapsulates all initial state parameters into a message that is sent to the child. The child then creates a session state structure which is analogous to the aforementioned virtual domain state and processing of multiple simultaneous sessions is accomplished in a described manner. It is not necessary that all sessions from a single virtual domain be allocated to the same child process however there may often be a performance advantage to doing so. In order to properly distribute the connections among child processes in one embodiment of the invention the parent process receives a notification when a session is disconnected which allows the parent process to track the number of open sessions for each of its children.

The inventive firewall system may also comprise functionality for handling network content not associated with any of the managed virtual domains. Such out of band content includes communications between multiple nodes in a high availability HA cluster communications with network enabled off board hardware such as a server chassis management system or connections from a terminal server. In most cases traffic from these networks should be kept separate from other network traffic. To avoid mixing the out of band traffic with the filtered network content while still permitting routing in one embodiment of the invention a separate virtual domain is provided to contain the out of band management traffic.
