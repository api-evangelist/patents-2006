The present invention relates to a mating system for joining together various parts of a turbine engine component.

Turbine engine components are often formed by multiple parts which have to be joined together. Most frequently the parts are joined together by a plurality of fasteners. Due to the complexity of the parts and the little room for mechanics to assemble them the cost of assembling and disassembling the parts can be great. Additionally the cost of manufacturing the parts can be significant.

There is needed a mating system for joining various parts of a turbine engine component which uses no fasteners in the mating interface and which facilitates removal and assembly in the field.

The present invention provides a means for assembling a first part of a turbine engine component such as a full hoop flange fastened to a second part such as a rigid interface to a plurality of other parts such as two half hoop split flange parts with no fasteners in the mating interface.

In accordance with the present invention there is provided a turbine engine component broadly comprising an annular flange at least one element to be mated to the flange and mating means for joining the at least one element to the flange. The mating means includes a first annular groove in the flange which groove has two opposed planar wall portions for preventing axial movement of the at least one element relative to the flange. In a preferred embodiment the mating means also includes a second annular groove in the flange. A sealing element is positioned within the second annular groove.

Further in accordance with the present invention there is provided an annular flange to be used in the mating system of the present invention. The annular flange broadly comprises a first annular groove in the flange which first annular groove has a first planar wall and a second planar wall and a third planar wall adjacent the second planar wall. The third planar wall is angled with respect to the second planar wall so as to form a substantially V shaped groove with the first planar wall.

Still further in accordance with the present invention there is provided a mating system for joining a first part to a second part. The mating system broadly comprises a first annular groove in the first part an angled surface on the first part adjacent the first annular groove a tongue on the second part for insertion into the first annular groove and a mating angled surface on the second part for abutting the angled surface on the first part when the tongue is inserted into the first annular groove.

Other details of the split flange V groove and anti rotation mating system of the present invention as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.

Referring now to the drawings illustrates a turbine engine component such as a duct pipe in which a drive assembly not shown may be positioned. The turbine engine component includes a full hoop or annular flange to which duct pipe halfs and are attached. Each duct pipe half and has a half hoop or semi annular configuration. The duct pipe half has a plurality of spaced apart split flanges . The duct pipe half has a plurality of mating spaced apart split flanges which abut the flanges when the duct pipe halfs and are assembled and abut each other. As will be discussed later a fastener such as a bolt or screw may be used to join each pair of split flanges and and thus the duct pipe halfs and together.
