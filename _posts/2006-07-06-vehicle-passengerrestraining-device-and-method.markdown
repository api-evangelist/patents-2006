The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 of Japanese Patent Application No. 2005 198657 titled VEHICLE PASSENGER RESTRAINING DEVICE AND METHOD filed on Jul. 7 2005 the entire content of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention pertains to a passenger restraining device and method for a vehicle that restrains the passenger when the vehicle rolls over.

Technology already exists for a conventional passenger restraining device in which airbags are housed in a folded state along the front header of the upper edge of the windshield and the front pillar of the side edge of the windshield so as to deploy above the passenger s head when the vehicle rolls over e.g. unexamined Japanese Patent Application Publication No. H2003 63342 Paragraph 3 FIG. 1 . However for such conventional passenger restraining devices since it was necessary to deploy the airbag up to the top of the passenger s head the airbag typically needs to be increased in size resulting in a very large scale device of increased cost.

For the present invention a vehicle passenger restraining device and method that can restrain the passenger when the vehicle rolls over without using a large scale device is provided. One characteristic of the vehicle restraining device and method for the present invention is that the rollover of the vehicle is detected or predicted and in addition to a front airbag being deployed in front of the passenger the passenger is also pushed forward. According to the vehicle passenger restraining device for the present invention the passenger is pushed forward when a vehicle rollover is detected or predicted so the passenger can be pushed forward and held by the front airbag that has deployed allowing for restraint of the passenger without the use of a large scale device and suppression of the movement of the passenger from the seat.

Next is provided a detailed explanation of an embodiment of the present invention with reference to the drawings.

The vehicle passenger restraining device for the present embodiment is applied to front seat . Front seat includes of the driver s seat and the passenger s seat that are disposed so as to face instrument panel positioned at the front portion of the inside of the vehicle as shown in . The restraining device detects the seating condition of passenger M. When the vehicle body side member that is positioned in front of passenger M while in the passenger seat the restraining device is instrument panel . When the vehicle body side member that is positioned in front of passenger M while in the driver s seat the restraining device is steering wheel . For one embodiment the restraining device includes front distance estimating device for estimating the distance L in front of the passenger that is between vehicle body side members and . The restraining also includes device roll sensor which is the rollover detection device for detecting the rollover of the vehicle body. The restraining device further includes front airbag that deploys in front of passenger M when the vehicle body rolls over and rear airbag which acts as a pushing device for pushing the passenger forward. Rear airbag along with the deployment of said front airbag push passenger M forward while the passenger is held in a seated position in relation to seat cushion when it is estimated that the distance L in front of the passenger is a predetermined value or more and it is determined that the vehicle body has rolled over.

For one embodiment front airbag is deployed in front of passenger M and the passenger is pushed forward so as to be held in a seated position in relation to the seat cushion when the distance that is between the distance L in front of passenger M and the vehicle body side member that is positioned in front of passenger M which is instrument panel or steering wheel is a predetermined value or more.

Front seat is equipped with seat cushion which is installed on the vehicle body floor via the seat slider and the seat lifter and seatback which is attached at the rear end of seat cushion by means of a reclining mechanism so that it can tilt back and forth freely. In addition for one embodiment an ordinary driver s airbag housed in steering wheel or an ordinary passenger s airbag housed in the glove box portion of instrument panel can be used for front airbag .

The seat slider slides seat cushion back and forth by means of seat slider drive device the seat lifter raises seat cushion by means of seat lifter drive device and the reclining mechanism tilts seatback back and forth by means of reclining drive device . Seat slider drive device seat lifter drive device and reclining drive device are each provided with a sensor that detects their respective drive amounts in order to obtain information pertaining to the seat slide position seat lifter position and reclining angle.

Rear airbag is housed in the portion of seatback that corresponds with the upper body of passenger M and by deploying said rear airbag between seatback and the upper body of passenger M passenger M is bent forward as shown in .

Deployment of front airbag and rear airbag is controlled by inflator control means . Inflator control means receives the signal from front distance estimating device that estimated that the distance L in front of the passenger was a predetermined value or more and the rollover signal detected by roll sensor . Inflator control means operates inflators not shown that are provided separately for each of front airbag and rear airbag and deploys each of airbags and . Front distance estimating device detects the seating condition of passenger M from the information pertaining to the body weight of passenger M the seat slide position and the reclining angle of seatback . The body weight of passenger M is detected by load sensor provided on seat cushion the seat slide position is detected by a sensor provided on seat slider drive device and the reclining angle is detected by a sensor provided on reclining drive device .

As shown in the flowchart in once the deployment control of aforementioned front airbag and rear airbag performed by inflator control means is started by turning the ignition switch ON the seating condition of the passenger is detected at Step S the vehicle rollover is detected at Step S and the seatbelt wearing situation of seatbelt is detected by seatbelt wearing detection device . Then at Step S it is determined whether or not the distance L in front of the passenger is a predetermined value or more and if it is a predetermined value or more YES the process proceeds to Step S where it is determined whether or not the vehicle is in a rolled over state and if it is in a rolled over state YES front airbag is deployed at Step S. After front airbag has been deployed if it is determined that seatbelt is not being worn NO at Step S rear airbag is deployed at Step S.

If it is determined at Step S that the distance L in front of the passenger is less than the predetermined value NO the control process is ended. If it is determined at Step S that the vehicle is not in the rolled over state NO the control process is ended. If it is determined at Step S that seatbelt is being worn YES the control process is ended. For one embodiment the process in the flowchart is repeatedly performed for predetermined short increments of time until the ignition is OFF in order to manage the deployment control of aforementioned front airbag and rear airbag .

Furthermore when referring to it can be seen that for one embodiment a larger capacity airbag may be used for front airbag than for rear airbag so that the deployment of front airbag begins first after a rollover is detected rollover detection timing T and deployment of rear airbag begins after a predetermined amount of time has elapsed. After this takes place the time in which front airbag reaches the maximum internal pressure PMAX and the time in which rear airbag reaches the maximum internal pressure PMAX are set to be approximately the same deployment completion timing T . In this manner passenger M can be firmly pushed against front airbag .

In addition the internal pressure of both front airbag and rear airbag drops after the maximum internal pressures PMAX and PMAX have been maintained for a few seconds. In this manner as shown in for the first seating condition of the passenger where the physical size of passenger M is small e.g. less than about 60 kilograms the seat slide position is in the middle the reclining angle is small e.g. about 21 degrees from the vertical or less and a seatbelt is not being worn or for the second seating condition as shown in where the physical size of passenger M is average e.g. about 60 kilograms to about 85 kilograms the seat slide position is to the rear the reclining angle is large e.g. greater than about 21 degrees from the vertical and a seatbelt is not being worn restraining device in which front airbag and rear airbag are controlled provides distance between passenger M and deployed front airbag so that rear airbag is operated deployed in either situation as shown in and . On the other hand for the third seating condition where the physical size of passenger M is large e.g. greater than about 85 kilograms the seat slide position is forward and the reclining angle is small as shown in since the physical size of passenger M is large and the seat slide position is toward the front passenger M can be sufficiently restrained between deployed front airbag and seatback so rear airbag is not operated. For the third seating condition shown in seatbelt can either be worn or not worn.

According to the embodiment of passenger restraining device that has the aforementioned constitution when the distance L in front of the passenger is a predetermined value or more and when the vehicle body rolls over rear airbag is deployed so as to bend and push passenger M forward so the passenger can be pushed and held in place by front airbag and the movement of the passenger from the seat can be prevented. Furthermore since passenger M can be restrained by sandwiching the passenger between front airbag which has deployed due to the detection of a rollover and rear airbag which is supported by aforementioned seatback passenger M can be prevented from moving from front seat even when not wearing seatbelt . Then by pushing passenger M forward while maintaining the seated position in relation to seat cushion when a rollover takes place the objective of restraining passenger M can be met and passenger restraining device can be simplified.

The device that pushes the passenger forward for the present embodiment comprises rear airbag that deploys between the upper body of passenger M and seatback so the upper body of passenger M can be bent forward by deploying aforementioned rear airbag and passenger M can be firmly pushed forward and restrained between rear airbag and front airbag . In this manner by constructing the device for pushing the passenger forward with rear airbag and simply adding this rear airbag to seatback in addition to front airbag which is normally installed for front end collisions passenger restraining device can be simplified resulting in a more compact device and a lower system cost. Furthermore by deploying aforementioned rear airbag passenger M can be bent in the forward direction resulting in an increase in the space above passenger M s head when a rollover takes place and a decrease in the interference with the ceiling surface.

Front distance estimating device detects the seating condition of passenger M based on the information for the body weight of passenger M the seat slide position and the reclining angle of seatback in order to estimate the distance L in front of the passenger thus allowing for accurate detection of the seating condition of passenger M and a more precise estimation of the distance L in front of the passenger consequently improving the restraining effectiveness of passenger M by passenger restraining device .

Rear airbag operates for both the first seating condition in which the physical size of passenger M is small the seat slide position is in the middle the reclining angle is small and a seatbelt is not being worn and the second seating condition in which the physical size of passenger M is average the seat slide position is to the rear the reclining angle is large and a seatbelt is not being worn. Therefore when a female passenger with a small physical size who is not wearing seatbelt is seated unrestrained the first seating condition or when an adult male passenger with an average physical size who is not wearing a seatbelt is seated unrestrained the second seating condition and the vehicle body rolls over passenger M can be firmly restrained between front airbag and rear airbag which is supported by seat cushion . For the third seating condition in which the physical size of the passenger is large the seat slide position is to the front and the reclining angle is small the rear airbag does not operate. Therefore when an adult male with a large physical size is seated in a forward position that is relatively cramped and a rollover takes place rear airbag does not deploy and passenger M can be restrained by means of front airbag between said airbag and seatback only.

Although the present invention was explained using the aforementioned embodiment as an example the present invention is not restricted to this embodiment and various other types of embodiments may be used as long as they do not deviate from the gist of the present invention. Therefore although the device for pushing the passenger forward was constituted with rear airbag reclining drive device that tilts seatback forward or seat slide drive device that moves seat forward could also be used refer to so the present invention could be constituted with at least one of rear airbag reclining drive device and seat slide drive device . When reclining drive device or seat slide drive device are used since these devices and are already existing technology the constitution of passenger restraining device can be simplified and the device can be offered at a lower cost.

Front distance estimating device was constituted to detect the seating condition of passenger M by inputting the information for the body weight of passenger M the seat slide position and the reclining angle of the seatback but the body weight seat slide position and reclining angle need not all be used and the seating condition can be detected based on information for one of these. Furthermore sensor was used to detect the vehicle body rollover but the rollover state of the vehicle body could also be detected by integrating the output value from side impact G sensor and determining the rollover based on the point at which this integrated value reaches a predetermined value or more . Or as shown in a rollover could be predicted based on the output value from the side impact G sensor or roll sensor and the pushing timing of the passenger restraining device could be accelerated.
