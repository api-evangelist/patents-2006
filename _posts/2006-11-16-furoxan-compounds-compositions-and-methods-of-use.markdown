The furoxan compounds of the invention donate or transfer a biologically active form of nitrogen monoxide i.e. nitric oxide .

Compounds contemplated for use of the invention e.g. furoxan compounds that contain at lest two furoxan moieties are optionally used in combination with nitric oxide enhancing compounds that release nitric oxide increase endogeneous levels of nitric oxide or otherwise directly or indirectly deliver or transfer a biologically active form of nitrogen monoxide to a site of its intended activity such as on a cell membrane in vivo.

Nitrogen monoxide can exist in three forms NO nitroxyl NO. nitric oxide and NO nitrosonium . NO. is a highly reactive short lived species that is potentially toxic to cells. This is critical because the pharmacological efficacy of NO depends upon the form in which it is delivered. In contrast to the nitric oxide radical NO. nitrosonium NO does not react with Oor O species and functionalities capable of transferring and or releasing NO and NO are also resistant to decomposition in the presence of many redox metals. Consequently administration of charged NO equivalents positive and or negative does not result in the generation of toxic by products or the elimination of the active NO group.

The term nitric oxide encompasses uncharged nitric oxide NO. and charged nitrogen monoxide species preferably charged nitrogen monoxide species such as nitrosonium ion NO and nitroxyl ion NO . The reactive form of nitric oxide can be provided by gaseous nitric oxide.

The furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compounds and or therapeutic agent can be incorporated into a natural or synthetic matrix which can then be applied with specificity to a biological site of interest. Accordingly the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent is bound to the matrix which means that the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent are physically and or chemically associated with part of incorporated with attached to or contained within the natural or synthetic matrix. In one embodiment physical association or bonding can be achieved for example by coprecipitation of the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent with the matrix. In another embodiment chemical association or bonding can be achieved by for example covalent bonding of a nucleophilic moiety of the furoxan compound of the invention and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent to the matrix such that the furoxan compound is part of the matrix itself. In yet another embodiment the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent can be incorporated into a porous layer of the matrix or into pores included in the natural or synthetic matrix. The manner in which the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent is associated part of attached to incorporated with or contained within i.e. bound to the matrix is inconsequential to the invention and all means of association incorporation attachment and bonding are contemplated herein. Incorporation of the furoxan compounds and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compounds and or therapeutic agents into the matrix results in site specific application thereby enhancing selectivity of action for the released nitric oxide and the furoxan compound. Additionally incorporation of the furoxan compound into the matrix reduces the rate of release of the nitric oxide and the furoxan compound. This prolongs the release of the nitric oxide and the furoxan compound thereby allowing for efficient dosing to achieve a desired biological effect so that the frequency of dosing can be reduced.

Any of a wide variety of natural or synthetic polymers can be used as the matrix in the context of the invention. It is only necessary for the matrix to be biologically acceptable. Exemplary matrixes suitable for use in the invention are polymers including for example polyolefins such as polystyrene polyalkylenes polypropylene polyethylene high molecular weight polyethylene polyethylene oxides high density polyethylene polytetrafluorethylene polyvinylidene difluoride and polyvinylchloride polyethylenimine or derivatives thereof polyethers such as polyethylene glycol polyesters such as poly L lactic acid poly D L lactic poly D lactic polyglycolic acid poly lactide glycolide polyethylene terephthalate polyether sulfones polyanhydrides polyhydroxybutyrates polyamides such as nylon polyurethanes polyurethane copolymers such as pellethane polymers polyacrylates such as polymethacrylate poly 2 methacryloyloxyethyl 2 trimethylammonium ethyl phosphate inner salt co n dodecyl methacrylate methylmethacrylate polyvinylpyrrolidones cross linked polyvinylpyrrolidones polyvinyl alcohols polyvinyl acetates halogenated polyalkylenes polyvinyl ethers polyvinyl aromatics polyurethanes polyorthoesters polycarbonates polyalkylenes polycarboxylic acids such as for example polyacrylic acids polycaprolactone polyhydroxybutyrate valerate silicones siloxane polymers hyaluronic acid mixtures of polymers such as polylactic acid polylysine copolymers polyalkylene styrene copolymers polyurethane polyester copolymers polyurethane polyether copolymers polyethylene oxide polypropylene oxides ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers nylon polyether copolymers such as vestamid biopolymers such as peptides polypeptides proteins chitosan chitosan derivatives gelatin oligonucleotides antibodies peptide hormones glycoproteins glycogen and nucleic acids fibrin collagen glycosaminoglycans polysaccharides such as for example cellulose starches dextrans alginates derivatives such as cellulose acetate cellulose nitrate starburst dendrimers natural fibrous matrix such as filter paper synthetic fibrous matrix materials such as three dimensional lattice of synthetic polymers and copolymers and the like. Exemplary polymers are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 705 583 5 770 645 5 994 444 6 087 479 and 6 153 252 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In some embodiments the matrix materials are polylactic acid polyurethane and polyalkene polymers. In another embodiment the matrix material is nitrosated and or nitrosylated and or contains a nitroxide moiety.

The physical and structural characteristics of the matrixes suitable for use in the invention are not critical but depend on the application. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that where the matrix compound and or composition of the invention is intended for local relatively short term administration or similar administration they need not be biodegradable. For some uses such as postangioplasty coronary bypass surgery or intimal hyperplasia associated with vascular or non vascular graft implants or the like it may be desirable for the matrix to slowly dissolve in a physiological environment or to be biodegradable.

The furoxan compound and optionally the nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent bound to the matrix may be administered in a wide variety of forms or delivery means. Any delivery means should adequately protect the integrity of the nitric oxide prior to its release and should control the release of the nitric oxide at such a rate in such an amount and in such a location as to serve as an effective means for prevention and or treatment of cardiovascular diseases and disorders including restenosis. Delivery means for local administration include but are not limited to those described herein. Delivery means for systemic administration include for example solutions suspensions emulsions capsules powders sachets tablets effervescent tablets topical patches lozenges aerosols liposomes microparticles microspheres beads and the like. The matrix itself may be structurally sufficient to serve as a delivery means.

The furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent bound to the matrix can also be used to coat all or a portion of the surface of a medical device that comes into contact with blood including blood components and blood products vascular or non vascular tissue thereby rendering the surface passive. Alternatively the furoxan compound and the nitric oxide enhancing compound and optionally the therapeutic agent bound to the matrix can also be used to coat all or a portion of the surface of a medical device that comes into contact with blood including blood components and blood products vascular or non vascular tissue thereby rendering the surface passive. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 665 077 5 797 887 5 824 049 and 5 837 008 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety describe methods for coating all or a portion of a surface of a medical device. Thus for example i all or a portion of the medical device may be coated with the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compounds and or therapeutic agents either as the coating per se or bound to a matrix as described herein or ii all or a portion of the medical device may be produced from a material which includes the fliroxan compound of the invention and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent per se or bound to a matrix as described herein.

It is also contemplated that artificial surfaces will vary depending on the nature of the surface and such characteristics including contour crystallinity hydrophobicity hydrophilicity capacity for hydrogen bonding and flexibility of the molecular backbone and polymers. Therefore using routine methods one of ordinary skill will be able to customize the coating technique by adjusting such parameters as the amount of adduct length of treatment temperature diluents and storage conditions in order to provide optimal coating of each particular type of surface.

After the medical device or artificial material has been coated with the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent or with the furoxan compound and optionally the therapeutic agent it will be suitable for its intended use including for example implantation as a heart valve insertion as a catheter insertion as a stent or for cardiopulmonary oxygenation or hemodialysis.

In another embodiment the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent can be directly incorporated into the pores or reservoirs of the medical device i.e. without a matrix or polymer . A coating of a biocompatible polymer material could be applied over the medical device which would control the diffusion of the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent from the pores or reservoirs of the medical device. The manner in which the compound of the furoxan invention and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent is associated part of attached to incorporated with or contained within i.e. bound to the medical device is inconsequential to the invention and all means of association incorporation attachment and bonding are contemplated herein. Incorporation of the furoxan compound and optionally nitric oxide enhancing compounds and or therapeutic agents into the pores or reservoirs of the medical device results in site specific application thereby enhancing selectivity of action for the released nitric oxide and compound of the invention. Additionally incorporation of the furoxan compound into the pores or reservoirs of the medical device reduces the rate of release of the nitric oxide and the furoxan compound. This prolongs the release of the nitric oxide and the furoxan compound thereby allowing for efficient dosing to achieve a desired biological effect so that the frequency of dosing can be reduced.

When administered separately the furoxan compound nitric oxide enhancing compound and or therapeutic agent can be administered about the same time as part of the overall treatment regimen i.e. as a combination therapy. About the same time includes administering the furoxan compound simultaneously sequentially at the same time at different times on the same day or on different days as long as they are administered as part of an overall treatment regimen i.e. combination therapy or a therapeutic cocktail.

When administered in vivo the compounds and compositions of the invention can be administered in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and in dosages described herein. When the compounds and compositions of the invention are administered as a combination of at least one furoxan compound and or at least one nitric oxide enhancing compound and or at least one therapeutic agent they can also be used in combination with one or more additional compounds which are known to be effective against the specific disease state targeted for treatment. The nitric oxide enhancing compounds therapeutic agents and or other additional compounds can be administered simultaneously with subsequently to or prior to administration of the furoxan compound.

Delivery means for systemic administration include for example solutions suspensions emulsions capsules powders sachets tablets effervescent tablets topical patches lozenges aerosols liposomes microparticles microspheres beads and the like.

Transdermal compound administration which is known to one skilled in the art involves the delivery of pharmaceutical compounds via percutaneous passage of the compound into the systemic circulation of the patient. Topical administration can also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdemmal patches or iontophoresis devices. Other components can be incorporated into the transdermal patches as well. For example compositions and or transdermal patches can be formulated with one or more preservatives or bacteriostatic agents including but not limited to methyl hydroxybenzoate propyl hydroxybenzoate chlorocresol benzalkonium chloride and the like.

Nos. 5 262 165 5 948 433 6 010 715 and 6 071 531 the disclosure of each of which are incorporated herein in their entirety.

Solid dosage forms for oral administration can include capsules sustained release capsules tablets sustained release tablets chewable tablets sublingual tablets effervescent tablets pills powders granules and gels. In such solid dosage forms the active compounds can be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose lactose or starch. Such dosage forms can also comprise as in normal practice additional substances other than inert diluents e.g. lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules tablets effervescent tablets and pills the dosage forms can also comprise buffering agents. Soft gelatin capsules can be prepared to contain a mixture of the active compounds or compositions of the invention and vegetable oil. Hard gelatin capsules can contain granules of the active compound in combination with a solid pulverulent carrier such as lactose saccharose sorbitol mannitol potato starch corn starch amylopectin cellulose derivatives of gelatin. Tablets and pills can be prepared with enteric coatings.

Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions solutions suspensions syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art such as water. Such compositions can also comprise adjuvants such as wetting agents emulsifying and suspending agents and sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents.

Suppositories for vaginal or rectal administration of the compounds and compositions of the invention can be prepared by mixing the compounds or compositions with a suitable nonirritating excipient such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols which are solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature such that they will melt in the rectum and release the drug.

Injectable preparations for example sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing agents wetting agents and or suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be used are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Sterile fixed oils are also conventionally used as a solvent or suspending medium.

The compositions of this invention can further include conventional excipients i.e. pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral application which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include for example water salt solutions alcohol vegetable oils polyethylene glycols gelatin lactose amylose magnesium stearate talc surfactants silicic acid viscous paraffin perfume oil fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides petroethral fatty acid esters hydroxymethyl cellulose polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like. The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents e.g. lubricants preservatives stabilizers wetting agents emulsifiers salts for influencing osmotic pressure buffers colorings flavoring and or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously react with the active compounds. For parenteral application particularly suitable vehicles consist of solutions preferably oily or aqueous solutions as well as suspensions emulsions or implants. Aqueous suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension and include for example sodium carboxymethyl cellulose sorbitol and or dextran. Optionally the suspension may also contain stabilizers.

The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting agents emulsifying agents and or pH buffering agents. The composition can be a liquid solution suspension emulsion tablet pill capsule sustained release formulation or powder. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulations can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate and the like.

Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the compounds or compositions of the invention including for example encapsulation in liposomes microbubbles emulsions microparticles microcapsules and the like. The required dosage can be administered as a single unit or in a sustained release form.

The bioavailability of the compositions can be enhanced by micronization of the formulations using conventional techniques such as grinding milling spray drying and the like in the presence of suitable excipients or agents such as phospholipids or surfactants.

Sustained release dosage forms of the invention may comprise microparticles and or nanoparticles having a therapeutic agent dispersed therein or may comprise the therapeutic agent in pure preferably crystalline solid form. For sustained release administration microparticle dosage forms comprising pure preferably crystalline therapeutic agents are administered. The therapeutic dosage forms of this aspect of the invention may be of any configuration suitable for sustained release.

Nanoparticle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms are preferably biodegradable and optionally bind to the vascular smooth muscle cells and enter those cells primarily by endocytosis. The biodegradation of the nanoparticles occurs over time e.g. 30 to 120 days or 10 to 21 days in prelysosomic vesicles and lysosomes. Larger microparticle therapeutic dosage forms of the invention release the therapeutic agents for subsequent target cell uptake with only a few of the smaller microparticles entering the cell by phagocytosis. A practitioner in the art will appreciate that the precise mechanism by which a target cell assimilates and metabolizes a dosage form of the invention depends on the morphology physiology and metabolic processes of those cells. The size of the particle sustained release therapeutic dosage forms is also important with respect to the mode of cellular assimilation. For example the smaller nanoparticles can flow with the interstitial fluid between cells and penetrate the infused tissue. The larger microparticles tend to be more easily trapped interstitially in the infused primary tissue and thus are useful to deliver anti proliferative therapeutic agents.

Particular sustained release dosage forms of the invention comprise biodegradable microparticles or nanoparticles. More particularly biodegradable microparticles or nanoparticles are formed of a polymer containing matrix that biodegrades by random nonenzymatic hydrolytic scissioning to release therapeutic agent thereby forming pores within the particulate structure.

In a particular embodiment the compositions of the invention are orally administered as a sustained release tablet or a sustained release capsule. For example the sustained release formulations can comprise an effective amount of at least one furoxan compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and optionally at least one nitric oxide enhancing compound or the sustained release formulations can comprise an effective amount of at least one furoxan compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least one nitric oxide enhancing compound and optionally at least one therapeutic agent

The compounds and compositions of the invention can be formulated as pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include for example alkali metal salts and addition salts of free acids or free bases. The nature of the salt is not critical provided that it is pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from an inorganic acid or from an organic acid. Examples of such inorganic acids include but are not limited to hydrochloric hydrobromic hydroiodic nitric carbonic sulfuric and phosphoric acid and the like. Appropriate organic acids include but are not limited to aliphatic cycloaliphatic aromatic heterocyclic carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids such as for example formic acetic propionic succinic glycolic gluconic lactic malic tartaric citric ascorbic glucuronic maleic fumaric pyruvic aspartic glutamic benzoic anthranilic mesylic salicylic p hydroxybenzoic phenylacetic mandelic embonic pamoic methanesulfonic ethanesulfonic benzenesulfonic pantothenic toluenesulfonic 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic sulfanilic stearic algenic hydroxybutyric cyclohexylaminosulfonic galactaric and galacturonic acid and the like. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include but are not limited to metallic salts made from aluminum calcium lithium magnesium potassium sodium and zinc or organic salts made from primary secondary and tertiary amines cyclic amines N N dibenzylethylenediamine chloroprocaine choline diethanolamine ethylenediamine meglumine N methylglucamine and procaine and the like. All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from the corresponding compound by reacting for example the appropriate acid or base with the compound. In one embodiment the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention do not include the nitrate salt.

Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells SMC and endothelial cells EC were supplied by Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville Inc. Walkersville MD . The smooth muscle cells were maintained in a basal medium EBM Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville Inc without phenol red and supplemented with 5 v v fetal bovine serum FBS human recombinant epidermal growth factor EGF human recombinant fibroblast growth factor FGF bovine insulin 50 g mL gentamicin sulfate and 50 ng mL amphotericin B all obtained from Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville Inc. as SMGM2 SingleQuots . The endothelial cells were grown in a modified EGM2 MV medium Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville Inc. which had the same phenol red free basal medium EBM as used in the smooth muscle cell medium but were supplemented with 5 v v fetal bovine serum FBS human recombinant epidermal growth factor EGF human recombinant fibroblast growth factor FGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF recombinant insulin like growth factor 1 IGF 1 ascorbic acid 50 g mL gentamicin sulfate and 50 ng mL amphotericin B all supplied by Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville Inc. as EGM2 MV SingleQuots . All cells were incubated under humidified 95 air 5 COat 37 C. Cells were used for experiments usually up to about 17 cumulative population doublings i.e. passage 9 and still exhibit their respective traits for smooth muscle or endothelial cells.

For the SMC EC Antiproliferation Assay the cells were seeded at 4 10viable cells in 2 mL of the appropriate medium per well of a Corning tissue culture 24 well plate Corning N.Y. . Stock solutions of the test compounds were prepared just prior to addition to the cells by dissolving in DMSO at a concentration 1000 times the highest concentration to be assayed. This stock solution was diluted as required with DMSO to the required concentration. On the same day the cells were seeded but after they had attached and spread out about 3 hr each test compound in varying concentrations 2 L of the diluted stock solutions was added to four replicate wells n 4 for each concentration. Control cultures received 2 L of DMSO per well n 4 . On the following morning the cultures were examined microscopically and their condition including evidence of cytotoxicity recorded. 68 hours after the addition of the test compound the cultures were examined microscopically and the viable cells counted with a hemacytometer following trypsinization with 0.25 trypsin 1 mM EDTA. Trypan Blue dye exclusion was used to discriminate between viable and dead cells. The results are presented as of the control viable cell count mean SEM and are used to determine the ICfor the inhibition of proliferation of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells. ICfor the test compounds are given in Table 1.
