The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to a quick release gun sight adapter. More specifically but without limitation the present invention relates to a quick release red dot gun sight adapter.

Currently typical military weapons such as guns utilize a fixed iron sight or a fixed red dot sight. Only one sight is attached to the weapon at a time. Often the red dot sight is unusable due to weather conditions such as precipitation therefore another type of sight such as the iron sight needs to be used. Each sight needs to be individually changed and adjusted. Changing sights is difficult and time consuming. Each time a sight is changed the weapon requires sighting in and the sights need to be adjusted. This wastes valuable time especially in military or force protection situations.

Thus there is a need in the art to provide a quick release gun sight adapter that allows both an iron sight and a red dot sight to be concurrently attached to a weapon and a quick release gun sight adapter without the limitations inherent in present methods.

The present invention is directed to a quick release gun sight adapter. The quick release gun sight adapter includes a scope adapter a red dot sight adapter a locking block a spring loaded ramped blade and a spring loaded latch piston. The scope adapter is attachable to a scope and the scope is attachable to a gun. The red dot sight adapter is attachable to a red dot sight and the ramped blade is attached to the red dot sight adapter. The ramped blade is rotatably attachable to the scope adapter and the scope adapter is rotatably adapted to hold the ramped blade such that when the ramped blade is attached to the scope adapter and when the ramped blade and the red dot sight adapter are rotated the ramped blade engages the locking block. When the ramped blade is further rotated the locking blade locks the ramped blade into place. The piston communicates with the locking block such that when actuated the piston engages the locking block such that the ramped blade and the red dot sight adapter may be rotated and unattached from the scope adapter.

It is a feature of the invention to provide a quick release gun sight adapter that allows two sight systems to be concurrently attached to a scope.

It is a feature of the invention to provide a quick release gun sight adapter that enables quick removal for in climate conditions to attain use of the back up iron sight.
