title: Continuous high-speed coating of finely ground particulates
abstract: A method for the continuous production of finely ground particulates coated with a barrier, or other desirable film wherein the coated particulates exhibit a diameter of less than 10 microns. In an exemplary embodiment, large coated particulates are introduced into a fluid energy, or jet mill, along with smaller, uncoated particulates. As the particulates collide within the mill they are comminuted, and an amount of coating is transferred from the coated particulates to the uncoated ones such that they become sufficiently coated and size-reduced to a desired size. Alternatively, uncoated particulates are milled and coated during their milling. Still alternatively, uncoated particulates are milled and subsequently directed through an atomized mist of coating material wherein the size of the mist droplets are as large, or larger than the directed particulates.

This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 596 777 filed Oct. 20 2005 the entire file wrapper contents of which provisional application are herein incorporated by reference as though set forth at length.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention described herein may be made used or licensed by or for the United States Government for government purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

This invention relates generally to the field of finely ground materials preparation and in particular how such processes combine with continuous methods for coating extremely fine particulates with polymeric material or other coating materials.

Finely ground particulates are known to have widespread applicability in a number of industries including pharmaceuticals cosmetics industrial coatings and energetics i.e. propellants explosives . In a number of these applications the particulates must be coated with certain other material s that impart desirable physical and or mechanical and or chemical characteristics to the particulates. Such particulate coatings include lubricants barrier films wetting agents polymers and or monomers.

One particularly important coated fine particulate is the extremely energetic high explosive cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX . Finely ground RDX is currently being employed as an ingredient in new Insensitive Munition IM explosive formulations and as an energetic enhancer in propellant formulations. Coating these materials generally enhances processability safety and shelf life.

Presently super fine coated RDX is manufactured in a multi step process which unfortunately exhibits a significant rework potential. Manufacturing methods that do not suffer from this rework infirmity would therefore represent a significant advance in the art and in the particular case of energetics the safety of the end product s .

The present invention provides a continuous process for reducing the size of particulate materials and coating the size reduced particulates with a barrier or other desirable film. The process continuously processes the particulates in a fluid energy or jet mill.

According to the present invention relatively large coated particles are introduced into the fluid energy mill along with smaller uncoated particles. As the particulates collide within the mill they are reduced in size and comminuted and an amount of coating is transferred from the coated particulates to the uncoated ones such that they become sufficiently coated.

In an alternative embodiment of the present invention relatively large uncoated particulates are introduced into the fluid energy mill along with smaller uncoated particulates. During the milling operation a coating material is introduced which coats the particulates. Subsequent polymerization and or curing of the coating overlying the particulates may be initiated or catalyzed through the effect of a wide variety of known mechanisms including but not limited to ultraviolet radiation heat and time dependent curing.

Although the types of fluid energy and or jet mills employed are well known and readily available their particular utility for simultaneously producing ultra fine coated particles and in particular ultra fine coated energetic compositions was not previously recognized. Furthermore and due in part to the extreme difficulty to produce atomized coating materials in sizes smaller than ten 10 microns consistently coating particles of that small size was equally difficult. Finally coating particles on the order of one 1 micron in size prior to the present invention was unknown.

The following merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which although not explicitly described or shown herein embody the principles of the invention and are included within its spirit and scope.

Furthermore all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor s to furthering the art and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.

Moreover all statements herein reciting principles aspects and embodiments of the invention as well as specific examples thereof are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future i.e. any elements developed that perform the same function regardless of structure.

Thus for example it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative structures embodying the principles of the invention.

The mill illustrated in is representative of a commercially available MICRONIZER mill manufactured by Sturtevant Inc. Hanover Mass. Operationally particulate material is introduced via feed funnel and subsequently directed into grinding chamber through the effect of compressed feed air applied to feed air gas inlet . Compressed grind air or gas applied to grind air gas manifold causes the introduced particulates to rotate about the grinding chamber. The rotational particulate flow generates high speed collisions creating increasing smaller particulates as a result of the particulate on particulate and particulate to wall impacts.

While not specifically shown in the illustration of such a mill will normally have a number of feed inlets spaced around the periphery of the grinding chamber . Similarly a series of air jets which are supplied with air by the air manifold are also spaced around the periphery of the grinding chamber. The air jets cause entering particulates to move in high speed rotation so that they violently impact each other and with the wall.

As a further result of the rotation larger particulates due to centrifugal forces are kept at the periphery of the grinding chamber where most of the grinding occurs. Smaller particulates due to centripetal forces are driven toward the center of the grinding chamber where a centrally located outlet permits their discharge.

As can be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art mills such as that shown in are relatively simple and generally contain no moving parts. In addition they provide an efficient one step grinding and classifying operation which advantageously lends itself to the present invention.

As noted one particularly important application for the present invention is the preparation of energetic materials such as the high explosive composition RDX coated with one or more of a variety of coating materials. By way of example only the types of coating materials may be broadly categorized as follows.

Monomeric and Pre Polymeric Coating Materials including heat curable compositions UV curable compositions as well as smooth coat monomers and pre polymer solutions.

As will become apparent to those skilled in the art the present method is advantageously compatible with these enumerated coating materials and others and accommodates the nearly instantaneous curing of applied coatings via ultra violet UV mechanisms or longer cure times associated with solvent flash off or chemically induced polymerization.

While in the grinding chamber the flow induced centrifugal forces assist the transfer of coating material from the larger pre coated particulates to the smaller uncoated ones as the particulates undergo milling and the resultant size reduction in size. Advantageously the present method may produce coated particulates 

Of further advantage while we have described this exemplary process using both coated and uncoated particulates the present method will operate if only coated particulates are provided to feed funnel . In either case as the pre coated particulates are circulated within the FEM they collide with the chamber walls and other pre coated particulates and smaller uncoated ones. During the collisions between the pre coated and uncoated particulates some of the coating material is transferred to or adsorbed by the uncoated particulates thereby coating the uncoated particulates while simultaneously reducing the particulate size to that desired.

Once desired particulate size s are so produced they are urged to the central region of the grinding chamber and discharged to a collector for storage and subsequent dispensation.

As can now be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art the present invention advantageously employs the relatively high inherent kinetic energy associated with the milling process to transfer the coating material from the larger coated particulates to smaller uncoated ones. Of particular significance the coating does not agglomerate during the coating transfer. For particular groups of coating materials the frequent violent particulate collisions which occur during milling within the FEM facilitates the transfer of the coating materials from the coated surfaces to any fresh surfaces resulting from particulate attrition.

From these examples those skilled into the art will readily appreciate that the present invention may continuously produce coated particulates of a desired size without further processing or re work other than packaging for storage transport .

An additional example of the present method is shown in . Shown therein are relatively large uncoated particulates 20 200 microns fed into FEM input funnel . As with the earlier examples the particulates so introduced into the FEM are milled to a desired size.

As the properly sized particles are discharged from the FEM they are directed to a collector via transfer duct wherein they are sprayed with a desired coating material finely atomized into the particle stream flowing through transfer duct from FEM discharge port to collector . Although the finely atomized coating droplets may be larger than the milled particulates comprising the flowing particle stream the milled particulates may be transferred through the duct at a sufficient high velocity to impart enough momentum to the particulates such that they penetrate the droplet s and become coated. The coated particulates may then flow through a portion of the transfer duct wherein the coating may be cured on the surface of the particulates.

As before any of a number of mechanisms may be employed i.e. UV irradiation to promote the cure of the coating during the transfer to the collector . It should be noted that while we have used the term cure to describe the permanent affixation of the coating to the particulates it is understood that such cure may include polymerization solvent flash off catalysis or other known mechanisms

Finally and as can be appreciated this exemplary embodiment of the present invention uses the velocity of the flowing particulates to penetrate the atomized coating droplets thereby transferring the coating to the surface of the particulates.

Of course it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and that various modifications can be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. In particular different FEM configurations may be employed or configurations wherein high velocity jets of particulates are directed directly at one another to produce collisions of sufficient energy to impart a size reduction and coating. Additionally the coatings may advantageously be applied dry as liquids or some combination as directed by the particular application. Furthermore the applied coatings may advantageously be a mixture of various individual coatings in a variety of proportions. Finally the particular particulates used may also be a mixture of various individual particulate types in any desired proportion. For example a mixture of various particulate energetic materials such as HDX RDX etc. As can be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art the invention of the present application may simultaneously mill and coat a mixture of particulates depending upon the desired final end product. Accordingly our invention is to be limited only by the scope of the claims attached hereto.
