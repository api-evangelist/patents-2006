This invention relates to prevention of tampering of signs number plates and the like in which retroreflective sheeting is used by means of revealing a virtual image on the reflective sheeting utilizing visual illusion and making use of the virtual image.

Specifically the invention relates to retroreflective sheeting characterized by at least comprising a printed image incorporated retroreflective sheeting and an optical element array sheet in which a large number of light transmissive optical elements are regularly disposed at least at a fixed location so that when the printed image is seen through the optical element array sheet a variable image which varies according to the relative position of the optical element array sheet to the retroreflective sheeting is formed or to retroreflective sheeting in which the optical element array sheet is laminated on the retroreflective sheeting to produce a variable image which varies according to the relative position of the optical element array sheet to the retroreflective sheeting.

More specifically the invention relates to a printed image incorporated retroreflective sheeting which is characterized in that the printed image comprises at least one kind of latent image and a lenticular lens sheet is used as the optical element array sheet the latent image incorporated in the retroreflective sheeting being a pattern halftone printed based on the plate which is made by resolution of the image to be used for formation of a stereoscopic image at the same pitch with the lens pitch of the lenticular lens.

Also as another embodiment the invention relates to a printed image incorporated retroreflective sheeting which uses a convex lens array sheet as the optical element array sheet and in which the pattern incorporated therein is given by halftone printing the line number c in the halftone printed part and the line number d of the convex lens array sheet having the relationship defined by

Patent Reference 1 discloses a stereoscopic variable image printed jigsaw puzzle which is characterized in that the jigsaw puzzle pieces are made of 0.2 3.0 mm thick lenticular lens having a lens pitch of 20 150 lines inch and the beads are set in a surface of a board case on which a pattern whose image is resolved at the same pitch to the lens pitch of said lenticular lens is formed to configure the stereoscopic variable image and a method for making the same.

JP 2004 329355A Patent Reference 1 also discloses a stereoscopic variable print jigsaw puzzle in which each jigsaw puzzle piece is formed of a dot lens sheet and the pieces are set in a surface of a board case in which a pattern comprising a halftone printed portion is formed to configure a stereoscopic variable image characterized in that the line number m of the halftone printed portion and the line number n of the dot lens sheet satisfy the following relationship 50 150 3 2 and a method for making the same.

However this Patent Reference 1 lacks a disclosure concerning provision of a stereoscopic image in a retroreflective sheeting which retroreflects light. The jigsaw puzzle of Patent Reference 2 is said to have high visual effect and design quality giving a feeling of achievement and satisfaction of having completed the puzzle and increased entertainability. The Reference also states that the jigsaw puzzle pieces as combined show high decorative effect. The use of its virtual image for tamper prevention however is not disclosed.

Patent Reference 2 however does not contain any disclosure relating to setting up stereoscopic images in retroreflective sheeting which retroreflects light. Although it states that the decoration of Patent Reference 2 is interesting to watch and hence can be utilized for display plates or printed matters it is silent on use of the virtual images for tamper prevention.

Conventionally retroreflective sheeting which reflects incident light toward the light source is well known. The retroreflective sheeting has been widely utilized in the fields making use of its retroreflectivity such as of signs including road signs and construction signs number plates on vehicles such as automobiles or motorcycles safety goods such as clothing and life preservers marking on signboards various types of certification stickers or reflective plates and the like. In particular adoption of retroreflective sheeting for various kinds of number plates or certification stickers is increasing in these years.

As such reflective sheeting total internal reflection type cube corner retroreflective sheeting specular reflection type cube corner retroreflecive sheeting encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting enclosed lens type retroreflective sheeting and open lens type retroreflective sheeting are well known.

These patents on retroreflective sheetings however contain no description relating to incorporation of printed image in retroreflective sheeting or to the use of whereby obtained stereoscopic image for tamper prevention.

We have diligently engaged in the research for incorporating in retroreflective sheeting which retroreflects light stereoscopic image and using the stereoscopic image for tamper prevention.

As the result of our studies and development we discovered stereoscopic image could be incorporated in retroreflective sheeting by joining a light transmissive optical element array sheet with retroreflective sheeting in which a latent image formed of specific halftone printing conforming to the optical element array sheet is provided. Our further research completed the present invention.

Accordingly therefore the present invention provides a printed image incorporated retroreflective sheeting which is characterized in that a lenticular lens sheet is used as the optical element array sheet and that the latent image incorporated in the retroreflective sheeting is a pattern printed based on a plate made by image resolution of the original for the stereoscopic image at the line number same as the lens pitch for the lenticular lens.

According to the present invention furthermore a printed image incorporated retroreflective sheeting is provided which is characterized in that a convex lens array sheet is used as the optical element array sheet and in which the latent image incorporated in the retroreflective sheeting is formed by halftone printing the line number c in the halftone printed part and the line number d of the convex lens array sheet having the relationship defined by

When the printed image incorporated retroreflective sheeting is in normal state i.e. when the optical element array sheet is not laminated thereon the latent image is visible like ordinary print and hence it is difficult to tamper the latent image. In consequence tampering of the retroreflecive sheeting having such a latent image or tampering of for example number plates for vehicles or certification stickers using such retroreflective sheeting becomes difficult. Thus tamper prevention effect can be achieved.

As the retroreflecitve sheeting to be used in the present invention those known can be utilized i.e. total internal reflection type cube corner retroreflective sheeting specular reflection type cube corner retroreflective sheeting encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting enclosed lens type retroreflective sheeting open lens type retroreflective sheeting and the like can be conveniently used.

Encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting is described for example in JP Sho 40 1965 007870B to McKenzie Patent Reference 7 corres. to U.S. Pat. No. 3 190 178 JP Sho 52 1977 110592A to McGrath Patent Reference 8 corres. to U.S. Pat. No. 4 025 159 and JP Sho 62 1987 121043A to Bailey et al. Patent Reference 9 corres. to U.S. Pat. No. 5 064 272 and such retroreflective sheeting as described therein can be conveniently used in the present invention. As for the details of those sheetings refer to those references.

Enclosed lens type retroreflective sheeting is described for example in JP Sho 59 1984 071848A to Belisle Patent Reference 10 corres. to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 721 694 and 4 725 494 and such retroreflective sheetings as described therein can be conveniently used in the present invention. As for the details of the sheetings refer to the named references.

Lenticular lens to be used in the present invention is not particularly limited by its production method so long as it has the thickness ranging 0.2 3.0 mm and a lens pitch of 20 150 lines inch. It can be prepared by press working or printing.

When lenticular lens is made by press working such as embossing it is satisfactory that the product has a thickness allowing changes in relative positional relationship between its surface projections and the printed image provided in the retroreflective sheeting. Preferred thickness ranges 0.2 3.0 mm.

As the material for making the lens it can be any that is light transmitting and transparent for example general purpose synthetic resin sheet such as of polyethylene polypropylene polyester nylon urethane polyvinyl chloride and acryl. In respect of weatherability acrylic sheet is preferred and in consideration of pliability soft vinyl chloride sheet is preferred.

Lenticular lens sheet conveniently used in the present invention can be obtained by press working such a synthetic resin sheet with for example emboss rolls.

When the lenticular lens sheet is prepared by printing preferably a regularly uneven pattern is configured by silk screen printing at a pitch of 20 150 lines inch the depressions each having 1 50 m wide level portion.

As transparent sheet material to be used in that occasion sheet of polyvinyl chloride polycarbonate polyester acrylic resin polystyrene polypropylene polyethylene ABS resin biodecomposable resin and the like transparent or semi transparent synthetic paper are preferred.

Regularly uneven pattern is for forming a lenticular lens layer on the surface of such a transparent sheet material as above. While the convex portions are ordinary convex circular arcs the depressed portions are formed to have each a 1 50 m wide level portion at the base. Formation of such level portions renders the pattern sharp cut and drastically reduces shear haze blur and the like achieving excellent decorative effect.

The ink to be used for silk screening is not critical so long as it is highly transparent and can form an uneven pattern without other working such as embossing. For example braille ink or the like can be conveniently used. As commercially available good UV POT 50209 Braille Clear manufactured by Teikoku Ink Co. Ltd. can be named.

Computer soft programs for resolving the original of stereoscopic images at the same line number to the lens pitch of lenticular lens sheet are available on the market which can be used for the plate making. Printing at the dot density of 150 700 lines inch is preferred which can be carried out by direct printing e.g. printing with an aleophilic ink UW offset printing silk printing photogravure printing flexo printing and the like by such means as on demand printing or by transferring the original from advancedly printed transfer paper or the like using any of the earlier named printing methods.

It is also possible to form partially emphasized patterns by controlling either the convex lens pattern of the convex lens array sheet to the halftone printed portion or controlling the halftone dots in the halftone printed portion of the pattern to the convex lens pattern of the convex lens array sheet. In particular it is easier to control the halftone dots forming the pattern to the convex lens pattern and therefore preferred.

The pattern comprising the halftone printed portion may be monochrome solid in appearance but when it is formed by combination of parts of partially different halftone dot density and joined with a convex lens array sheet the halftone dots of partially different sizes can produce stereoscopic sense.

Suitable selection of coloring relations between the halftone dots and the background can give an effect as if a hidden pattern were revealed.

Furthermore where a pattern is generated by color process printing of at least two colors and at least one of the colors is provided by halftone printing e.g. where three colors out of five color process printing are halftone printed and the remaining colors ordinarily solid printed and the pattern is joined to a convex lens array sheet the solid printed portion constituting the two colored pattern appears flat while the halftone printed portion constituting the three colored pattern develops a stereoscopic image having a certain depth.

According to the invention the line number c in the halftone printed portion and the line number d of the convex lens array sheet have the relationship defined by

c B d B being a positive numerical value within a range of 0.5 to 1.5. When the c is not equal to the d a stereoscopic image is developed. Outside the above range stereoscopic image fails to develop or become very dull and blurred providing no visually interesting image.

According to the invention even when the c equals the d still stereoscopic images can be developed by joining the arraying pattern of the convex lens array sheet with the arraying pattern of the halftone printing at their crossing angles adjusted to 0 

According to the invention stereoscopic images can be obtained when the optical element array sheet is joined with the printed image in the retroreflective sheeting in either manner that the optical elements in the optical element array sheet face upward or downward.

Hereinafter the retroreflective sheeting of the present invention is explained in further details. As the printed image incorporated retroreflective sheeting of the present invention any of total internal reflection type cube corner retroreflective sheeting specular reflection type cube corner retroreflective sheeting encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting enclosed lens type retroreflective sheeting open lens type retroreflective sheeting and the like can be used.

In explaining the present invention in details hereafter first a triangular pyramidal cube corner retroreflective sheeting which is a typical embodiment of total internal reflection type cube corner retroreflective sheeting shall be explained referring to the appended drawing.

 is a retororeflective element layer in which triangular pyramidal reflective elements are disposed at the closest packed state 

 indicates the direction of entering light. Usually the retororeflective element layer and the holding layer are integrated but different layers may be laminated. According to the purpose of use of the retroreflective sheeting of the present invention and environments in which the sheeting is used a surface protective layer printed layer binder layer for providing an airtightly sealed structure for preventing infiltration of water into the back of the reflective layer a support layer for supporting the binder layer and an adhesive layer and removable layer for adhering the retroreflective sheeting to other structure can be provided.

The printed layer can be normally disposed between the surface protective layer and the holding layer or on the surface protective layer or on the reflective plane of the retororeflective element layer . Where the surface protective layer is formed of two or more layers the printed layer may be interposed between any two layers of the surface protective layer.

The latent image may be formed in the same layer with the printed layer or in a layer different from the printed layer where plural layers form the printed layer. It is preferred to form it on the front surface or back of the surface protective layer the light entering side is referred to as the front surface for obtaining clearer stereoscopic image. From the standpoint of security its provision on the back of the surface protective layer is more preferred.

The printed layer can normally be provided by such means as gravuer printing screen printing offset printing flexo printing inkjet printing or laser printing.

The material to constitute the retororeflective element layer and holding layer is not critical as long as it satisfies the flexibility requirement which is one of the objects of the present invention while it preferably is optically transparent and is homogeneous.

Examples of the material useful for the retororeflective element layer according to the present invention include polycarbonate resin polyvinyl chloride resin meth acrylic resin epoxy resin styrene resin polyester resin fluorinated resin olefin resin such as polyethylene resin or polypropylene resin cellulose resin and urethane resin. For improving weatherability ultraviolet absorber light stabilizer antioxidant and the like may be incorporated either alone or in combination. Furthermore as coloring agent various organic pigment inorganic pigment fluorescent pigment dye fluorescent dye and the like may be added.

The same resin used for the retororeflective element layer can be used for the surface protective layer polyvinyl chloride resin and meth acrylic resin which excel in weatherability solvent resistance and printability being particularly preferred.

For also the surface protective layer ultraviolet absorber light stabilizer antioxidant and the like can be incorporated either alone or in combination for improving weatherablity. Also as coloring agent various organic pigment inorganic pigment fluorescent pigment dye fluorescent dye and the like can be added.

Preferably the surface tension of the surface protective layer is adjusted to at least 32 dyne cm for imparting favorable printing characteristics when the surface protective layer is to be printed. Printing ink for the surface protective layer may contain besides a resin component and coloring agent various additives such as plasticizer defoaming agent leveling agent ultraviolet absorber light stabilizer heat stabilizer crosslinking agent and the like and also may be blended with solvent for adjusting viscosity.

The resin component to be used in the ink is not particularly limited while those excelling in dispersibility and stability of coloring agent solubility in solvent weatherability printability and intimate adherability to film such as melamine resin epoxy resin urethane resin vinyl resin polyester resin alkyd resin and the like are preferred which can be used either alone or two or more of them can be combined and copolymerized.

It is a general practice to provide an air layer at the back of the triangular pyramidal cube corner retroreflective elements for enlarging the critical angle satisfying the total internal reflection conditions for the retororeflective element layer . With the view to prevent such troubles as reduction in critical angle due to moisture infiltration under the conditions of actual use preferably the retororeflective element layer and the support layer are airtightly sealed together by a binder layer .

As the means for the sealing those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 190 178 and 4 025 159 JP Utility Model Sho 50 1975 28669A and the like can be used.

As the resin to be used for the binder layer meth acrylic resin polyester resin alkyd resin epoxy resin and the like can be named and as the means for binding known thermofusing resin binding method thermosetting resin binding method ultraviolet ray hardenable resin binding method electron hardenable resin binding method and the like can be suitably used.

The binder layer used in the present invention may be applied over the whole surface of the support layer or can be selectively disposed at joint portions with the retroreflective element layer by such means as printing.

Examples of the material for making the support layer include the resins useful for making the retroreflective element layer film forming resin in general fiber cloth foil or plate of such metals as stainless steel aluminum and the like which can be used either alone or as combined.

The adhesive layer used for sticking the retroreflective sheeting of the present invention to metal sheet wooden plate glass sheet plastic sheet or the like and the removable layer for protecting the adhesive layer can be suitably selected from those known materials. As the adhesive pressure sensitive adhesive heat sensitive adhesive crosslinking type adhesive and the like can be suitably used. As pressure sensitive adhesive polyacrylic acid ester tackifier obtained by copolymerization of acrylic acid ester such as butyl acrylate 2 ethylhexyl acrylate isooctyl acrylate nonyl acrylate or the like with acrylic acid vinyl acetate or the like silicone resin tackifier rubber tackifier and the like can be used. As heat sensitive adhesive acrylic polyester or epoxy resin can be used.

An example of specular reflection type cube corner retroreflective sheeting which is another preferred embodiment of cube corner type retroreflective sheeting of the present invention is explained in the next referring to its cross sectional view.

The same materials as described as to above triangular pyramidal cube corner retroreflective sheeting can be used for the surface protective layer printed layer holding layer retororeflective element layer integrated layer of and adhesive layer and removable layer of the specular reflection type triangular pyramidal cube corner retroreflective sheeting as illustrated in .

Because a metallic specular reflective layer is provided on the retororeflective element layer in this embodiment the printed layer and latent image are preferably provided on the front surface or back of the surface layer for better visibility of the pattern.

The latent image may be formed on the same layer with the printed layer or in a different layer where the printed layer is composed of plural layers. It is preferably formed however on the front or back the light entering side is referred to as the front of the surface protective layer for obtaining more distinct stereoscopic image. From the viewpoint of security it is still better to form the latent image on the back of the surface protective layer.

The printed layer can be formed by those printing methods useful with above triangular pyramidal retroreflective sheeting by such means as gravure printing screen printing offset printing flexo printing inkjet printing and laser printing.

For the halftone printing for developing the latent image those printing methods useful with the triangular pyramidal retroreflective sheeting can be adopted by such means as gravure printing screen printing offset printing flexo printing inkjet printing and laser printing.

In the occasion of printing on the surface protective layer preferably the surface tension of the layer is adjusted to be at least 32 dyne cm for improving its printing characteristics. The ink for the printed layer may contain various additives other than a resin component and coloring agent such as plasticizer defoamer leveling agent ultraviolet absorber light stabilizer heat stabilizer crosslinking agent and the like where necessary. Solvent may be blended for adjusting viscosity.

The resin component to be used for the ink is subject to no particular limitation while melamine resin epoxy resin urethane resin vinyl resin polyester resin alkyd resin and the like are preferred for their good dispersibility and stability of coloring agent is therein solubility in solvent weatherability printability and intimate adherability to film. These resins can be used either alone or as copolymer of two or more thereof.

On the surfaces of the elements in the retororeflective element layer of the specular reflection type cube corner retroreflective sheeting a metallic specular reflective layer is mounted and further an adhesive layer is laminated in direct contact with the specular reflective layer . The specular reflection type triangular pyramidal cube corner retroreflective sheeting of this embodiment retroreflects based on the principle of specular reflection and does not require an air layer and hence does not require a binder layer and support layer.

In the specular reflection type cube corner retroreflective sheeting of the present invention a specular reflective layer made of metal such as aluminum copper silver nickel or the like can be provided on the surface of the retororeflective element layer by such means as vacuum vapor deposition chemical plating sputtering or the like. Of those methods for forming the specular reflective layer vacuum vapor deposition of aluminum is preferred because it can lower the vapor deposition temperature and hence can minimize thermal deformation of the retroreflective element layer in the vapor deposition step and brighten the color tone of resulting specular reflective layer .

A continuous vapor deposition apparatus for the aluminum specular reflective layer is composed of a vacuum container capable of maintaining the degree of vacuum at around 7 10 9 10mmHg and as installed therein an unwinder to draw out an original prismatic sheet composed of two layers of a substrate sheet and a surface protective sheet laminated on the former s light entering side surface a reel to take up the vapor deposited original prismatic sheet and a heater installed therebetween which is capable of fusing aluminum with an electric heater in a graphite crucible. Pure aluminum pellets having a purity of at least 99.99 wt are fed into the graphite crucible and the apparatus can carry out the vapor deposition treatment under the conditions of for example at an AC voltage of 350 360 V electric current of 115 120A and the processing rate of 30 70 m min. vapor depositing fused and vaporized aluminum atoms on the surfaces of the retroreflective elements to provide a specular reflective layer of e.g. 800 2 000 in thickness.

In a large number of retroreflective elements which are microlens type reflective elements provided by fine glass beads partially carrying a specular reflective layer are disposed in approximately the closest packed state and a retroreflective element layer is formed by embedding the fine glass beads in the binder layer burying their specular reflective layer side so as to be supported by the binder layer. This retroreflective element layer contains an air layer which is sealed in capsules formed by the retroreflective elements binder layer surface protective layer and bonds which bind these layers as a continuous network.

The encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting can exhibit retroreflectivity only when it holds an air layer on the surfaces of the reflective elements as above. The bonds support the air layer and at the same time prevent infiltration of e.g. water onto the surface of the retroreflective element layer. When the retororeflective element layer surface is covered with e.g. water light entering into the retroreflective elements cannot focus on the specular reflective layer on the elements due to thereby changed refractive index and retroreflectivity of the sheeting is impaired.

The capsules in such an encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting which comprise the retroreflective elements and the retororeflective element layer and the air layer are generally formed as follows 

 a disperse fine glass beads onto a temporary support sheet having on its surface a thermoplastic layer such as of polyethylene to the maximum possible uniformity and embed the lower parts of the fine beads in the thermoplastic layer by heating 

 b lead the fine glass beads embedded temporary support sheet as obtained in a above to vaporized metal depositing apparatus to vapor deposit a metallic layer specular reflective layer on the exposed surfaces of the fine glass beads 

 c hot press on the sheet as obtained in b above in which the fine glass beads carrying the specular reflective layer on their exposed surfaces are embedded a thermoplastic resin sheet to serve as a binder layer or where necessary the thermoplastic resin side of a laminate formed of the thermoplastic resin with a supporting resin sheet to serve as a support layer to bury the specular reflective layer portion of the fine glass beads into the thermoplastic resin layer and peel the temporary support sheet off to transfer the specular reflective layer carrying fine glass beads to the thermoplastic resin layer 

 d lay on the fine glass beads side of the sheet as obtained in c above a resin sheet to serve as the surface protective layer then partially deform the binder layer by such means as heat embossing from the backside of the binder layer the opposite to the light entering side to thermofuse it with the surface protective layer and form the bonds or

 d print a reticular pattern to serve as the bonds with a suitable resin on the surface of fine glass bead side of the sheet as obtained in c above mount thereon and adhere thereto the surface protective layer to form the bonds therebetween 

 e whereby forming the capsules enclosed by the surface protective layer binder layer and bonds which encapsulate the retroreflective element layer and air layer .

The retroreflective sheeting can be further provided with printed layer s for transferring information to observers or coloring the sheeting a support layer for supporting and reinforcing the binder layer an adhesive layer to stick the retroreflective sheeting onto other structure a removable layer and the like according to individual utility and use environment of the sheeting.

According to this embodiment the printed layer and latent image can be incorporated on the front surface or back of the surface layer or on the binder layer. For improving visibility of the pattern they are preferably provided on the front surface or back of the surface layer.

The latent image may be formed on the same layer with the printed layer or in a different layer where the printed layer is composed of plural layers. It is preferably formed however on the front or back the light entering side is referred to as the front of the surface protective layer for obtaining more distinct stereoscopic image. From the viewpoint of security it is still better to form the latent image on the back of the surface protective layer.

The printed layer can be formed by those printing methods useful with above triangular pyramidal retroreflective sheeting by such means as gravure printing screen printing offset printing flexo printing inkjet printing and laser printing.

For the halftone print for developing the latent image those printing methods useful with the triangular pyramidal retroreflective sheeting can be adopted by such means as gravure printing screen printing offset printing flexo printing inkjet printing and laser printing.

In the occasion of printing on the surface protective layer preferably the surface tension of the layer is adjusted to be at least 32 dyne cm for improving its printing characteristics. The ink for the printed layer may contain various additives other than a resin component and coloring agent such as plasticizer defoamer leveling agent ultraviolet absorber light stabilizer heat stabilizer crosslinking agent and the like where necessary. Solvent may be blended for adjusting viscosity.

The resin component to be used for the ink is subject to no particular limitation while melamine resin epoxy resin urethane resin vinyl resin polyester resin alkyd resin and the like are preferred for their good dispersibility and stability of coloring agent therein solubility in solvent weatherability printability and intimate adherability to film. These resins can be used either alone or as copolymer of two or more thereof.

The fine glass beads which are used for making the retroreflective element layer are made of a glass of particularly high refractive index.

As the materials for composing each of the layers of this encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting those similar to the materials as earlier described as to each of the corresponding layers in the cube corner type retroreflective sheeting can be use.

Of these layers the support layer which is optionally provided where necessary is usually made of a resin which is stronger and more flexible than the material used for the binder layer and which can be crosslinked by any known means for example using isocyanate as a crosslinking agent or by radiation where necessary.

Also in the encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting of above described construction at least one of the layers closer to the light entering side the side indicated by the arrow in than the sealed air layer i.e. the surface protective layer and or the printed layer s as shown in may contain as blended therein an ultraviolet absorber and or light stabilizer similarly to those in cube corner retroreflective sheeting whereby providing an encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting excelling in weatherability.

Next an enclosed lens type retroreflective sheeting which is another embodiment of preferred construction of the present invention is explained referring to a cross sectional view of the embodiment.

As shown in the sheeting is composed of a surface layer made of a transparent resin which supports a large number of transparent fine beads having high refractive index such as transparent microglass beads as embedded therein a layer of the transparent fine beads which are embedded in the beads binding layer to approximately of their diameters and a focus adjusting layer which is formed along the curved surface of the layer of the transparent fine beads protruding from the beads binding layer and whose thickness is made constant so that the specular reflective layer formed thereon is positioned approximately coinciding with the optical force of the transparent fine beads . The transparent fine beads having the high refractive index the focus adjusting layer and the specular reflective layer are located at about the relative positions optically satisfying retroreflective conditions of light together constituting an enclosed lens type retroreflective element.

The printed layer and latent image in this embodiment can be provided on the front surface or back of the surface layer or on the binder layer. Preferably they are provided on the front surface or back of the surface layer for better visibility of the pattern.

The latent image may be formed on the same layer with the printed layer or in a different layer where the printed layer is composed of plural layers. It is preferably formed however on the front or back the light entering side is referred to as the front of the surface protective layer for obtaining more distinct stereoscopic image. From the viewpoint of security it is still better to form the latent image on the back of the surface protective layer.

The printed layer can be formed by those printing methods useful with above triangular pyramidal retroreflective sheeting by such means as gravure printing screen printing offset printing flexo printing inkjet printing and laser printing.

For the halftone print for developing the latent image those printing methods useful with the triangular pyramidal retroreflective sheeting can be adopted by such means as gravure printing screen printing offset printing flexo printing inkjet printing and laser printing.

In the occasion of printing on the surface protective layer preferably the surface tension of the layer is adjusted to be at least 32 dyne cm for improving its printing characteristics. The ink for the printed layer may contain various additives other than a resin component and coloring agent such as plasticizer defoamer leveling agent ultraviolet absorber light stabilizer heat stabilizer crosslinking agent and the like where necessary. Solvent may be blended for adjusting viscosity.

The resin component to be used for the ink is subject to no particular limitation while melamine resin epoxy resin urethane resin vinyl resin polyester resin alkyd resin and the like are preferred for their good dispersibility and stability of coloring agent therein solubility in solvent weatherability printability and intimate adherability to film. These resins can be used either alone or as copolymer of two or more thereof.

The printed image or latent image can be formed on the front surface the surface on the light entering side or back of the surface protective layer or on the surface of the retroreflective element layer similarly to the above described cube corner type retroreflective sheeting or encapsulated lens type retroreflective sheeting. Also similar coloring agent can be used.

As the materials for composing each of the layers of this enclosed lens type retroreflective sheeting those similar to the materials as earlier described as to each of the corresponding layers in the cube corner type retroreflective sheeting can be use.

Also in the enclosed lens type retroreflective sheeting the surface layer and the reflective layer may be blended with ultraviolet absorber and or light stabilizer similarly to above described cube corner type retroreflective sheeting whereby providing enclosed lens type retroreflective sheeting excelling in weatherability.

The retroreflective sheeting of the present invention is composed of a retroreflective sheeting bearing a printed image and an optical element array sheet in at least a fixed portion of which a large number of light transmissive optical elements are regularly disposed. The optical element array sheet and the retroreflective sheeting are separately present and the retroreoflective sheeting may be seen through the optical element array sheet or the optical element array sheet may be laminated on the retroreflective sheeting to vary the image by rotating or shifting the former s relative position to the retroreflective sheeting.

The retroreflective sheeting according to the present invention has a variable image which changes according to the relative positions of the optical element array sheet and the retroreflective sheeting. The variable image may be a planar two dimensional image or stereoscopic three dimensional image.
