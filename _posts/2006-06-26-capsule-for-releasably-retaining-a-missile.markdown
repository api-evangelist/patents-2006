title: Capsule for releasably retaining a missile
abstract: A capsule adapted for disposition in a submarine launch tube for retaining the missile until launch thereof. The capsule includes a cylindrically shaped housing including a plurality of layers of glass fibers and layers of graphite, the layers including an outer layer of glass fibers defining an outer skin of the housing, and an inner layer of glass fibers. A titanium flange is fixed on the housing and in contact with the layers of graphite. An adhesive layer is disposed on the outer skin and an interface support pad is mounted on the outer skin and retained thereon by the adhesive layer. A layer of metal foil is disposed inboard of the adhesive layer and between the outer layer of glass fibers and the inner layer of glass fibers, to serve as a barrier to products of galvanic reaction occurring between the graphite layers and the titanium flange.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefore.

The invention relates to containers for submarine launched missiles and more specifically to a capsule for releasably retaining a missile the capsule being adapted for disposition in a submarine launch tube and adapted to house the missile until launch thereof.

It is known to provide a capsule for retention of a missile the capsule being adapted for disposition in a submarine launch tube. The capsule wall is made up of a composite of layers of graphite and glass fiber bonded with an epoxy resin. The layers at their ends abut titanium flanges. Urethane pads are adhesively bound to the outermost layer of glass fibers which forms the outer skin of the capsule.

Experience has shown that contact between the graphite layers and the titanium flanges creates galvanic reaction within the composite wall. The reaction produces NaOH and or moisture and oxygen which leaches out of the composite and deteriorates the adhesive bond between the urethane pads and the composite capsule resulting in bond failures.

There is thus a need for a structure for preventing the NaOH and moisture and oxygen from contacting the adhesive layer binding the urethane pads to the capsule outer skin.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide an improved structure for the capsule composite wall which structure prevents internally generated products of galvanic reaction from reaching the adhesive bonding the methane pads to the capsule outer skin.

With the above and other objects in view a feature of the invention is the provision of a capsule for releasably retaining a missile the capsule being adapted for disposition in a submarine vertical launch tube and for retaining the missile until launch thereof. The capsule comprises a cylindrically shaped housing made of a plurality of layers of glass fibers and layers of graphite the layers including an outer layer of glass fibers defining an outer skin of the housing and an inner layer of glass fibers disposed inboard of the outer layer of glass fibers. A titanium flange is fixed on the housing proximate either end thereof and in contact with the layers of graphite. An adhesive layer is disposed on the outer skin and an interface support pad is mounted on the outer skin and retained thereon by the adhesive layer. A layer of metal foil is disposed inboard of the adhesive layer and between the outer layer of glass fibers and the inner layer of glass fibers to serve as a barrier to products of galvanic reaction occurring between the graphite layers and the titanium flange.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that a capsule comprises an elongated cylindrically shaped housing which is adapted for disposition in a submarine vertical launch tube or the like not shown . The capsule is adapted to house a missile not shown until the missile is launched from the capsule and the submarine launch tube. The capsule is configured to receive carry and support the launch of the missile.

Referring to it will be seen that a forward end of the capsule includes a forward flange portion which in turn includes an inner piece and an outer piece . Sandwiched between the forward flange portion inner and outer pieces is a forward end of a wall structure defining the housing . A forward end of the wall structure abuts the inner piece of the forward flange portion .

Similarly an after end of the capsule includes an after flange portion which abuts an after end of the wall structure .

Referring to it will be seen that the wall structure of the capsule includes multiple alternating layers of graphite sandwiched between an inside layer of moisture barrier material and an outer layer of glass fibers. A second layer of glass fibers underlies the outer layer . Additional layers not shown of glass fibers may be included in the composite. The graphite layers preferably comprise thin layers of graphite and thicker layers of graphite. The graphite and glass fiber layers are in combination with an epoxy matrix not shown . The moisture barrier preferably comprises a layer of aluminum bound by inner and outer layers of glass cloth .

At either end of the capsule there is provided a titanium flange the flanges being in contact with the graphite layers .

On the outer surface of the outer layer of glass fibers there is mounted an interface support pad bound to the outer surface by a layer of adhesive. It is the adhesive layer that is potentially deleteriously affected by NaOH and or moisture and or oxygen derived from galvanic activity at the interfaces of graphite layers and flanges .

In accordance with the invention a metal foil is disposed between the outer glass fiber layer and another glass fiber layer there beneath such as the layer . The metal foil underlies the adhesive and the interface support pad and blocks movement of deleterious matter from the composite to the adhesive layer .

The interface support pads abut the inside surfaces of a launch tube not shown . The pads when viewed axially along the capsule are of arcuate configuration such that a base thereof coincides with the surface configuration of the capsule and the outer surface thereof coincides with the internal curvature of the launch tube. Thus the support pads serve to maintain the capsule centered in the launch tube. One set of pads is disposed proximate a forward end of the capsule and a second set of pads is disposed nearer the after end of the capsule . Each set typically includes four equally spaced and equally sized pads arranged circumferentially around the capsule. The metal foil may comprise a discrete foil member underlying each pad or a belt of foil underlying all the pads of a set of pads wherein the metal foil is of arcuate configuration such that a base surface thereof coincides with the surface configuration of the capsule and the outer surface thereof coincides with the internal curvature of the launch tube.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
