title: System and method for managing knowledge
abstract: An intelligence system is provided that is comprised of several basic components: a system for converting incoming unstructured data into a well described normalized form supported by a dedicated ‘mining’ language tied intimately to a system ontology; a system for accessing and manipulating data held in memory or in persistent storage in its normalized binary form; an ‘ontology’ that represents and contains the items and fields necessary for the target system to perform its function; a memory system tied to the ontology; a memory management system for splitting incoming data into those portions to be directed to each container; a query system for querying each container to retrieve portions of composite objects; a UI to display and interact with data within the system; a memory system that forms collections of datums and enables manipulation and exchange of these collections both within the local machine as well as across the network.
