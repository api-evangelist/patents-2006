title: Device and method for separating parts of acoustic sensors
abstract: A device for separating opposed ceramic elements from a metal base member, the device including a rigid body shaped complementarily to an inside surface of the base member and receivable therein. Opposed wedge members are mounted are in the body wall. The body includes a threaded interior surface. A bolt is included for threaded engagement with the interior surface and has a conically-shaped end. Each wedge member is engageable with one of the ceramic elements, such that upon inserting of the body in the base member and threaded movement of the bolt inward to the body, the end of the bolt engages the wedge members to urge the wedge members outward through a body wall to engage the ceramic elements to urge the ceramic elements apart and to separate from the base member.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefor.

The invention relates to a device for separating ceramic assemblies of acoustic sensors from a mating metallic part and a method for effecting the separation.

Some naval surface vessels are equipped with acoustic sensors. The disassembly of the acoustic sensors frequently involves damage to ceramic and metallic parts which make up components of each sensor. Because in part of the mechanical structure of the sensors and because in part of marine growth thereon disassembly and repair thereof often proves destructive to the ceramic parts and mating metallic parts both of which are expensive to purchase or to fabricate.

Thus a need exists for a device which enables separation of the ceramic parts from the metallic part with little or no damage to such parts and for a method for effecting the separation.

A general purpose and primary object of the present invention is therefore to provide a device which separates mating ceramic and metallic parts of an acoustic sensor from each other with minimal or no damage inflicted on either.

A further object of the present invention is to provide a method for separating mating ceramic and metal parts of an acoustic sensor.

In order to attain the objects described the present invention provides a device for separating opposed ceramic elements from a metal base member. The device includes rigid body shaped complementarily to an interior surface of the base member and receivable therein.

The body includes opposed wedge members mounted in a wall of the body. The interior surface of the body is threaded and a bolt is included for threaded engagement with the interior surface of the body with the bolt having a generally conically shaped end.

Each of the wedge members is engageable with one of the ceramic elements such that upon insertion of the body in the base member and threaded movement of the bolt inwardly of the body the conically shaped end of the bolt engages the wedge members to urge the wedge members outward through side walls of the body thereby engaging the opposed ceramic elements to urge the ceramic elements apart and from the base member. This urging action separates the ceramic elements from the base member.

The present invention also provides a method for separating opposed ceramic elements from a metal base member. The method includes the steps of providing a device with a rigid body shaped complementarily to an inside surface of the base member and receivable therein opposed wedge members mounted in walls of the body an interior surface of the body being threaded a bolt for threaded engagement with the interior surface of the body and having a conically shaped end.

The body is inserted in the base member. The bolt is threadedly moved in the body with the conically shaped end of the bolt engaging the wedge members to urge the wedge members outward through side walls of the body.

The wedge members engage the opposed ceramic elements to urge the ceramic elements apart and from the base member thereby separating the ceramic elements from the base member.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts and method steps will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device and method embodying the invention are shown by way of illustration only and not as limitations of the invention. The principles and features of the invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring now to the drawings where like numerals reflect like parts throughout and depict a prior art acoustic sensor of the type with which the present invention is concerned. The prior art sensor generally comprises a metal base member having a central cylindrically shaped tubular metal member extending therethrough. The central member defines an interior surface having openings therein. Opposed ceramic elements are disposed in the openings in an interior surface wall .

Referring now to the present invention starting with it will be seen that the invention includes a device primarily for separating the opposed ceramic elements from the metal base member . The device primarily includes a cylindrically shaped rigid body preferably of carbon steel and shaped complimentarily to the interior surface . As will be described further opposed wedge members are mounted in a wall of the body See . An interior surface of the wall is provided with screw threads See .

The rigid body preferably is provided with a plate on one end thereof the plate being of a circular configuration and having a threaded orifice centrally thereof to be in alignment with the threaded interior surface See .

As shown in and the device further includes a threaded bolt having a head on one end thereof and preferably provided with straight sides for a mechanical mover not shown . The other end of the bolt is provided with a conically shaped tip .

The body inserts into the base member by sliding into the tubular member along the interior surface thereof with the wedge members aligned with and engaged with the ceramic elements of the acoustic sensor.

The wedge members are provided with surfaces See and that are complementary to surfaces of the ceramic elements . Each wedge member and is provided with a rib See and disposed in a notch in the wall See and so as to maintain proper orientation of the wedge members.

In order to separate the ceramic elements from the base member after the aforementioned insertion of the device in the tubular member the bolt is threadedly advanced as by a wrench or alternate mechanical mover known in the art through the threaded orifice and the threaded body interior surface See .

The tip of the bolt encounters the surfaces of the wedge members driving the wedge members radially outward in opposite directions from an axis of the rigid body See . The wedge members engage the ceramic elements and dislodge the ceramic elements from the base member See and . The head engages the plate to stop further inward movement of the bolt .

There is thus provided a device and method of use by which ceramic elements are separated from a metal base member with minimal or no damage to the base member and the ceramic elements.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials method steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
