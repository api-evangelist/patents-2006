The androgen receptor AR is a ligand activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens. Androgens are generally known as the male sex hormones. The androgenic hormones are steroids which are produced in the body by the testes and the cortex of the adrenal gland or can be synthesized in the laboratory. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic processes including the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass prostate growth spermatogenesis and the male hair pattern Matsumoto Endocrinol. Met. Clin. N. Am. 23 857 75 1994 . The endogenous steroidal androgens include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone DHT . Testosterone is the principal steroid secreted by the testes and is the primary circulating androgen found in the plasma of males. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha reductase in many peripheral tissues. DHT is thus thought to serve as the intracellular mediator for most androgen actions Zhou et al. Molec. Endocrinol. 9 208 18 1995 . Other steroidal androgens include esters of testosterone such as the cypionate propionate phenylpropionate cyclopentylpropionate isocarporate enanthate and decanoate esters and other synthetic androgens such as 7 Methyl Nortestosterone MENT and its acetate ester Sundaram et al. 7 Alpha Methyl Nortestosterone MENT The Optimal Androgen For Male Contraception Ann. Med. 25 199 205 1993 Sundaram . Because the AR is involved in male sexual development and function the AR is a likely target for effecting male contraception or other forms of hormone replacement therapy.

Worldwide population growth and social awareness of family planning have stimulated a great deal of research in contraception. Contraception is a difficult subject under any circumstance. It is fraught with cultural and social stigma religious implications and most certainly significant health concerns. This situation is only exacerbated when the subject focuses on male contraception. Despite the availability of suitable contraceptive devices historically society has looked to women to be responsible for contraceptive decisions and their consequences. Although concern over sexually transmitted diseases has made men more aware of the need to develop safe and responsible sexual habits women still often bear the brunt of contraceptive choice. Women have a number of choices from temporary mechanical devices such as sponges and diaphragms to temporary chemical devices such as spermicides. Women also have at their disposal more permanent options such as physical devices including IUDs and cervical caps as well as more permanent chemical treatments such as birth control pills and subcutaneous implants. However to date the only options available for men include the use of condoms and vasectomy. Condom use however is not favored by many men because of the reduced sexual sensitivity the interruption in sexual spontaneity and the significant possibility of pregnancy caused by breakage or misuse. Vasectomies are also not favored. If more convenient methods of birth control were available to men particularly long term methods which require no preparative activity immediately prior to a sexual act such methods could significantly increase the likelihood that men would take more responsibility for contraception.

Administration of the male sex steroids e.g. testosterone and its derivatives has shown particular promise in this regard due to the combined gonadotropin suppressing and androgen substituting properties of these compounds Steinberger et al. Effect of Chronic Administration of Testosterone Enanthate on Sperm Production and Plasma Testosterone Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone Levels A Preliminary Evaluation of a Possible Male Contraceptive Fertility and Sterility 28 1320 28 1977 . Chronic administration of high doses of testosterone completely abolishes sperm production azoospermia or reduces it to a very low level oligospermia . The degree of spermatogenic suppression necessary to produce infertility is not precisely known. However a recent report by the World Health Organization showed that weekly intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate result in azoospermia or severe oligospermia i.e. less than 3 million sperm per mil and infertility in 98 of men receiving therapy World Health Organization Task Force on Methods And Regulation of Male Fertility Contraceptive Efficacy of Testosterone Induced Azoospermia and Oligospermia in Normal Men Fertility and Sterility 65 821 29 1996 .

A variety of testosterone esters have been developed which are more slowly absorbed after intramuscular injection and thus result in greater androgenic effect. Testosterone enanthate is the most widely used of these esters. While testosterone enanthate has been valuable in terms of establishing the feasibility of hormonal agents for male contraception it has several drawbacks including the need for weekly injections and the presence of supraphysiologic peak levels of testosterone immediately following intramuscular injection Wu Effects of Testosterone Enanthate in Normal Men Experience From a Multicenter Contraceptive Efficacy Study Fertility and Sterility 65 626 36 1996 .

Bone mineral density BMD decreases with age in both males and females. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content BMC and BMD correlate with decreased bone strength and predispose patients to fracture.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S. the condition affects more than 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year including 500 000 spine 250 000 hip and 240 000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis with 5 20 of patients dying within one year and over 50 of survivors being incapacitated. The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase three fold over the next 60 years and one study estimated that there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050.

Women are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking alcohol abuse a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake. However osteoporosis also occurs frequently in males. It is well established that the bone mineral density of males decrease with age. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content and density correlates with decreased bone strength and predisposes to fracture. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of sex hormones in non reproductive tissues are only beginning to be understood but it is clear that physiologic concentrations of androgens and estrogens play an important role in maintaining bone homeostasis throughout the life cycle. Consequently when androgen or estrogen deprivation occurs there is a resultant increase in the rate of bone remodeling that tilts the balance of resorption and formation to the favor of resorption that contributes to the overall loss of bone mass. In males the natural decline in sex hormones at maturity direct decline in androgens as well as lower levels of estrogens derived from peripheral aromatization of androgens is associated with the frailty of bones. This effect is also observed in males who have been castrated.

Muscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement cardiac muscles which control the heart cardiomyopathics and smooth muscles. Chronic muscle wasting is a chronic condition i.e. persisting over a long period of time characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass weakening and degeneration of muscle.

The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by muscle protein degradation by catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation an unusually low rate of protein synthesis or a combination of both. Muscle protein catabolism whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting.

Muscle wasting is associated with chronic neurological genetic or infectious pathologies diseases illnesses or conditions. These include Muscular Dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy Muscle Atrophies such as Post Polio Muscle Atrophy PPMA Cachexias such as Cardiac Cachexia AIDS Cachexia and Cancer Cachexia malnutrition Leprosy Diabetes Renal Disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD Cancer end stage Renal failure Sarcopenia Emphysema Osteomalacia HIV Infection AIDS and Cardiomyopathy.

In addition other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include chronic lower back pain advanced age central nervous system CNS injury peripheral nerve injury spinal cord injury chemical injury central nervous system CNS damage peripheral nerve damage spinal cord damage chemical damage burns disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized long term hospitalization due to illness or injury and alcoholism.

An intact androgen receptor AR signaling pathway is crucial for appropriate development of skeletal muscles. Furthermore an intact AR signaling pathway increases lean muscle mass muscle strength and muscle protein synthesis.

Muscle wasting if left unabated can have dire health consequences. For example the changes that occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual s health resulting in increased susceptibility to infraction and poor performance status. In addition muscle wasting is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from cachexia and AIDS.

Selective androgen receptor modulators SARMs are in some embodiments androgen receptor targeting agents ARTA which are nonsteroidal ligands for the androgen receptor and may demonstrate tissue selective androgenic and or anabolic activity. These novel agents are useful in males for the treatment of a variety of hormone related conditions such as sexual dysfunction decreased sexual libido erectile dysfunction hypogonadism sarcopenia osteopenia osteoporosis alterations in cognition and mood depression anemia hair loss obesity benign prostate hyperplasia and or prostate cancer. Further SARMs are useful for oral testosterone replacement therapy and treating prostate cancer. In other embodiments the SARMs are useful for the treatment of a variety of hormone related conditions in females including sexual dysfunction decreased sexual libido hypogonadism sarcopenia osteopenia osteoporosis alterations in cognition and mood depression anemia hair loss obesity endometriosis infertility breast cancer uterine cancer and ovarian cancer.

In some embodiments the SARM compounds of this invention are useful in preventing and treating muscle wasting disorders and bone related disorders.

In some embodiments the SARM compounds stimulate cell signaling events via binding the androgen or other cell signaling receptors. In some embodiments receptors for extracellular signaling molecules are referred to as cell signaling receptors which are transmembrane proteins on a cell surface. The receptors may bind an extracellular signaling molecule i.e. a ligand and become activated so as to generate a cascade of intracellular signals that alter the behavior of the cell. In contrast in some cases the receptors are inside the cell and the signaling ligand has to enter the cell to activate them these signaling molecules therefore must be sufficiently small and hydrophobic to diffuse across the plasma membrane of the cell.

Steroid hormones are one example of small hydrophobic molecules that diffuse directly across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to intracellular cell signaling receptors. These receptors are structurally related and constitute the intracellular receptor superfamily or steroid hormone receptor superfamily . Steroid hormone receptors include progesterone receptors estrogen receptors androgen receptors glueocorticoid receptors and mineralocorticoid receptors. The present invention is particularly directed to androgen receptors.

A receptor agonist is a substance which binds receptors and activates them. A receptor partial agonist is a substance which binds receptor and partially activates them. A receptor antagonist is a substance which binds receptors and inactivates them. The SARM compounds of the present invention may in some embodiments have a tissue selective effect wherein for example a single agent is an agonist partial agonist and or antagonist depending on the tissue in which the receptor is expressed. For example the SARM compound may stimulate muscle tissue and concurrently inhibit prostate tissue. In one embodiment the SARMs which are useful in treating and preventing muscle wasting disorders are AR agonists and are therefore useful in binding to and activating the AR. In another embodiment the SARMs are AR antagonists and are therefore useful in binding to and inactivating the AR. Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.

In another embodiment the SARM compounds of the present invention can be classified as partial AR agonist antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues to cause increased transcription of AR responsive genes e.g. muscle anabolic effect . In other tissues these compounds serve as competitive inhibitors of testosterone DHT on the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens. The term SARM or SARM refers in one embodiment to a compound which modulates androgen receptor activity. In one embodiment the SARM is an agonist or in another embodiment an antagonist.

In one embodiment the SARM will have antagonist activity in a gonad of a subject and agonist activity peripherally such as for example in muscle. Such activity was demonstrated herein in terms of effects on prostate tissue versus that of levator ani muscle tissue as exemplified in or . In one embodiment the SARM compounds of the present invention bind reversibly or in another embodiment irreversibly to the androgen receptor. In one embodiment the SARM compounds bind reversibly to the androgen receptor. In another embodiment the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor. The compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group affinity label that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor i.e. covalent bond formation . Thus in this case the compounds bind irreversibly to the receptor and accordingly cannot be displaced by a steroid such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone.

Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.

In addition to ligand binding to the receptors the receptors can be blocked to prevent ligand binding. When a substance binds to a receptor the three dimensional structure of the substance fits into a space created by the three dimensional structure of the receptor in a ball and socket configuration. The better the ball fits into the socket the more tightly it is held. This phenomenon is called affinity. If the affinity of a substance is greater than the original hormone it will compete with the hormone and bind the binding site more frequently. Once bound signals may be sent through the receptor into the cells causing the cell to respond in some fashion. This is called activation. On activation the activated receptor then directly regulates the transcription of specific genes. But the substance and the receptor may have certain attributes other than affinity in order to activate the cell. Chemical bonds between atoms of the substance and the atoms of the receptors may form. In some cases this leads to a change in the configuration of the receptor which is enough to begin the activation process called signal transduction .

The compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or irreversibly to an androgen receptor. In one embodiment the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a mammal. In another embodiment the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a human. In one embodiment the SARM compounds bind reversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal for example a human. Reversible binding of a compound to a receptor means that a compound can detach from the receptor after binding.

In another embodiment the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal for example a human. Thus in one embodiment the compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group e.g. affinity label that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor i.e. covalent bond formation . Thus in this case the compounds are alkylating agents which bind irreversibly to the receptor and accordingly cannot be displaced by a steroid such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone. An alkylating agent is defined herein as an agent which alkylates forms a covalent bond with a cellular component such as DNA RNA or enzyme. It is a highly reactive chemical that introduces alkyl radicals into biologically active molecules and thereby prevents their proper functioning. The alkylating moiety is an electrophilic group that interacts with nucleophilic moieties in cellular components.

According to one embodiment of the present invention a method is provided for binding the SARM compounds of the present invention to an androgen receptor by contacting the receptor with a SARM compound and or its analog derivative isomer metabolite pharmaceutically acceptable salt pharmaceutical product polymorph crystal impurity hydrate N oxide or any combination thereof under conditions effective to cause the SARM compound to bind the androgen receptor. The binding of the SARM compounds to the androgen receptor enables the compounds of the present invention to be useful as a male contraceptive and in a number of hormone therapies. The agonist compounds bind to and activate the androgen receptor. The antagonist compounds bind to and inactivate the androgen receptor. Binding of the agonist or antagonist compounds is either reversible or irreversible.

The present invention also relates to a method of binding a SARM compound to an androgen receptor which includes contacting the androgen receptor with the SARM compound of this invention under conditions effective to bind the SARM compound to the androgen receptor.

The novel SARM compounds and the non steroidal agonist compounds of the present invention either alone or as a composition are useful in males and females for the treatment of a variety of hormone related conditions such as hypogonadism sarcopenia erythropoiesis erectile function lack of libido osteoporesis and fertility. Further the SARM compounds and the non steroidal agonist compounds are useful for oral testosterone replacement therapy treating prostate cancer imaging prostate cancer and maintaining sexual desire in women. The agents may be used alone or in combination with a progestin or estrogen.

In one embodiment modulation of the androgen receptor refers to the ability of the compound to stimulate or enhance signaling through the receptor and any or in another embodiment all downstream effects of receptor signal transduction.

In another embodiment a SARM of this invention may interact with a homologue of an androgen receptor. In one embodiment the term homologue of an androgen receptor refers to structurally or in another embodiment functionally related receptors whose regulation is desired. In one embodiment the SARMs of this invention may interact with estrogen receptors or in another embodiment other cell surface molecules which are involved in anabolic pathways or in another embodiment steroidogenic pathways or in another embodiment metabolic pathways.

The present invention further relates to a method of determining the presence of a selective androgen modulator compound and or a non steroidal agonist compound of the present invention in a sample. The method comprises the steps of obtaining the sample and detecting the compound in the sample thereby determining the presence of the compound in the sample.

In one embodiment the detection step comprises measuring the absorbance of the compound at a predetermined wavelength. For example the compounds of the present invention absorb in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum with an absorbency peak at 270 nm. Thus in one embodiment of the present invention the compound is detected by monitoring the UV absorbance of the sample at 270 nm. It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to UV absorption and that any other spectrometric methods of identification are applicable. For example compounds can be detected by measuring their infra red or visible absorbance.

In another embodiment the present invention further provides a method of determining the concentration of a SARM compound and or a non steroidal agonist compound of the present invention in a sample. The method comprises the steps of obtaining a sample determining the level of the compound in the sample and calculating the concentration of the compound in the sample by comparing the level with a standard sample containing a known concentration of the compound. Calibration curves of known concentrations of the compound in the sample can be obtained and the concentration of the compound in the test sample is calculated therefrom. By level it is meant the absorption level of the compound at the measured wavelength.

In another embodiment the compound is detected in the sample by contacting the sample with a binding protein which specifically binds to the compound and determining the amount of binding protein bound to the compound. The concentration of the compound can be determined by measuring the amount of binding protein bound to the compound and comparing that amount to a standard sample containing a known concentration of the compound binding protein complex.

Protein levels can be determined according to standard techniques as described in Sambrook et al. Briefly a sample obtained from a subject is contacted with a binding protein which specifically binds to a specific compound of the present invention and the amount of complex formed between the binding protein and the compound is determined. In one embodiment the binding protein is an antibody which specifically binds to one or more compounds of the present invention. In another embodiment the binding protein has a detectable label bound thereto and the complex between the binding protein label compound is determined by visualizing the complex

As defined herein contacting means that the binding protein is introduced into the sample in a test tube flask tissue culture chip array plate microplate capillary or the like and incubated at a temperature and time sufficient to permit the binding component to bind to a cell or a fraction thereof or plasma serum or a fraction thereof containing the target. Methods for contacting the samples with the binding proteins or other specific binding components are known to those skilled in the art and may be selected depending on the type of assay protocol to be run. Incubation methods are also standard and are known to those skilled in the art.

 Visualizing the complex may be carried out by any means known in the art including but not limited to ELISA radioimmunoassay flow cytometry dot blots western immunoblotting combined with gel electrophoresis immunohistochemistry at light and electron pe levels HPLC and mass spectrometry.

Either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies as well as any recombinant antibodies specific for the selective androgen modulator compounds or the non steroidal agonist compounds of the present invention can be used in the various immunoassays.

Coulter Corp. Hialeah Fla. phycocyanin allophycocyanin phycoerythrin cyanin dye 5 PECy5 Coulter label a phycocyanin label an allophycocyanin label an O phthaldehyde label a fluorescamine and Texas Red.

Examples of enzyme labels include alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase maleate dehydrogenase and peroxidase. Two principal types of enzyme immunoassay are the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA and the homogeneous enzyme immunoassay also known as enzyme multiplied immunoassay EMIT Syva Corporation Palo Alto Calif. . In the ELISA system separation may be achieved for example by the use of antibodies coupled to a solid phase. The EMIT system depends on deactivation of the enzyme in the tracer antibody complex the activity can thus be measured without the need for a separation step.

Particularly suitable labels include those which permit analysis by flow cytometry e.g. fluorochromes. Other suitable detectable labels include those useful in colorimetric enzyme systems e.g. horseradish peroxidase HRP and alkaline phosphatase AP . Other proximal enzyme systems are known to those of skill in the art including hexokinase in conjunction with glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase.

In addition the compositions may further comprise binders e.g. acacia cornstarch gelatin carbomer ethyl cellulose guar gum hydroxypropyl cellulose hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose povidone disintegrating agents e.g. cornstarch potato starch alginic acid silicon dioxide croscarmelose sodium crospovidone guar gum sodium starch glycolate buffers e.g. Tris HCl. acetate phosphate of various pH and ionic strength additives such as albumin or gelatin to prevent absorption to surfaces detergents e.g. Tween 20 Tween 80 Pluronic F68 bile acid salts protease inhibitors surfactants e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate permeation enhancers solubilizing agents e.g. cremophor glycerol polyethylene glycerol benzlkonium chloride benzyl benzoate cyclodextrins sobitan esters stearic acids anti oxidants e.g. ascorbic acid sodium metabisulfite butylated hydroxyanisole stabilizers e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose hyroxypropylmethyl cellulose viscosity increasing agents e.g. carbomer colloidal silicon dioxide ethyl cellulose guar gum sweetners e.g. aspartame citric acid preservatives e.g. Thimerosal benzyl alcohol parabens coloring agents lubricants e.g. stearic acid magnesium stearate polyethylene glycol sodium lauryl sulfate flow aids e.g. colloidal silicon dioxide plasticizers e.g. diethyl phthalate triethyl citrate emulsifiers e.g. carbomer hydroxypropyl cellulose sodium lauryl sulfate polymer coatings e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines coating and film forming agents e.g. ethyl cellulose acrylates polymethacrylates and or adjuvants.

In one embodiment the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are controlled release compositions i.e. compositions in which the SARM compound is released over a period of time after administration. Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots e.g. fatty acids waxes oils . In another embodiment the composition is an immediate release composition i.e. a composition in which all of the SARM compound is released immediately after administration.

In yet another embodiment the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. For example the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion an implantable osmotic pump a transdermal patch liposomes or other modes of administration. In one embodiment a pump may be used see Langer supra Sefton CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14 201 1987 Buchwald et al. Surgery 88 507 1980 Saudek et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 321 574 1989 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target i.e. the brain thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 . Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer Science 249 1527 1533 1990 .

The compositions may also include incorporation of the active material into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid polglycolic acid hydrogels etc or onto liposomes microemulsions micelles unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles erythrocyte ghosts or spheroplasts. Such compositions will influence the physical state solubility stability rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance.

Also comprehended by the invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines and the compound coupled to antibodies directed against tissue specific receptors ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue specific receptors.

Also comprehended by the invention are compounds modified by the covalent attachment of water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol carboxymethyl cellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline. The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds Abuchowski et al. 1981 Newmark et al. 1982 and Katre et al. 1987 . Such modifications may also increase the compound s solubility in aqueous solution eliminate aggregation enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.

For parenteral administration the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts esters N oxides and the like are converted into a solution suspension or emulsion if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose for example solubilizers or other.

An active component can be formulated into the composition as neutralized pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or antibody molecule which are formed with inorganic acids such as for example hydrochloric or phosphoric acids or such organic acids as acetic oxalic tartaric mandelic and the like. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as for example sodium potassium ammonium calcium or ferric hydroxides and such organic bases as isopropylamine trimethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine and the like.

For use in medicine the salts of the SARM will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may however be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may for example be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid sulphuric acid methanesulphonic acid fumaric acid maleic acid succinic acid acetic acid benzoic acid oxalic acid citric acid tartaric acid carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.

A muscle is a tissue of the body that primarily functions as a source of power. There are three types of muscles in the body a skeletal muscle the muscle responsible for moving extremities and external areas of the bodies b cardiac muscle the heart muscle and c smooth muscle the muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel.

A wasting condition or disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized at least in part by an abnormal progressive loss of body organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a result of a pathology such as for example cancer or an infection or it can be due to a physiologic or metabolic state such as disuse deconditioning that can occur for example due to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized such as in a cast. A wasting condition can also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be characterized by a loss of total body weight or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.

In one embodiment muscle wasting or muscular wasting used herein interchangeably refer to the progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement cardiac muscles which control the heart and smooth muscles. In one embodiment the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. Chronic muscle wasting is defined herein as the chronic i.e. persisting over a long period of time progressive loss of muscle mass and or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle.

The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation an unusually low rate of protein synthesis or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term catabolism has its commonly known meaning in the art specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.

Muscle wasting can occur as a result of a pathology disease condition or disorder. In one embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is chronic. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is genetic. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is neurological. In another embodiment the pathology illness disease or condition is infectious. As described herein the pathologies diseases conditions or disorders for which the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered are those that directly or indirectly produce a wasting i.e. loss of muscle mass that is a muscle wasting disorder.

In one embodiment muscle wasting in a subject is a result of the subject having a muscular dystrophie muscle atrophy X linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA cachexia malnutrition tuberculosis leprosy diabetes renal disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD cancer end stage renal failure sarcopenia emphysema osteomalacia or cardiomyopathy.

In another embodiment the muscle wasting disorder is due to infection with enterovirus Epstein Barr virus herpes zoster HIV trypanosomes influenze coxsackie rickettsia trichinella schistosoma or mycobacteria.

The muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal or voluntary muscles that control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy. The major forms of muscular dystrophy MD are duchenne muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy duchenne muscular dystrophy becker muscular dystrophy limb girdle muscular dystrophy facioscapulhumeral muscular dystrophy congenital muscular dystrophy oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy distal muscular dystrophy and emery dreifuss muscular dystrophy.

Muscular dystrophy can affect people of all ages. Although some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood others may not appear until middle age or later. Duchenne MD is the most common form typically affecting children. Myotonic dystrophy is the most common of these diseases in adults.

Muscle atrophy MA is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in muscle mass. For example Post Polio MA is a muscle wasting that occurs as part of the post polio syndrome PPS . The atrophy includes weakness muscle fatigue and pain.

Another type of MA is X linked spinal bulbar muscular atrophy SBMA also known as Kennedy s Disease . This disease arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome affects only males and its onset is in adulthood. Because the primary disease cause is an androgen receptor mutation androgen replacement is not a current therapeutic strategy. There are some investigational studies where exogenous testosterone propionate is being given to boost the levels of androgen with hopes of overcoming androgen insensitivity and perhaps provide an anabolic effect. Still use of supraphysiological levels of testosterone for supplementation will have limitations and other potentially serious complications.

Cachexia is weakness and a loss of weight caused by a disease or as a side effect of illness. Cardiac cachexia i.e. a muscle protein wasting of both the cardiac and skeletal muscle is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. Cancer cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is manifested by weight loss with massive depletion of both adipose tissue and lean muscle mass.

Cachexia is also seen in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS human immunodeficiency virus HIV associated myopathy and or muscle weakness wasting is a relatively common clinical manifestation of AIDS. Individuals with HIV associated myopathy or muscle weakness or wasting typically experience significant weight loss generalized or proximal muscle weakness tenderness and muscle atrophy.

Sarcopenia is a debilitating disease that afflicts the elderly and chronically ill patients and is characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. Further increased lean body mass is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for certain muscle wasting disorders. In addition other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting disorders. For example studies have shown that in severe cases of chronic lower back pain there is paraspinal muscle wasting.

Muscle wasting is also associated with advanced age. It is believed that general weakness in old age is due to muscle wasting. As the body ages an increasing proportion of skeletal muscle is replaced by fibrous tissue. The result is a significant reduction in muscle power performance and endurance.

Long term hospitalization due to illness or injury or disuse deconditioning that occurs for example when a limb is immobilized can also lead to muscle wasting. Studies have shown that in patients suffering injuries chronic illnesses burns trauma or cancer who are hospitalized for long periods of time there is a long lasting unilateral muscle wasting with a consequent decrease in body mass.

Injuries or damage to the central nervous system CNS are also associated with muscle wasting disorders. Injuries or damage to the CNS can be for example caused by diseases trauma or chemicals. Examples are central nerve injury or damage peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord injury or damage.

The following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention. They should in no way however be construed as limiting the broad scope of the invention.

A mixture comprising the compound of formula III DHT and PTH were prepared at concentrations ranging from 1 nM 1 M.

Four month old female rats were sacrificed by euthanasia and the femurs were excised from the animals. The femurs were cleaned off any muscle and connective tissues and were stored on ice in Minimum Essential Medium MEM with penicillin Streptomycin and Fungizone until the cells were cultured.

All cell culture materials were obtained from Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . The femurs were first rinsed in 70 ethanol and were washed three times with 5 ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Both the ends of the femurs were snapped and the bone marrow cells were flushed with 15 ml of MEM with penicillin Streptomycin and Fungizone into a 50 ml conical tube and stored on ice. The same procedure was performed with all the femurs. The bone marrow cells and were pooled were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min in a clinical centrifuge. The cells were resuspended in MEM without phenol red supplemented with 10 charcoal stripped serum penicillin streptomycin and fungizone. The cells were triturated through a 22 g needle counted under microscope and were plated at 1.5 million cells per well of a 6 well plate in MEM without phenol red supplemented with 15 charcoal stripped serum penicillin streptomycin 300 ng ml fungizone 0.28 mM Ascorbic acid and 10 mM glycerophosphate to differentiate towards fibroblast osteoblast lineage and at 2.5 million cells per well of a 24 well plate in MEM without phenol red supplemented with 10 charcoal stripped serum penicillin streptomycin and 300 ng ml fungizone to differentiate towards osteoclast lineage. The medium was changed on day 2 and the cells were treated with the indicated hormone. Osteoclast cultures were carried out in the presence of 50 ng RANK Ligand and 10 ng GM CSF to induce osteoclastogenesis. Medium was completely changed every third day for osteoclast cultures. For fibroblast cultures half the culture medium was changed every third day to leave the growth factors secreted by the cells.

At the end of 12 days the cells were fixed in 10 buffered formalin for fibroblast cultured and in 4 formaldehyde in PBS for osteoclast cultures. The fibroblasts were stained for alkaline phosphatase activity and the O.D. at 405 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer as described earlier. Osteoclasts were stained for Tartarate Resistant Acid Phosphatase Activity TRAP and cells having 2 or more nuclei were counted under the microscope and plotted as indicated earlier.

Androgens exert anabolic effects on bone and lack of androgens under conditions such as androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer and in old age have clearly indicated the benefits of androgens as a bone protective hormone. However the use of ectopic androgen is limited due to its side effects and also due to the risk of conversion of androgens to estrogens.

In order to determine whether a SARM could be therapeutic yet obviate the above side effects various SARMs were evaluated in terms of their ability to have bone protective effects with fewer side effects as seen with the parent hormone. The efficacy of dihydrotestosterone DHT and Parathyroid hormone PTH were compared to a SARM the compound of formula III in terms of their ability to differentiate primary rat bone marrow cells towards the osteoblast and the osteoclast lineage . Bone marrow cells from rats were cultured in the presence or absence of the above indicated hormones for 12 days in culture medium and were evaluated in terms of their differentiation towards osteoblast or osteoclast lineage.

DHT and the compound of formula III all increased differentiation of primary bone marrow cells toward the osteoblast lineage as measured by alkaline phosphatase ALP activity of the cells . At 1 M concentration DHT and the SARM induced the ALP activity comparably whereas at lower concentrations of 100 nM and 10 nM Compound III showed better induction than the DHT. PTH another bone anabolic hormone induced the ALP staining only at higher concentration but not at lower concentrations.

Sixty female virgin intact Sprague Dawley rats were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Wilmington Mass. and aged to 23 wks. The animals were housed 2 3 per cage and acclimated to a 12 h light dark cycle. Food 7012C L 485 Mouse Rat Sterilizable Diet Harlan Teklad Madison Wis. and water were provided ad libitum. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tennessee reviewed and approved the animal protocol for this study.

Sham surgeries or ovariectomies were performed on Day 0. The study was comprised of six treatment groups as follows 1 intact vehicle 2 intact COMPOUND III 3 OVX vehicle 4 OVX COMPOUND III 5 OVX alendronate 6 OVX alendronate COMPOUND III. Doses were administered daily via oral gavage in a vehicle of DMSO PEG300 10 90 beginning on Day 1. Animals were sacrificed on Day 45 of the study. Femurs were removed cleared of soft tissue and stored in saline soaked gauze at 20 C. until analysis. Nine animals died during the course of the study. These deaths were attributed to surgical complications arising from the ovariectomies and technical errors during oral dosing i.e. dosing solution delivered into the lungs . Dose groups are listed in Table 1.

The left femurs were sent to SkeleTech Inc. Bothell Wash. for biomechanical strength three point bending and pQCT analysis. A Stratec XCT RM and associated software Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH Pforzheim Germany. Software version 5.40 C were used for the pQCT analysis. The femur was analyzed at both the mid shaft and distal regions. The mid shaft analysis was performed on the region at 50 of the length of the femur. The distal analysis was performed on the region at 20 of the length of the femur starting at the distal end. One 0.5 mm slice perpendicular to the long axis of the femur was used for analysis. Total bone mineral content total bone area total bone mineral density cortical bone mineral content cortical bone area cortical bone mineral density cortical thickness periosteal perimeter circumference and endosteal perimeter were determined at the mid shaft of the femur. At the distal femur total bone mineral content total bone area total bone mineral density trabecular bone mineral content trabecular bone area and trabecular bone mineral density were determined. Following pQCT analysis the femoral strength was determined by a three point bending test. The anterior to posterior diameter APD unit mm at the midpoint of the femoral shaft was measured with an electronic caliper. The femur was placed on the lower supports of a three point bending fixture with the anterior side of the femur facing downward in an Instron Mechanical Testing Machine Instron 4465 retrofitted to 5500 Canton MA . The length L between the lower supports was set to 14 mm. The upper loading device was aligned to the center of the femoral shaft.

Male Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 200 g were purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science Indianapolis Ind. . The animals were maintained on a 12 h light dark cycle with food 7012C L 485 Mouse Rat Sterilizable Diet Harlan Teklad Madison Wis. and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tennessee. Anabolic and androgenic activity of Compound III in intact animals was evaluated and the dose response in acutely orchidectomized ORX animals was evaluated as well. Regenerative effects of Compound III in chronically 9 days ORX rats were also assessed.

The compound was weighed and dissolved in 10 DMSO Fisher diluted with PEG 300 Acros Organics NJ for preparation of the appropriate dosage concentrations. The animals were housed in groups of 2 to 3 animals per cage. Intact and ORX animals were randomly assigned to one of seven groups consisting of 4 to 5 animals per group. Control groups intact and ORX were administered vehicle daily. Compound III was administered via oral gavage at doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day to both intact and ORX groups.

Castrated animals on day one of the study were randomly assigned to dose groups 4 5 animals group of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day for dose response evaluation. Dosing began nine days post ORX and was administered daily via oral gavage for fourteen days. The animals were sacrificed under anesthesia ketamine xyalzine 87 13 mg kg after a 14 day dosing regimen and body weights were recorded. In addition ventral prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani muscle were removed individually weighed normalized to body weight and expressed as a percentage of intact control. Student s T test was used to compare individual dose groups to the intact control group. Significance was defined a priori as a P value 

Prostate weights following Compound III treatment were 111 21 88 15 77 17 71 16 71 10 and 87 13 of intact controls following doses of 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1 mg day respectively .

In ORX controls the levator ani muscle weight decreased to 55 7 of intact controls. We observed an anabolic effect in the levator ani muscle of Compound III treated animals. Compound III fully maintained levator ani muscle weights at doses 0.1 mg day. Doses 0.1 mg day resulted in significant increases in levator ani weight compared to that observed in intact controls. Levator ani muscle weights as a percentage of intact controls were 59 6 85 9 112 10 122 16 127 12 and 129.66 2 for the 0.01 0.03 0.1 0.3 0.75 and 1.0 mg day dose groups respectively. Results are graphically presented in . Eand EDvalues were determined in each tissue by nonlinear regression analysis in WinNonlin and presented in . Evalues were 83 25 85 11 and 131 2 for prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani respectively. The EDin prostate seminal vesicles and levator ani was 0.09 0.07 0.17 0.05 and 0.02 0.01 mg day respectively.

Serum LH and FSH data for the animals are presented in Table 2. LH decreased in a dose dependent manner in both intact and castrated animals. Following doses 0.1 mg day LH levels were below the limit of quantitation 0.07 ng mL . The 0.1 mg day dose in ORX animals returned LH levels back to those seen in intact controls. Similar effects were observed with FSH. In intact animals a significant decrease in FSH levels was observed with the 0.75 and 1 mg day doses. In ORX animals a dose dependent decrease in FSH levels was observed. Doses of Compound III 0.1 mg day in ORX animals returned FSH levels to those of intact controls.

Cohorts of a maximum of 12 healthy male volunteers were dosed at each dose level 9 active 3 placebo in a randomized double blind study design. Eight cohorts were recruited aged 18 45 years and each cohort received one single oral dose corresponding to either 1 3 10 30 or 100 mg compound III or placebo of equal volume of PEG300 in solution or 3 or 30 mg in experimental capsules. The effect of micronization i.e. particle size reduction was investigated on the pharmacokinetics of compound III in the 30 mg solid oral dosage form. Samples for pharmacokinetic assessment of parent drug were taken for up to 72 hours following dosing.

Doses of compound III in PEG300 based solutions at 1 3 10 30 and 100 mg were rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. All dose levels resulted in plasma compound III concentrations that were quantifiable through the last time point collected 72 hours . Exposure Cand AUC to compound III increased with increasing dose and was linear for solutions over the dose range 1 to 100 mg. Twas achieved between 0.8 and 2.3 hours median value 1.0 hours for compound III in solution and between 3.2 and 3.9 hours following the solid oral formulations . The terminal elimination half life ranged from 19 to 22 hours median value 20 hours for 1 100 mg solutions and the 3 mg capsule and was increased with the 30 mg capsules to 27 and 31 hours for micronized and non micronized although not significantly p 0.1 . Oral clearance was inversely associated with half life with the 30 mg non micronized capsule exhibiting the longest half life and the lowest clearance compared to the other dosage forms and amounts. The 3 mg non micronized capsule and solution were equally bioavailable but at the higher dose 30 mg micronization improved oral bioavailability p

1 3 10 and 30 mg of compound of formula III or matching placebo were administered daily by mouth for 14 days to 48 healthy young males and 23 males with truncal obesity.

One hundred Sprague Dawley rats 50 male and 50 female were divided into five groups n 10 per gender per group representing vehicle only PEG300 40 Cavasol 75 25 v v and four dose groups of Compound III. Animals were administered Compound III once daily by oral gavage according to their most recent body weight with doses of either 0 3 10 30 or 100 mg kg. During the study period rats had access to water and a standard laboratory diet of Harlan Taklad Rodent Chow ad libitum. After 28 consecutive days of dosing animals were fasted overnight blood samples were collected and processed to yield serum. Serum levels of total cholesterol were determined using an automated laboratory assay method.

The male and female rats in the vehicle only group 0 mg kg had serum total cholesterol values of 92 13.5 and 102 13 mg dL respectively. These values are considered within the normal historical range for the testing laboratory. Daily oral doses of Compound III at or above 3 mg kg caused a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels in both male and female rats. At 3 mg kg compared to vehicle control animals an approximate 30 reduction in total cholesterol was noted where males and females had 63 17.4 and 74 14.2 mg dL respectively. Although a slightly greater effect was noted at the highest dose group 100 mg kg per day in general a dose response relationship was not observed in the reduction of total cholesterol levels in the Sprague Dawley rat.

Water was added to dissolve the carbonate and ethyl acetate was added to help with the phase separations. The aqueous phase was separated as waste. The organic phase was washed with a second portion of water. The organic layer was transferred to a rotary evaporator and the solvent was removed. The solvent was exchanged into ethanol by charging ethanol into the rotovap flask and removing some of the ethanol to remove all of the ethyl acetate. The ethanol solution was added to water to precipitate the product. The crude product was collected by filtration and washed with water. The product was transferred back to the rotary evaporator for crystallization. Ethyl acetate was charged to the rotovap flask to exchange the solvent into ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate was removed under vacuum which dried the product. A minimum amount of ethyl acetate was added to dissolve the product at 60 C. T Butyl methyl ether was added to crystallize the product. After cooling the product was collected by filtration and washed with t Butyl methyl ether. The wet cake was added back to the rotary evaporator and ethanol was charged. A solvent exchange into ethanol removed the residual t Butyl methyl ether. Filtering the ethanol solution into water recrystallized the product. After stirring the product was collected by filtration and washed with water.

The in vitro activity of the SARM compounds specifically compound V demonstrated high androgen receptor binding affinity Ki 7.5 nM . Animal studies with the SARM compounds specifically compound V demonstrated that it is a potent androgenic and anabolic nonsteroidal agent. Four groups of rats were used for these studies 1 intact controls 2 castrated controls 3 castrated animals treated with testosterone propionate 100 g day and 4 castrated animals treated with compound V 1000 ug day . Testosterone and compound V were delivered at a constant rate for 14 days via subcutaneous osmotic pumps.

The results of these studies are shown in . Castration significantly reduced the weight of androgenic e.g. prostate and seminal vesicles and anabolic e.g. levator ani muscle tissues but had little effect on animal body weight BW . Treatment of castrated animals with testosterone propionate or compound V maintained the weight of androgenic tissues to the same degree. Compound V had similar androgenic activity as testosterone propionate i.e. the prostate and seminal vesicle weights were the same but much greater efficacy as an anabolic agent. Compound V showed greater anabolic activity than testosterone propionate at the doses tested i.e. the levator ani muscle maintained the same weight as intact control animals and was greater than that observed for testosterone . The experiments presented herein are the first in vivo results which demonstrate tissue selective androgenic and anabolic activity i.e. differing androgenic and anabolic potency of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor.

The in vivo efficacy and acute toxicity of four novel nonsteroidal androgens compounds V VI XIV XV in rats was examined. In vitro assays established that these compounds bind the androgen receptor with very high affinity. The structures and names of the four compounds are presented below 

Materials. The S isomers of compounds VI XIV XV and V and the R isomer of VI were synthesized in accordance with the scheme as set forth in . Testosterone propionate TP polyethylene glycol 300 PEG300 reagent grade and neutral buffered formalin 10 w v were purchased from Sigma Chemical Company St Louis Mo. . Alzet osmotic pumps model 2002 were purchased from Alza Corp. Palo Alto Calif. .

Animals. Immature male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 90 to 100 g were purchased from Harlan Biosciences Indianapolis Ind. . The animals were maintained on a 12 hour light dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.

Study Design. Rats were randomly distributed into twenty nine 29 groups with 5 animals per group. Treatment groups are described in Table 4. One day prior to the start of drug treatment animals in groups 2 through 29 were individually removed from the cage weighed and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine xylazine 87 13 mg kg approximately 1 mL per kg . When appropriately anesthetized i.e. no response to toe pinch the animals ears were marked for identification purposes. Animals were then placed on a sterile pad and their abdomen and scrotum washed with betadine and 70 alcohol. The testes were removed via a midline scrotal incision with sterile suture being used to ligate supra testicular tissue prior to surgical removal of each testis. The surgical wound site was closed with sterile stainless steel wound clips and the site cleaned with betadine. The animals were allowed to recover on a sterile pad until able to stand and then returned to their cage.

Twenty four hours later animals in groups 2 through 29 were re anesthetized with ketamine xylazine and an Alzet osmotic pump s model 2002 was placed subcutaneouly in the scapular region. In this instance the scapular region was shaved and cleaned betadine and alcohol and a small incision 1 cm made using a sterile scalpel. The osmotic pump was inserted and the wound closed with a sterile stainless steel wound clip. Animals were allowed to recover and were returned to their cage. Osmotic pumps contained the appropriate treatment designated in Table 1 dissolved in polyethylene glycol 300 PEG300 . Osmotic pumps were filled with the appropriate solution one day prior to implantation. Animals were monitored daily for signs of acute toxicity to drug treatment e.g. lethargy rough coat .

After 14 days of drug treatment rats were anesthetized with ketamine xylazine. Animals were then sacrificed by exsanguinations under anesthesia. A blood sample was collected by venipuncture of the abdominal aorta and submitted for complete blood cell analysis. A portion of the blood was placed in a separate tube centrifuged at 12 000 g for 1 minute and the plasma layer removed and frozen at 20.degree.C. The ventral prostates seminal vesicles levator ani muscle liver kidneys spleen lungs and heart were removed cleared of extraneous tissue weighed and placed in vials containing 10 neutral buffered formalin. Preserved tissues were sent to GTx Inc. for histopathological analysis.

For data analysis the weights of all organs were normalized to body weight and analyzed for any statistical significant difference by single factor ANOVA. The weights of prostate and seminal vesicle were used as indexes for evaluation of androgenic activity and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity.

The androgenic and anabolic activities the S isomers of compounds V VI XIV and XV and the R isomer of VI were examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration. Testosterone propionate at increasing doses was used as the positive control of anabolic and androgenic effects.

As shown in the weights of prostate seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle in castrated vehicle treated rats decreased significantly due to the ablation of endogenous androgen production. Exogenous administration of testosterone propionate an androgenic and anabolic steroid increased the weights of prostate seminal vesicle and levator and muscle in castrated rats in a dose dependent manner The R isomer of compound VI and S isomers of compound XIV and compound XV showed no effect on the weights of prostate seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle in castrated animals data not shown . The S isomers of compound V S V and compound VI S VI resulted in dose dependent increases in prostate seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle weights. Compared with testosterone propionate S V showed lower potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle but a greater potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle. Particularly compound S V at a dose as low as 0.3 mg day was able to maintain the levator ani muscle weight of castrated animals in the same level as that of intact animals. Thus S V is a potent nonsteroidal anabolic agent with less androgenic activity but more anabolic activity than testosterone propionate. This is a significant improvement over previous claims in that this compound selectively stimulates muscle growth and other anabolic effects while having less effect on the prostate and seminal vesicles. This may be particularly relevant in aging men with concerns related to the development or progression of prostate cancer.

Compound VI was less potent than compound V but showed greater tissue selectivity compare effects on the prostate and seminal vesicles in . Compound VI significantly increased levator ani muscle weights but showed little to no ability to stimulate prostate and seminal vesicle growth i.e. the prostate and seminal vesicle weights were less than 20 of that observed in intact animals or in animals treated with testosterone propionate .

Results showed that none of the examined compounds produced significant effect on body weight or the weights of other organs i.e. liver kidneys spleen lungs and heart . Nor did any compound produce any signs of acute toxicity as gauged by diagnostic hematology tests and visual examination of animals receiving treatments. Importantly compound V did not suppress the production of luteinizing hormone LH or follicle stimulating hormone FSH at a dose of 0.3 mg day i.e. a dose that exhibited maximal anabolic effects .

In summary compound S V exhibited exceptional anabolic activity in animals by maintaining the weight of levator ani muscle after removal of endogenous androgen. This discovery represents major progress towards the development of therapeutically useful nonsteroidal androgens and a major improvement i.e. tissue selectivity and potency over previous drugs in this class. Compounds S VI and S V showed selective anabolic activity in comparison with testosterone propionate an androgenic and anabolic steroid. The tissue selective activity is actually one of the advantages of nonsteroidal androgens in terms of anabolic related applications.

Despite similarities in structure and in vitro functional activity the S isomers of compounds V VI XIV XV exhibited profound differences in terms of their in vivo activity compound V the most efficacious androgenic and anabolic activity in animals with the anabolic activity greater than that of testosterone propionate. Compound VI showed a small degree of androgenic activity but an anabolic activity comparable to testosterone propionate. In contrast compounds XIV and XV failed to produce any androgenic or anabolic activity in vivo.

These studies show the discovery of two members compounds VI and V of a new class of SARMs SARMS that demonstrate potent anabolic effects e.g. muscle growth with less androgenic activity e.g. prostatic growth . This new class of drugs has several advantages over nonselective androgens including potential therapeutic applications in males and females for modulation of fertility erythropoiesis osteoporosis sexual libido and in men with or at high risk for prostate cancer.

Further demonstrate the effects of compounds V and VI and compound V on LH and FSH levels in rats. These results further demonstrate the novelty of these SARM due to their differential effects on these reproductive hormones thus demonstrating the tissue specific pharmacologic activity. In LH levels in castrated animals treated with TP and compound VI were significantly lower than those of untreated animals i.e. castrated controls at doses greater than or equal to 0.3 mg day. However higher doses i.e. 0.5 mg day or higher of compound V were required before significant decreases in LH levels were observed. Thus compound V does not suppress LH levels at doses that are capable of eliciting maximal stimulation of levator ani muscle growth. In FSH levels in castrated animals treated with compound VI were significantly lower than hose of untreated animals i.e. castrated controls at doses of 0.5 mg day or higher. Similarly lower FSH levels were observed in animals treated with TP. However only this difference was only significant at a dose of 0.75 mg day. FSH levels in animals treated with compound V were not significantly different from those of untreated animals at any dose level tested. Thus compound V does not suppress FSH levels at doses that are capable of eliciting maximal stimulation of levator ani muscle growth.

The pharmacokinetics of compound S V a novel SARM were characterized in beagle dogs. A four treatment four period crossover design was utilized in the study which involved a total of six beagle dogs three of each gender. Each animal received a 3 mg kg I.V. dose a 10 mg kg I.V. dose a 10 mg kg P.O. dose in solution and a 10 mg kg P.O. dose in capsule in a randomly assigned order. There was an one week washout period between treatments Plasma samples were collected for up to 72 hr after drug administration. Plasma S V concentrations were analyzed by a validated HPLC method. The clearance CL volume of distribution Vss half life T and other pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods. Results showed that compound S V was cleared from dog plasma with a terminal Tof about 4 hr and a CL of 4.4 mL min kg after I.V. administration. show the plasma concentration time profiles of compound S V after administration of an intravenous solution oral solution and oral capsule respectively. The Pharmacokinetics were dose and gender independent. The oral bioavailability of compound S V varied with the dosage form and averaged 38 and 19 for solution and capsule respectively. Thus compound S V demonstrated moderate half life slow clearance and moderate bioavailability in beagle dogs identifying it as the first of a new class of orally bioavailable tissue SARMs.

A reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatograph HPLC assay was developed to quantitate S V concentrations in dog plasma. Dog blood samples were obtained by venipuncture and centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 minutes. Samples were stored frozen at 20 C. until analysis. Individual samples were rapidly thawed and an aliquot 0.5 ml was spiked with internal standard 20 l of a 200 g ml aqueous solution of CM II 87 . An aliquot of 1 ml of acetonitrile was added to the samples to precipitate plasma proteins. The samples were vortexed and then centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 minutes. The supernatant was decanted into glass extraction tubes and 7.5 ml of ethyl acetate was added. The extraction mixture was left at room temperature for 20 minutes and vortexed several times during this interval. The samples were then centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 minutes and the organic phase was removed and placed in conical bottomed glass tubes. The organic phase was evaporated under nitrogen. The samples were reconstituted in 200 l of mobile phase 35 65 acetonitrile water and transferred to an autosampler vial for HPLC injection Waters 717 plus autosampler Waters Corp. Milford Mass. . The isocratic mobile phase of 35 v v acetonitrile in water was pumped at a flow rate of 1 ml min Model 510 Waters Corp. . The stationary phase was a C18 reversed phase column Novapac C18 3.9.times.150 mm . Analytes were monitored with UV detection at 270 nm Model 486 absorbance detector Waters Corp. . Retention times for S V and CM II 87 were 11.1 and 16.9 minutes respectively. Chromatography data was collected and analyzed using Millennium software. Plasma concentrations of S V in each sample were determined by comparison to calibration curves. Calibration curves were constructed by adding known amounts of compound V to dog plasma. Final compound V concentrations in dog plasma samples used in the calibration curves were 0.08 0.2 0.4 2 4 10 and 20 g ml. Calibration curves were linear over this concentration range and exhibited correlation coefficients r of 0.9935 or greater. Intra and inter day coefficients of variation for the standards ranged from 6.4 for 0.08 g ml to 7.9 for 20 g ml.

Animals. Immature male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 90 to 100 g were purchased from Harlan Biosciences Indianapolis Ind. . The animals were maintained on a 12 hour light dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.

Study Design. Rats were randomly distributed into treatment groups groups. One day prior to the start of drug treatment animals were individually removed from the cage weighed and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine xylazine 87 13 mg kg approximately 1 mL per kg . When appropriately anesthetized i.e. no response to toe pinch the animals ears were marked for identification purposes. Animals were then placed on a sterile pad and their abdomen and scrotum washed with betadine and 70 alcohol. The testes were removed via a midline scrotal incision with sterile suture being used to ligate supra testicular tissue prior to surgical removal of each testis. The surgical wound site was closed with sterile stainless steel wound clips and the site cleaned with betadine. The animals were allowed to recover on a sterile pad until able to stand and then returned to their cage.

Twenty four hours later animals were re anesthetized with ketamine xylazine and an Alzet osmotic pump s model 2002 was placed subcutaneouly in the scapular region. In this instance the scapular region was shaved and cleaned betadine and alcohol and a small incision 1 cm made using a sterile scalpel. The osmotic pump was inserted and the wound closed with a sterile stainless steel wound clip. Animals were allowed to recover and were returned to their cage. Osmotic pumps contained the appropriate treatment dissolved in polyethylene glycol 300 PEG300 . Osmotic pumps were filled with the appropriate solution one day prior to implantation. Animals were monitored daily for signs of acute toxicity to drug treatment e.g. lethargy rough coat .

After 14 days of drug treatment rats were anesthetized with ketamine xylazine. Animals were then sacrificed by exsanguinations under anesthesia. A blood sample was collected by venipuncture of the abdominal aorta and submitted for complete blood cell analysis. A portion of the blood was placed in a separate tube centrifuged at 12 000 g for 1 minute and the plasma layer removed and frozen at 20 C. The ventral prostates seminal vesicles levator ani muscle liver kidneys spleen lungs and heart were removed cleared of extraneous tissue weighed and placed in vials containing 10 neutral buffered formalin. Preserved tissues were sent to GTx Inc. for histopathological analysis.

For data analysis the weights of all organs were normalized to body weight and analyzed for any statistical significant difference by single factor ANOVA. The weights of prostate and seminal vesicle were used as indexes for evaluation of androgenic activity and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity.

The androgenic and anabolic activities of compounds 1 4 were examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration. The results are shown in A D as a percent of the Intact Control not castrated untreated . 0 mg day denotes Castrated Controls castrated untreated .

As shown in the weights of prostate seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle in castrated rats decreased significantly due to the ablation of endogenous androgen production. Treatment with increasing dosages of compounds 1 4 A D respectively resulted in a tissue selective increase in leyator ani muscle weights with little or no stimulation of prostate and seminal vesicle growth i.e. the prostate and seminal vesicle weights were less than 40 of that observed in intact animals for compound 2 and less than 20 for compounds 1 3 and 4 . Thus these compounds showed little potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle but a great potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle. Particularly compound 2 was able to maintain the levator ani muscle weight of castrated animals in the same level as that of intact animals. Thus compounds 1 4 are potent nonsteroidal anabolic agents. This is a significant improvement over previous compounds in that these compound selectively stimulate muscle growth and other anabolic effects while having less effect on the prostate and seminal vesicles. This may be particularly relevant in aging men with concerns related to the development or progression of prostate cancer.

The androgenic and anabolic activities of compound 5 were examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration using the method outlined in Example 1 above.

As shown in Table 8 and in compound 5 demonstrated tissue selective pharmacological effects in castrated male rats with higher efficacy in anabolic tissues i.e. levator ani as compared to androgenic tissues i.e. prostate and seminal vesicles . Compound 5 demonstrated little pharmacologic activity in the prostate 8.7 1.39 of intact at 1.0 mg day dose and seminal vesicles 10.7 0.91 of intact at 1.0 mg day dose suggesting that it acts as a weak partial agonist in these tissues. Importantly compound 5 demonstrates highly efficacious anabolic activity at 1.0 mg day dose returning the levator ani muscle to 75.2 9.51 of that observed in intact animals.

The androgenic and anabolic activities of compound 6 was examined in a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration using the method outlined in Example 1 above.

As shown in the weights of prostate seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle in castrated vehicle treated rats decreased significantly due to the ablation of endogenous androgen production. Exogenous administration of testosterone propionate an androgenic and anabolic steroid increased the weights of prostate seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle in castrated rats in a dose dependent manner. Treatment with compound 6 resulted in dose dependent increases in prostate seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle weights. Compared with testosterone propionate compound 6 showed lower potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle but a greater potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle. Particularly compound V at a dose as low as 0.3 mg day was able to maintain the levator ani muscle weight of castrated animals in the same level as that of intact animals. Thus compound 6 is a potent nonsteroidal anabolic agent with less androgenic activity but more anabolic activity than testosterone propionate. As in compounds 1 5 above this is a significant improvement in that this compound selectively stimulates muscle growth and other anabolic effects while having less effect on the prostate and seminal vesicles.

The in vitro androgen receptor binding affinity of other SARM compounds was studied and the results are presented in Table 10.

The purpose of this study was to examine the in vitro and in vivo pharmacologic activities of four compounds N 1 through N 4 incorporating 4 nitro and or 4 cyano substituents in the A and B ring.

Relative binding affinity RBA was calculated as RBA Ki of DHT Ki of compound of interest and determined using H mibolerone and androgen receptor AR isolated from rat ventral prostate. In vivo pharmacologic activities were determined by weight increase of intact control of anabolic levator ani muscle and androgenic prostate seminal vesicle target tissues of castrated that received 1 mg day of tested compounds for 14 days.

The RBA of N 1 N 2 N 3 and N 4 was 30 26 32 and 17 respectively. The compounds demonstrated little pharmacologic activity in the prostate and seminal vesicles but significantly increased the weight of the levator ani muscle to 105 13 119 16 130 5 and 142 17 respectively of that observed in intact controls. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the clearance of compounds incorporating a 4 nitro substituent in the A or B ring was significantly higher than that of the di cyano substituted compound N 4 Compound III described hereinabove .

Inclusion of a 4 nitro substituent in the A ring of these derivatives increased in vitro AR binding affinity but resulted in increased in vivo clearance. All compounds demonstrated potent and tissue selective in vivo pharmacologic effects. In vivo activity did not correlate with in vitro binding affinity. However N 4 demonstrated the greatest activity and lowest in vivo clearance corroborating the importance of in vivo pharmacokinetics and metabolism to SARM activity.

This solid was recrystallized from CHCl hexane to give 55.8 g 73.9 of 2R 3 Bromo N 4 cyano 3 trifluoromethyl phenyl 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropanamide as a light yellow solid.

Synthesis of S N 4 Cyano 3 trifluoromethyl phenyl 3 4 cyanophenoxy 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropanamide. A mixture of bromoamide 2R 3 Bromo N 4 cyano 3 trifluoromethyl phenyl 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropanamide 50 g 0.14 mol anhydrous KCO 59.04 g 0.43 mol 4 cyanophenol 25.44 g 0.21 mol in 500 mL of 2 propanol was heated to reflux for 3 h and then concentrated under reduced pressure to give a solid. The resulting residue was treated with 500 mL of HO and then extracted with EtOAc 2 300 mL . The combined EtOAc extracts were washed with 10 NaOH 4 200 mL and brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSOand then concentrated under reduced pressure to give an oil which was treated with 300 mL of ethanol and an activated carbon. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 1 h and then the hot mixture was filtered through Celite. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give an oil. This oil was purified by column chromatography using CHCl EtOAc 80 20 to give an oil which was crystallized from CHCl hexane to give 33.2 g 59.9 of S N 4 cyano 3 trifluoromethyl phenyl 3 4 cyanophenoxy 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropanamide as a colorless solid a cotton type .

A series of SARMs that are p nitro m trifluoromethyl substituted in the A ring and p acetamide or p fluoro substituted in the B ring with the 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropionanilide linker and a variety of X position functional groups in the linker were synthesized and analysed Table 12 .

Dihydrotestosterone induced transcriptional activation was suppressed by 33 and 18 for non hydrogen compounds 9 and 10 X CH respectively of Table 9 demonstrating that these agents were not strong antagonists of in vitro transcriptional activation. The non hydrogen bonding AR ligands 9 and 10 of Table 9 were high affinity ligands with Kvalues of 9 nM and 26 nM respectively but demonstrated reduced in vitro functional activity of 29 and 16 respectively as seen in Table 9. Shortening the linker by one carbon 10 was detrimental effect to affinity and functional activation.

In addition Y position effects were seen Table 9 . Of the series of compounds evaluated the p acetamide was favorable for affinity and in vitro transcriptional activity. The exceptions to this rule were compounds 7 vs. 8 X NH for affinity and 3 vs. 4 X S for in vitro activation. For these compounds the Y position has a hydrogen bonding interaction within the AR binding pocket. It is plausible that with regard to these compounds the p acetamide displaces the HO molecule and interacts directly with the histidine thereby more effectively stabilizing the active conformation of the AR SARM complex.

The non hydrogen bonding compounds 9 and 10 reduced in vitro transcriptional activation abilities of 29 and 16 respectively despite the high affinities of 9 nM and 26 nM respectively. Thus for these compounds a hydrogen bond acceptor HBA X position ability is critical for AR activation.
