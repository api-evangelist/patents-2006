No. 10 490 195 filed on Mar. 9 2004 now abandoned which is a U.S. National Phase of International Application No. PCT IE02 00142 filed Oct. 9 2002 which corresponds to WIPO Publication No. WO 03 046913 published on Jun. 5 2003 and the subject application is the U.S. National Phase of and Applicant claims priority from International Application Number PCT IE2006 000143 filed 19 Dec. 2006 Irish Application bearing Serial No. S2005 0846 filed 19 Dec. 2005 and Irish Application bearing Serial No. S2006 0492 filed 30 Jun. 2006 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

The present invention relates to an interactive multimedia apparatus usable in combination with a software suite of authoring programs installed in a computing means of a mobile data processing apparatus of the type having a display means and one or more input means.

The present invention is an improvement to the apparatus disclosed by the applicants in International Patent Publication No. WO2003 046913 the contents of which specification are incorporated herein by direct reference.

Electronic mixing software for PC and computer based products is known and there are packages available both commercially and as freeware over the internet. These packages allow users create tracks which contain loops riffs beats one shots or the contents of a CD track microphone inputs video files etc and to mix them together to produce their desired sound output compilation. The user places each selected loop riff one shot video clip CD output microphone input etc. in a selected track position along the time axis ruler bar so that they are mixed at that time in the play cycle. The content which can be WAV MP3 WMA or any other digital media format being mixed has been prepared at a recorded tempo and is of a fixed length of time. The desired mix will usually contain multiple tracks of differing beats loops riffs one shots voices video etc.

Most digital mixing software packages allow the user to set up a series of controls and effects for each channel in advance of the mixing process occurring and will also allow some limited global control of the composite mix output. The control and effects are usually applied in advance of the mixing process occurring but some limited control is allowed during the mixing cycle. Some of the individual track parameters which are allowed to be altered during the mixing process would include volume mute tempo and tone. Special effects are not normally allowed during the mixing process.

There are many digital software music editing packages available on the market both commercially and as freeware over the internet. These packages allow the user to edit riffs loops beats one shots CD outputs and other media context by cut paste copy and other known techniques for editing digital content. The editing process requires the user to select a portion of the waveform and reposition or alter the characteristics and parameters of the waveform. The user can change the characteristics of the waveform add effects move it or reposition it with the same track cut and paste it or copy it to a newly created track. The editing process is accomplished by using either a mouse or a keyboard or a combination of both. If the user wishes to use only a segment of a loop beat riff one shot video clip microphone input etc they must first pre edit it and then insert it in a track in its play position along the time axis ruler to be mixed at that predefined time in the mix cycle.

A problem with these known applications is that they are not able to be deployed to devices with limited processing power and in particular mobile data processing apparatuses such as mobile telephones.

With reference to the size of the mix can be pre determined by a Wizard function once that size has been reached the application will automatically stop the current mix at that point.

The user can also Render the Mix to the Device and decide on the type of file they wish to create i.e. unlimited mix ring tone video tune wallpaper or caller ID.

A further embodiment of the present invention shall now be described again with reference to in which the present invention has been deployed on a mobile telephone or other mobile communications device. In this embodiment reference will be made to the use of audio files having the .WAV file format however it is to be understood that present invention can be implemented for use with a wide variety of file types including audio files video files still image files and a text files and is this suitable for use with formats including JPEG TIFF MPEG AVI and so forth.

On starting the application by selecting the Music Mix icon audio file scanning of all files accessible by the mobile telephone commences. Thus if a hard disc or memory card such as for example an SD memory card has been inserted into mobile telephone it to is also scanned.

As shown in a list of all waveform audio files .WAV located during the search is generated and presented to users in a folder entitled My Music . A template folder within the operating system of the mobile telephone is also scanned for template files. Each template consists of four .WAV channels beat matched ready for mixing. During the scanning period the message Scanning please wait is displayed on the display means and whilst this message is being displayed the music mix icon is disabled and may be greyed out so as to indicate to users that it is presently unavailable for selection.

It will be appreciated that the present invention provides a Windows Explorer like interface and shows a list of folders indicating the location of the files found during file scanning. This includes the My Music folder icon and the templates folder icon . The right side of the screen shows the four beat matched .WAV channels and the currently assigned files for each of the beat matched .WAV channel.

Navigation between the display icons is controlled using the left and right arrow keys of the alphanumeric keypad of the mobile telephone. Each feature on the display is highlighted in turn by manipulation of the left and right arrow keys. If an icon is highlighted and the enter key is then selected pressed then the icon is selected.

The icons on the left hand side of the display may be navigated and selected by for example double tapping on a folder to change the explorer view to list the files or directories in the current folder and to list the files name and extension as well as by using the up and down arrow keys to move between icons and then selecting or pressing the enter key to expand or collapse a drop down directory.

With reference now to the transmission of a file to a channel is shown and involves either dragging and then dropping a selected file onto a channel icon or selecting a desired file by reference to a file indicator and then using up down arrow keys and then pressing enter to display the channels in this case four channels to which the files may be transmitted. The user selects the desired channel or alternatively can cancel the operation.

When a file is transmitted to a channel it starts playing automatically. Stop icons or buttons are displayed next to each channel to allow the user to stop a channel at any time. If a second or subsequent channel is played while a first channel is actually playing then the first channel is automatically stopped prior to the second or subsequent channel being played.

With reference to template selection is achieved using either dragging and dropping of one or more template wherein dropping a template onto any channel loads the selected template thereby assigning the component files to the channels one to four automatically. Alternatively the arrow keys on alphanumeric keypad of the mobile telephone may be used to select one or more desired templates and subsequently pressing the enter key to load the selected template s to the required channels.

A play button is additionally displayed for each channel to allow playing of each template channel component.

A preview play icon is provided which if selected plays the file in each channel continuously in a loop until the user clicks the stop icon.

Also shown are volume levels icons support for playback of four channels in real time as opposed to static intervention after the composition has been generated. The user is also able to hear the resulting mix of the four channels in real time. Furthermore the user can toggle between each channel during a mixing session and use the volume slider on each channel during a mix as well as setting various composition authoring parameters.

With reference to the display shown indicates various options available to user with regard to the multimedia composition. For example users may wish to listen to the mix and then use the resultant composition which it will be appreciated is also stored as a file. A preview control panel is provided which allows the user to preview a composition prior to saving or indeed assigning as a file for a new composition. The preview control panel includes a play button to start playing the mix and a stop button to stop playing the mix. The preview control panel also has a slider bar to indicate the position of the track in time during play of the mix. This indicator in the slider bar moves along while the mix is playing to indicate the current position in the mix track.

Located directly below the preview control panel is a menu providing various user options including saving the composition to a file. This option if selected will bring the user to the Windows Mobile standard save file as screen see . Also included are options to set the composition as a ring tone set composition as a caller ID send the composition as an email send the composition as a text message MMS and delete the composition.

Located at the bottom of the screen are back button which provides a cancel option an Options button and a help button which launches the Windows TM Mobile help application loaded with html for this application see .

Referring now to and the format of the standard Windows TM Mobile Save As screen standard Windows TM mobile voice recorder application and standard Windows Mobile help application loaded with html help pages for this application are shown therein. The display of these elements can be supported in landscape or portrait mode.

In this present instance the composition created from the four channels is saved in .WAV format. The file size is limited to 95 of the available space left in the mobile teleohones accessible data store. The mix recording session is stopped if the file gets too large and the user is notified by an alert in a pop up screen. Furthermore the user is notified if a record session is started and there is not enough space left to continue.

Referring now specifically to the present invention has a system structure comprising a user interface layer an audio mixing engine layer and a phone audio driver layer entitled WAV1 . The audio mixing engine layer is implemented as a flat dynamic link library DLL and comprising a number of application programming interfaces APIs which are able to be deployed to the mobile telephone. There shall also be a library file for the user interface executables to link to and a header file for function prototypes.

Referring now to the engine supports four players in which one player is assigned to each channel. This allows the control means of the present invention to play each file selected for a specified channel. The actual combining or mixing of the four channels is performed using the auxiliary audio driver . The output from this driver is relayed to the phone audio driver to play the composition in real time. The output from the auxiliary driver also writes the mixed samples to a temporary file located in the data store accessible by the mobile telephone.

It is preferable for there to be sufficient CPU resources to render and play the composition in real time. In the event that there is insufficient CPU resources a two stage process implemented. The phone audio driver is used to play and mix the file content in real time and to log the mixing volume changes as well as channel toggles then renders the mix to a file as a separate stage using the auxiliary audio driver . Each player is capable of playing the content of a specified file. There is an API to assign a file to one of the four channels. Each player then has an API to start a channel playing and to stop it for the purpose of previewing a selected file. Each player shall use the waveform audio API set to write audio samples to the phone audio driver when playing a single channel and the auxiliary audio driver when in mixing mode. There are also APIs to start and stop the mixing process.

The auxiliary audio driver is responsible for performing the audio mixing. It will be appreciated that in the event that different file types such as video image and or text are being mixed then these components may be adjusted as required to take account of the different file types. The auxiliary audio driver is based on a Unified Audio Model UAM driver that has support for multiple streams and built in mixing. The output from the players is input to this auxiliary audio driver . The resultant mixed stream is available for live play by transmitting it to the phone audio driver using the waveform audio API set and is available for writing to a temporary file to store the mix as a file. Ideally the mixed stream is 44.1 kHz audio. The driver is called auxwav.dll and is loaded when the mixer application is run for the first time using the RegisterDevice API.

The data store accessible to the mobile telephone also uses a file system which is responsible for saving the raw samples output from the auxiliary wave driver . This may be a temporary file and would optimally be located in My Music tempmix.WAV and is a stereo 16 bit sampling frequency 44.1 kHz. All APIs return a HRESULT. S OK output for success and E INVALIDARG for illegal input parameters.

This API performs initialisation for the control means and must It needs to be called each time the multimedia application is launched.

This starts the mixing session. All four channels are played live at the same time. The mixed file is recorded to the temporary file My Music tempmix.WAV . If there is not enough space to continue then ERROR DISK FULL is returned. If space runs out during a mix session a windows message is broadcast as described later.

The following API is used to retrieve the versions of the auxwav driver dll and the StikAx Mixer dll.

When there is insufficient memory space left on the filing system during saving of a mixed file a message stating DISK FULL is displayed.
