The entire contents of each of the above documents is hereby incorporated by reference.

This invention relates to an antistatic composition and more particularly to an antistatic composition in which the bleeding out is difficult to occur and whose electric resistivity and formability are good. Further the present invention relates to an antistatic composition which can be widely used in the field of melt formable forming materials and which is decomposable with microorganisms. The antistatic composition of the present invention is suitable for applications requiring high degree antistatic treatment including applications such as packaging and conveyance of electronic and electric parts.

The antistatic compositions have widely prevailed in the industrial world and have been utilized in various applications. As the antistatic compositions there are for example compositions in which resins and or elastomers are highly filled with conductive fillers such as carbon black. Such compositions have been widely utilized mainly in the industrial field.

Further electrostatic prevention type antistatic compositions in which electrostatic prevention type antistatic resins having surfactants or hydrophilic segments in their structure are polymer alloyed have also widely prevailed and have been widely applied to various applications.

In recent years antistatic polymer materials have prevailed in packaging of IC chips and these materials have also been diversified from general purpose plastics to engineering plastics. Further measures for electrostatic prevention of precision instruments and relating instruments thereto have become increasingly important. As for the conductive fillers carbon fiber graphite metal coated fillers metal fiber and the like as well as carbon black have been widely properly used depending on their purpose and function.

However the conductive fillers have the inherent problem that the mechanical characteristics of polymers are deteriorated or that forming is difficult.

In particular into so called thermoplastic elastomers having flexibility the addition of the conductive fillers causes the problem that the flexibility rubber elasticity a material characteristic is impaired. In some cases the elastomers become very brittle by aging which causes an extreme reduction in elongation to result in easy breakage.

Polyester elastomers have excellent characteristics such as high strength wear resistance oil resistance chemical resistance and the like and can be said to be representative of the thermoplastic elastomers. Although the polyester elastomers have flexibility they generally have high hardness compared to the other elastomers and have been widely used for applications from automobiles and home electric appliances including industrial members to convenience goods. In particular they have been used mainly in applications requiring high hardness. As the conductive fillers added to the polyesterelastomers carbon black has been generally used. However there is the inherent problem that carbon black added is unevenly distributed in specified phases thereby deactivating the rubber elasticity to become brittle as materials or that the conductivity fluctuates depending on the treatment conditions. Further the addition of carbon black has raised the problems of deteriorated conductive performance due to a reduction in wear resistance and poor design caused by color limitation to black.

As a method for obtaining antistatic properties using no conductive filler there is a method of adding a so called low molecular type hydrophilic surfactant. Further a modifying method according to a glycol based polymer material and an ion such as a mixture of an alkylene glycol copolymer resin and an ionic electrolyte is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Hei 2 284967 and the like. However the low molecular type hydrophilic surfactant has problems with regard to persistency of the effect heat resistance bleeding out high resistivity and the like. Further the mixture of the alkylene glycol copolymer resin and the ionic electrolyte has the problem that the bleeding out easily occurs by concernment of temperature and moisture because a terminal of the alkylene glycol copolymer resin has a hydroxyl group. Furthermore the amount to be added is limited by the presence of a hard segment crystalline component of the polyester elastomer so that there is the problem that the resistivity of the composition does not reach a sufficient level.

Further thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers have excellent wear resistance and mechanical strength and are widely applied. Conductive polyurethane elastomers containing conductive fillers also prevail. In recent years with the spread of precision instruments higher antistatic functions have been required and the conventional antistatic level has become insufficient. The thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers compounded with the conductive fillers represented by carbon black are excellent in conductivity but bring about a reduction in flexibility and processability. Besides they have the problem of the dropout of the conductive materials due to a reduction in wear resistance and the problem of poor design caused by color limitation to black.

Further as for antistatic compositions as materials for IC trays which have hitherto been used for package of IC chips weight saving thinning and downsizing have come to be studied and strength and high rigidity tend to be required. Furthermore for the identification of the kind of IC and the like it is also required that design such as coloring is given to trays and carrier tapes. Carbon black generally used in the conductive fillers is economical and provides compositions having low resistivity. However the color is limited to black and generally a problem arises with regard to processability material strength and the like. Accordingly carbon black has been usually used as composite materials compounded together with various modifying materials.

Antistatic agents include surface activity type ones giving the function by allowing them to bleed on surfaces and ones allowing the function to be exhibited by polymer alloying hydrophilic polymer materials referred to as so called polymerty peantist aticagents. In the polymer type antistatic agents permanent antistatic performance is imparted to thermoplastic resins by polymer alloying with the hydrophilic polymers and the industrial utility value thereof is high. However it is required that the alloyed antistatic resins are added in relatively large amounts and many antistatic resins are hydrophilic segments and have flexibility. Accordingly the rigidity of the materials is lowered and the deformation problem of formed articles arises. Although it has been tried to modify these resins by using them in combination with inorganic fillers glass fiber or the like flashing weld marks flash marks shagginess and the like are developed on the surfaces of formed articles resulting in insufficient surface smoothness. The hindrance to surface smoothness causes wide variations in surface resistivity value or exerts effects on contact states of electronic and electric parts thereby inhibiting the antistatic functions.

In these compositions the surface resistivity value considered to be an antistatic level is usually up to 10to 10 sq.

In recent years by an increase in performance and capacity of ICs LSIs and the like a characteristic of 10 sq. or less has come to be required as the electric characteristics required for the package application such as trays and the so called conventional antistatic region level has become insufficient. Ones constituted by carbon black has been overwhelmingly used. As for these characteristics generally required are also strength and elastic modulus in bending and inorganic fillers are generally added in relatively large amounts in order to meet the requirements Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Sho 59 96142 . However mica talc and the like widely used as the inorganic fillers are added in relatively large amounts so that materials constituted by the conductive fillers have the problem that variations in conductivity become wide as well as the problem that deterioration of processability and impact resistant strength and the like are promoted.

On the other hand in order to prevent deterioration of these strength characteristics chopped fibers such as glass fiber carbon fiber and the like are used in combination in some cases. Although these chopped fibers are effective for imparting rigidity and strength the surface smoothness of formed articles such as flashing weld marks flash marks shagginess and the like is not satisfied. Further with deterioration of the surface state of the formed articles the contact with instruments becomes insufficient which hinders leakage of charges.

In recent years it has become important to impart antistatic properties to rubber and in order to achieve this there is known a method of coating a surface of a formed article with an antistatic agent such as a surfactant or a method of kneading an antistatic agent therein. However in the former method the antistatic properties are significantly deteriorated with the elapse of a long period of time so that it is difficult to put to practical use as highly antistatic rubber having persistency. On the other hand in the later method there is the problem that the antistatic agent bleeds out on the surface of the formed article or the problem that the antistatic effect is reduced because of poor compatibility of the antistatic agent with the rubber.

Further a method of kneading carbon black carbon fiber or the like in rubber has also been proposed. According to this method the above mentioned problem can be solved because of persistency of the antistatic properties and electrostatic prevention. However the problem that the rubber hardness becomes high to impair flexibility is encountered in addition to the new problem that coloration can not be freely conducted.

Here as a problem for solving dispersibility and compatibility of these problems of the antistatic rubber composition there is proposed a method of compounding an antistatic plasticizer and rubber. This is a method in which the antistatic properties are given to the plasticizer for chlorine containing resin which is a component indispensable to various kinds of processes. For example a vinyl chloride composition containing an antistatic plasticizer comprising lithium perchlorate is illustrated in Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Sho 64 9258 and Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Hei 2 255852.

However the addition of a perchlorate such as lithium perchlorate arises the problem that the heat stability of a vinyl chloride based resin is impaired. Further the addition thereof to chlorine containing rubber such as chloroprene rubber arises the problem that the heat stability is impaired.

Further Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Hei 9 227743 proposes a method of adding a plasticizer and lithium bis trifluoromethanesulfonyl imide to a vinyl chloride based resin thereby providing a transparent conductive composition. This composition is a transparent conductive composition so that it can be easily colored. However this composition has the problem that it turns burned umber on heating at 120 C. for 90 minutes to lose the transparency and the conductivity because of its poor heat resistance. Further this composition has the problem that the plasticizer bleeds out.

The synthetic resins synthesized from petroleum starting materials are represented by polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene polyvinyl chloride polyesters polyamides and the like and have been widely used from essential commodities of life to industrial products. The convenience and economical efficiency of these synthetic resins come to largely support our life and the synthetic resins have surely become the basis of the petrochemical industry.

Therefore the amount of production of the synthetic resins domestically produced amounts to about 15 000 000 tons per year and they are discarded in prodigious quantities amounting to about one third thereof. Accordingly waste disposal by burning and reclamation had already reached the critical limit. In recent years movements such as resource recovery recycling and the like have been intensified and the synthetic resins are newly added in the Containers and Packaging Recycling Law enforced from 2000. It is therefore predicted that strong and effective recovery and reusing of the synthetic resins are required. However in view of the synthetic resins produced in prodigious quantities every year situations where recycling is difficult such as the use in applications where recovery is difficult are left.

Further synthetic resin products scattered in the natural environment has become significant from year to year which cause serious social problems such as an increase in necessity of wildlife protection and destruction of living environments.

Such problems over the environment have attracted more attention from year to year and the central government including the Ministry for the Environment and respective local governments have been driven by the necessity for seriously taking measures to meet the situation.

In the synthetic resin market movements to demands for decomposability of the resins in the natural environment have been intensified and biodegradable resins have been developed which are decomposed and made to resource in the course of time even when thrown away outdoors. On the other hand from measures against toxic gases generated in burning the synthetic resins synthetic materials nearer to natural materials have been desired and also as part of the burning measures demands for the biodegradable resins have risen.

The biodegradable resins are resins degradable with microorganisms in the soil seawater rivers and lakes and expansion to applications in which recycling of synthetic resin wastes is inefficient and economically poor has been rapidly spread. Also as for measures against scattered trash the value of the biodegradable resins has been increasingly recognized and it is expected that the utilization thereof is hereafter further widened.

At present construction of commercial composts proceeds in various locations. On the other hand the sale of composts for domestic use toward individual consumers also starts. Thus expansion of the biodegradable resins has been expected in various locations. Also in the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry the practical application investigative committee has started and movements toward the promotion of the biodegradable resins have been intensified. Further viewing worldwide a massive market is predicted to appear in which a considerable part of demands for the synthetic resins on the scale of an annual production of 100 000 000 tons is occupied by the biodegradable resins. In the 21st century serious expansion of the biodegradable resin market is surely predicted.

As biodegradable materials and environmentally low load type materials which are in practical use at present there are known aliphatic polyesters modified starch polylactic acid various composite materials in which these resins are used as matrixes polymer alloys and the like. Of these the aliphatic polyester resins have high biodegradability and has been widely studied as packaging materials.

On the other hand packaging materials subjected to so called antistatic treatment are required for packaging electronic and electric materials. In recent years however materials more excellent in antistatic ability have been required in order to increase the capacity of semiconductors and to prevent electrostatic destruction of precision instruments.

Measures to electrostatic charges have hitherto been conducted by compelxing according to the addition of surfactants or persistent polymer type surfactants. However many of the packaging materials made of synthetic resins which have been subjected to so called antistatic treatment become discarded wastes after the packaging and conveying functions have been performed. Although the Containers and Packaging Recycling Law has prevailed and recycle systems have been enforced in recent years many of the packaging materials are still difficult to be recovered and disposed by way of such as burning and reclamation. In such a situation ecologically concerned materials have come to be necessary also for packaging materials requiring high antistatic functions and measures have been studied by various techniques.

Many of the biodegradable resins are hydrophilic ones which include for example cellulose acetate poly caprolactone polyvinyl alcohol and the like and functionally have antistatic characteristics. However the antistatic properties depend on the environmental humidity so that the variation in antistatic performance becomes wide. Further there is also proposed a method of adding conductive fillers such as carbon black and the like thereby imparting and stabilizing antistatic performance. However the use of the conductive fillers limits color tones to black so that there is the problem that the use as packaging materials make it difficult to identify internal products or that forming processing is difficult to allow the resistivity to fluctuate according to the forming situation.

Further there is also reported the case that the addition of carbon black to a biodegradable resin generally reduces the biodegradable function.

Cases of static prevention using the biodegradable materials are disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Hei 9 263690 Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Hei 11 039945 and the like. However in such static prevention there are problems that it is necessary to mix the conductive fillers in relatively large amounts so that the material themselves are apt to become hard and brittle that the color tones of the products are limited to black so that identification of the inside is impossible when the products are used as packaging materials and that the antistatic properties are lost according to forming conditions particularly physical functions in stretching processing.

Further when the surfactants are added to the biodegradable resin materials thereby imparting the antistatic properties problems are encountered with regard to persistency of the effect wide variations in time showing the effect durability such as environmental humidity dependency and the environment used.

In the meantime polyamide resins are excellent in wear resistance chemical resistance and heat resistance and have been widely used. However the developments of polyamide compositions high in electric insulation and excellent in conductivity have been expected.

Further polyamide elastomers have excellent wear resistance and mechanical strength and are widely applied. Conductive polyamide elastomers containing conductive fillers also widely prevail. In recent years with the spread of precision instruments higher antistatic functions have been required and the conventional antistatic level has become insufficient. The thermoplastic polyamide resins and the thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers compounded with the conductive fillers represented by carbon black are excellent in conductivity but bring about a reduction in flexibility and processability. Besides they have the problem of the dropout of the conductive materials due to a reduction in wear resistance and the problem of poor design caused by color limitation to black.

On the other hand one in which the so called hydrophilic surfactant is used as a conductive material the mixture of the alkylene glycol copolymer resin family and the ionic electrolyte Japanese Patent Laid Open Publication Hei 2 284967 and the like are proposed. However the bleeding out easily occurs according to the temperature and moisture because the terminal of the copolymer has a hydroxyl group and problems arise with regard to surface stains and persistency of the effect.

The present invention has been made against the background of such conventional technical problems and an object thereof is to obtain an antistatic composition in which the bleeding out of an electric conductive substance is little and whose antistatic property and formability are good.

The compositions of the present invention are described below in the order of the first to 3 3 compositions. However for the components already described in each composition descriptions thereof are omitted.

The first composition is the antistatic composition wherein the composition contains 0.001 3.0 parts by weight of B at least one lithium salt selected from the group consisting of lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate lithium bis trifluoromethanesulfonyl imide and lithium tris trifluoromethanesulfonyl methide based on 100 parts by weight of J polyether segment containing antistatic elastomers.

The addition of these metal salts in small amounts reduces the resistivity resulting in further exhibition of the above mentioned antistatic effect.

The composition of the present invention the first composition to the 3 3 composition contains at least one of these metal salts.

Then J polyether segment containing antistatic elastomers of the present invention has the function as Electrostatic discharge polymers ESD Polymers or Inherently dissipative polymers . Component J is polymer compound which is incorporated electrically conductive unit in there molecule.

 J polyether segment containing antistatic elastomers include a polyamide elastomer a polyester elastomer a polyurethane elastomer and the like. The above mentioned elastomer is preferably one having a soft segment and a hard segment. The soft segment achieves the effect that an elastomer molecular chain moves easily resulting in the lower glass transition temperature Tg of the elastomer. Examples thereof include a polyether segment and a polyester segment. The hard segment restrains the partial molecular movement and can be a physical crosslinking point. The combination of these segments achieves the effect of providing a thermoplastic elastomer excellent in rubber elasticity and maintaining mechanical characteristics of the elastomer. Examples thereof include polyester polyamide and polyurethane elastomers and the like.

The polyamide elastomer used as component J of the present invention is the general term for thermoplastic elastomers each having a polyamide restricting phase which is a hard segment and a polyether or polyester structure as a soft segment. For example a polyamide elastomer in which a PA 12 component is used as the polyamide PA restricting phase is obtained by a method of reacting lauroyl lactam a dicarboxylic acid and a polyetherdiol under pressure and heating by addition of a lactam ring opening catalyst to obtain a carboxyl telechelic nylon 12 oligomer and then a thermoplastic elastomer by condensation reaction with the polyetherdiol. In addition to this PA 6 or the like can be used as the polyamide restricting phase.

The above mentioned synthesis method provides the polyamide elastomer having the basic structure of a polyether block polyamide elastomer or a polyetherester block polyamide elastomer. Here the polyamide elastomer having various characteristics is obtained according to the kind of diol used in the above mentioned synthesis method and the like.

The polyamide elastomers are high in high temperature characteristics and excellent in mechanical characteristics oil resistance low temperature characteristics and the like so that they have been widely used for sports goods and the like as well as for machine parts automotive parts and the like.

The polyester elastomer used as component J of the present invention is a multi block copolymer using a polyester as a hard segment in a molecule and a polyether or a polyester having a low glass transition temperature Tg as a soft segment. The polyester elastomer include a polyester polyether type using an aromatic crystalline polyester such as polybutylene terephthalate or the like as a hard segment and a polyether as a soft segment a polyester polyester type using an aromatic crystalline polyester as a hard segment and an aliphatic polyester as a soft segment and the like.

The polyester polyether type is for example one synthesized by the ester exchange reaction and the polycondensation reaction using dimethyl terephthalate 1 4 butanediol polytetramethylene ether glycol and the like as starting materials. Further the polyester polyether type can also be synthesized by the ester exchange reaction and the ring opening reaction using dimethyl terephthalate 1 4 butanediol caprolactone and the like as starting materials.

The polyurethane elastomer used as component J of the present invention is an urethane group containing thermoplastic elastomer and a straight chain multi block copolymer of a polyurethane as a soft segment which is obtained by the reaction of a long chain glycol with an isocyanate and a polyurethane as a hard segment which is composed of a short chain glycol and an isocyanate. A crosslinking agent chain extender is also used as needed.

Here according to the general classification of the long chain glycols based on the kind polyether based glycols include polyethylene oxide polypropylene oxide and a copolymer thereof polyester based glycols include a polyadipate a polylactone and a polycarbonate and aliphatic glycols include polybutadiene polyisoprene and the like.

Further as the short chain glycol there is generally used an aliphatic glycol such as ethylene glycol 1 4 butanediol or 1 6 hexanediol an alicyclic glycol such as cyclohexanedimethanol and an aromatic glycol such as hydroquinonebis 2 hydroxyethyl ether.

On the other hand as the above mentioned isocyanate there is used 4 4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate MDI 2 4 2 6 toluene diisocyanate TDI or the like.

Further as the above mentioned crosslinking agent chain extender there is used an aromatic diamine such as 3 3 dichloro 4 4 diaminophenylmethane MBOCA .

In addition an aliphatic polyester resin having a low glass transition temperature and the like are available as component J .

Among the polyester elastomers the polyetheresteramide is particularly preferred as component J . In general a polyether type nonionic surfactant has hydrophilicity by virtue of hydrogen bonding of an oxygen atom of an ether bond in a polyether chain with a hydrogen atom of a water molecule.

The above mentioned polyetheresteramide is one type of such polyether segment containing high molecular nonionic surfactants. Specific examples of the polyetheresteramides include a polyethylene glycol polyamide copolymer a polyethylene glycol methacrylate copolymer a polyethylene oxide polypropylene oxide copolymer a polyethylene glycol based polyesteramide copolymer a polyethylene glycol based polyester elastomer and the like which are polyether segment containing antistatic elastomers. The antistatic elastomer is preferably a polyetheresteramide resin derived from an alkylene oxide addition product of a polyamide having carboxyl groups at both terminals and a bisphenol and or from a polyoxyalkylene glycol.

The polyetheresteramide may previously optionally contain at least one of the above mentioned component B .

These elastomers have hydrophilic segments such as polyethers in their structure and the elastomers themselves have the antistatic function so that the antistatic function can be imparted by polymer alloying the elastomers with thermoplastic resins. However the surface resistivity value obtained is up to a level of 10to 10 sq. and can not be reduced to 10 sq. or less.

These elastomers can also be used together with other polymers in the polymer alloy or polymer blend form.

The glass transition temperature Tg of component J of the present invention is preferably 50 C. or less more preferably 40 C. or less and particularly preferably 30 C. or less. When it exceeds 50 C. it is difficult to exhibit the antistatic function in the ordinary use environment.

The amount of component B compounded is from 0.001 to 3.0 parts by weight and preferably from 0.05 to 2.0 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of component J . Less than 0.001 part by weight results in failure to obtain sufficient antistatic properties whereas even exceeding 3.0 parts by weight results in no improvement in the antistatic effect and conversely causes the progress of crystallization deterioration of materials and the like to lower the antistatic effect. As a compounding method of metal salt B to component J it is possible to directly mix metal salt B with the resin by melt mixing or dry blend mixing when the content of metal salt B is as small as 0.01 to 2.5 parts by weight. However when the content of metal salt B is increased the variation in the dispersibility in the resin sometimes becomes wide. It is therefore desirable to use the metal salt previously dissolved in the compound C mentioned below or the like.

1 1 Composition of the present invention is the antistatic composition that the above mentioned first composition further contains C an organic compound which has an O AO group A represents an alkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms and n represents an integer of 1 to 7 and all molecular chain terminals of which are CHand or CHgroups.

Component C of the present invention is an organic compound which has an O AO group A represents an alkylene group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms and n represents an integer of 1 to 7 and all molecular chain terminals of which are CHand or CHgroups. The above mentioned CHgroups at the molecular chain terminals have carbon atoms linked by double bonds.

The molecular chain terminals of the component C of the present invention are blocked by CHand or CHgroups. Therefore the component C can ionize lithium above mentioned component B selectively. The bleeding out doesn t happen easily when the component C is used because the component C has the above mentioned structure.

The above mentioned component C has the effect on improvements in solubility and dissociation stability of the metal salt in the composition of the present invention.

As a compounding method of metal salt B to component A and J it is possible to directly mix metal salt B with the resin by melt mixing or dry blend mixing when the content of metal salt B is as small as 0.01 to 2.5 parts by weight.

The ratio of component K contained in the 3 2 composition is from 3 to 80 parts by weight and preferably from 5 to 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total of components B C L and J . When the ratio of component K contained is less than 3 parts by weight the dimensional stability is poor resulting in unsuitability for a precision formed article.

In the component L containing composition of the present invention the third composition 3 1 3 2 and 3 3 composition a cation of component B can easily move in the composition so that the ionic conductivity is extremely high to exhibit excellent antistatic properties. Further a solution comprising component B and component C is excellent in dispersibility and compatibility so that the occurrence of the bleeding out on a surface of a formed article can be inhibited to maintain the excellent antistatic properties for a long period of time.

Further the component L containing composition of the present invention can also be easily colored by adding a pigment as a coloring agent. As the above mentioned pigments there are exemplified inorganic pigments such as talc titanium oxide iron oxide red clay silica white and calcium carbonate organic pigments such as an azo dye a phthalocyanine dye and carbon black and the like. The constitution of the present invention has the advantages of excellent thermal stability and no impairment of physical properties of a substrate resin.

In the present composition from first to 3 3 composition when component C is contained the amount of component B is from 0.1 to 30 parts by weight and preferably from 1 to 25 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total of component C .

When the ratio is less than 0.1 by weight the antistatic properties are not sufficiently exhibited. On the other hand exceeding 50 by weight results in saturation of the effect of imparting the antistatic properties which causes an economical disadvantage.

The antistatic composition of the present invention from the first composition to the 3 3 composition can contain additives such as a stabilizer a coloring agent a plasticizer a dispersing agent an ultraviolet absorber an antioxidant a flame retardant a stabilizer a reinforcing agent a lubricant a foaming agent a weather light resistant agent and a metal powder as long as the purpose of the invention is not impaired.

When the antistatic composition of the present invention has biodegradability it Is preferred that a polymer material and an organic additive arbitrarily added have biodegradable characteristics or are harmless to the natural world. For example the polymers include a microorganism derived polyester polycaprolactone polylactic acid modified starch a polyesteramide and the like. An organic material based lubricant a metal salt stabilizer such as calcium a glycol based or fatty acid based wax petroleum based wax and the like can also be added. As the coloring agent there can be used iron oxide red carbon black titanium oxide or the like and as the inorganic filler there can also be used a special filler such as barium sulfate or a metal powder as well as natural ore derived calcium carbonate talc mica calcium silicate silica or the like. Almost all fillers are generally harmless and can be suitably added according to the purpose.

In addition to the above mentioned fillers it is also possible to blend purified pulp starch wood powder chaff and the like as natural fillers according to the purpose. These organic inorganic and natural fillers not only enhance the biodegradable function but also are effective for cost reduction of relatively expensive biodegradable resins.

As the coloring agents used in the compositions of the present invention all are available as long as they are ones used as coloring agents for synthetic resins. However in applications intended for biodegradation biodegradable coloring agents or ones low in toxicity when only the coloring agents remain after degradation are preferred.

Particularly preferred examples of the coloring agents include a food dye and an inorganic pigment. As the food dye there is available an aluminum lake dye such as red No. 2 No. 3 or No. 40 for food dye yellow No. 4 or No. 5 for food dye green No. 3 for food dye blue No. 1 or No. 2 for food dye or the like. Furthermore as the inorganic pigment there is available titanium oxide iron oxide red ultramarine blue or the like.

Although these coloring agents may be used alone two or more of them are usually combined thereby being able to mix colors to a desired color tone.

The use of these coloring agents provides formed articles of respective colors which make it possible to identify the formed articles.

The composition of the present invention is preliminarily mixed and melt kneaded and can be used as a pelletized compound which is an ordinary fabrication material form. The pellet processing allows the respective components to uniformly preliminarily disperse thereby being able to obtain stability as a polymer characteristic.

As preliminary mixers used in the processing of the pelletized compounds there are used blenders for the purposes of preliminary dispersion distribution and diffusion mixing. Typical examples of the lenders include a ribbon blender a Henschel mixer super mixer a tumbler mixer a tumble mixer an air blender and the like. These preliminary mixers are selected according to the plasticizer to be filled the form of a supplementary material and the level of diffusion. Further the respective compounding materials may each be put in a melt kneader using different quantitative cutting out devices such as Brabender or different quantitative liquid addition devices respectively without using the preliminary mixer.

The antistatic compositions of the present invention can be produced without problems using ordinary devices and equipment used for mixing and kneading of usual thermoplastic resins. As an extruder favorable is a single screw kneading extruder equipped with a vent or twin screw kneading extruder equipped with a vent of which screws rotate in the same direction or opposite directions. Further in place of the extruder a kneader such as a super mixer a Banbury mixer a kneader a tumbler and a co kneader may be used.

The melt extruders generally include a single screw extruder a twin screw extruder a Banbury type a roll type and the like. Also for these it is possible to produce the pelletized starting material by selecting them according to the form and purpose of the composition and productivity followed by melt kneading.

Further the composition of the present invention can also be used as a powder type obtained by dry blending of the compounding materials it is also possible to produce a starting material of a powder type mixture by dry blending using the preliminary mixer used in the processing of the above mentioned pelletized compound.

Furthermore the composition of the present invention may be one obtained by using a pelletized compound as a master batch which is obtained by melt kneading parts of the above mentioned various polymers components B and J as essential element component A and L may be added and another constituent component such as component C and K as needed and mixing it with the remaining polymer components. For example in preparing the first composition a master batch in which component B is previously added to component J mixed with component remainder J or L further other component such as component C and or K are able to added as needed.

Using the composition of the present invention all forming methods can be applied. That is to say in forming articles the composition is melted with each forming machine and forming processing by various forming machines such as extrusion forming including contour extrusion injection forming blow forming calender forming vacuum forming and emboss forming is possible. As the typical forming machines for injection forming extrusion forming and the like ones having ordinary specifications generally used can be employed.

In the antistatic composition of the present invention the form of the composition is generally pelletized. However on the ground that component C is usually a liquid a method of directly adding it to the melt kneader without passing it through the preliminary mixer may be used.

For example in the case of injection forming it is possible to use an ordinary injection forming machine. In general the use of the pelletized compound provides a good finish of a formed article and a stable physical performance.

When aliphatic polyesters is used as component A it is necessary to pay attention to moisture absorption of the starting materials in all forming processing procedures and preliminary drying and measures against the moisture absorption during forming are important. Insufficient drying causes foaming of a melt composition resulting in the deterioration of the appearance and mechanical characteristics of a formed article. Further there is also a fear of the deteriorated appearance of a formed article due to a fall inviscosity byhydrolysis. When the film like formed article is manufactured from antistatic composition of present invention 0.3 percent by weight or less of the content of water is preferable.

It is desirable to conduct preliminary drying by either method of a hot air type and a vacuum type before forming and to prevent moisture absorption with a hopper dryer or the like during forming.

The antistatic compositions of the present invention can be suitably used for the antistatic measures of the above mentioned machine parts automotive parts sports goods office automation equipment the home electric appliance field the electric and electronic fields other various parts packages tubes coverings and the like making use of their excellent characteristics.
