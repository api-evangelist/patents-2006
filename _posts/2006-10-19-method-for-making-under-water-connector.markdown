title: Method for making under water connector
abstract: A method for sealing an electrical connector having a transition end and a cable. A protective coating is applied to the transition end of the connector. The connector, transition end and cable are positioned within halves of a mold. An annular resilient seal is positioned about the transition end within the mold. When the mold is filed with castable material the annular resilient seal compresses against the connector, preventing leakage of the castable material along the connector. The mold can then be separated leaving a waterproof boot formed on the transition end of the connector. The invention also provides a mold and sealing means for this process.

The present invention relates generally to underwater connectors. More particularly this invention relates to an improvement for underwater connectors having a flexible boot bonded onto a non conductive electrical connector that reliably seals the interface between the boot and connector to assure long term reliable operation.

Referring to prior art multi pin electrical connectors have connector housings that are typically made from a conductive metal such as aluminum or stainless steel. Multi pin electrical connector can connect to an electrical cable having a number of electrical conductors only one of which is shown in in an end portion having a collar like threaded nut or other securing device to engage a correspondingly shaped threaded section in electrical fitting . Each electrical conductor is secured to pin that is sized to slide into a mating sleeve in fitting to complete an electrical interconnection when nut is tightened onto section . At least one O ring on end portion creates a seal between connector and an internal bore in fitting .

In many uses an electrically nonconductive and corrosion resistant protective coating measuring about 0.0010 0.005 inches thick is applied to housing of connector by spraying on coating . A protective coating can be applied on fitting as well.

However protective coating on housing can be formed with irregular surfaces as a consequence of imperfections of the spraying application technique. Irregular surfaces can also be created on housing as a consequence imperfections in the manufacturing process of connector .

These irregular surfaces in coating on housing can be troublesome in connectors particularly where housing has an annular shaped transition end extending outside of an electrical cable . Electrical cable can extend from connector through water to connect transducers or other sensors not shown to fitting that can act as an electrical hull penetrator outboard of the pressurized hull of a Navy submarine for example. A waterproof boot is molded about transition end of connector housing and electrical cable .

Waterproof boot is the mechanical transition to the outer jacket of electrical cable and is made from a sealing casting material that cures into boot . Boot has a flexible waterproof form that resists sharp bending of cable where it enters and is secured to connector by an internal lock nut not shown . Casting material is typically a synthetic rubber such as silicone Neoprene or the like having the properties of being waterproof and tough with sufficient flexibility etc. for reliable operation in the demanding marine environment. Boot bonds to an outer surface A and an inner surface B of transition end . Boot contacts outer surface A at an annular interface an annular tapered part provides a transition.

Referring now to boot is molded by positioning two halves of a mold to define a casting cavity to contain transition end of connector housing and cable . Casting chamber of mold is coated with a suitable release agent not shown to allow removal of boot after it has cured. Mold has a cable end A positionable about outer jacket of electrical cable and a connector end B positionable about part of connector . Only the bottom half of rigid mold is shown it being understood that the mirror image top half of mold is placed over and tightly secured to bottom half to define casting cavity for waterproof boot . Mold is then filled with a liquid form of casting material via a open ended filling cavity at cable end A that is in communication with casting cavity . Casting material sets or cures into waterproof boot . See . 

Casting cavity is shaped to define waterproof boot and forms a boot termination shoulder A for shoulder of boot toward connector end B of mold . An O ring groove C is adjacent boot termination shoulder A to receive an O ring D and a connector shoulder cavity E is by inward flange F at connector end B of mold .

During the casting procedure of waterproof boot in mold filling cavity faces upward and connector has a shoulder against inward flange F in connector shoulder cavity E and has transition end fitted into O ring D to hold and prevent leakage of liquid casting material. The other half not shown of mold is fitted so that O ring D is positioned to annularly coextend in the other half of termination shoulder O ring groove C. Mold is then filled with liquid sealing casting material.

Casting material of boot bonds or adheres to outer jacket of electrical cable along the length of cable covered by boot in a watertight sealed relationship and this bonding prevents any leaking of ambient water along the juncture between outer jacket and boot . However water can and does leak into connector due to imperfections or unevenness of protective coating on transition end of housing .

Leakage of water compromises reliable operation of connector due to irregularities in protective coating on transition end of housing . These irregularities are exposed to ambient water at an annular interface on transition end near the center of housing at the end of waterproof boot . Leakage of water at annular interface is likely to occur because of imperfections of application of coating . Water which has leaked through annular interface seeps under annular tapered part of boot and to the left along annular interface between boot and along the top A of transition end . Next leaked water goes back to the right toward fitting between boot and along the bottom B of transition end and onward into connector to disrupt reliable operation of its other internal constituents.

Thus in accordance with this inventive concept a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a cost effective improvement for underwater connectors that prevents water leakages attributable to irregularities in protective coatings.

Another object of the invention is to provide an underwater connector preventing water leakages attributable to irregularities in the surfaces of housings and protective coatings thereon.

Another object is to provide a method of making an underwater connector preventing water leakages attributable to irregularities in the surfaces of housings and protective coatings thereon.

These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.

Accordingly the present invention is A method for sealing an electrical connector having a transition end and a cable. A protective coating is applied to the transition end of the connector. The connector transition end and cable are positioned within halves of a mold. An annular resilient seal is positioned about the transition end within the mold. When the mold is filed with castable material the annular resilient seal compresses against the connector preventing leakage of the castable material along the connector. The mold can then be separated leaving a waterproof boot formed on the transition end of the connector. The invention also provides a mold and sealing means for this process.

Referring to in accordance with this invention an annular resilient seal is used to provide a better sealing interface between boot and transition end blocking leakage of water that would otherwise compromise reliable operation of metal electrical connector . Electrical connector has an electrically conductive metal housing receiving an electrical cable . In all visible details electrical connector is the same as that described in .

An electrically nonconductive and corrosion resistant protective coating measuring about 0.0010 0.005 inches thick is applied to housing of connector by spraying on the coating. Like protective coating described with respect to the prior art above irregular surfaces can be formed in the protective coating on housing due to imperfections of the spraying application technique. Irregular surfaces can also be created on housing as a consequence imperfections in the manufacturing process of connector . These irregular surfaces can cause failure of connector on an annular shaped transition end of connector housing that extends outside of electrical cable .

A modified waterproof boot of the invention is molded about transition end of connector housing and electrical cable in a mold to resist sharp bending of cable where it enters connector housing . Mold utilizes an annular resilient seal for obtaining better sealing of mold against connector as provided hereinafter.

Annular resilient seal has an essentially triangular cross sectional configuration and is made from a soft elastomeric composition. Annular resilient seal should be made from a soft elastomeric heat resistant material. Seal should be sufficiently pliable to seal against mold and sufficiently heat resistant to withstand the curing temperature of the material used to form boot . Annular resilient seal is cast in two virtually identical semicircular parts from a liquid casting material. Annular resilient seal has an outwardly extending annular rim an inwardly extending annular rim an annular inclined surface reaching between rims and and an annular groove next to rim . Groove is formed between rim and an inward flange of mold to receive an o ring . Annular resilient seal presents an effective barrier for castable material that is being cast in the mold as it pliably accommodates irregular surfaces of protective coating on annular shaped transition ends . Annular inclined surface of annular resilient seal acts as a molding surface for watertight boot .

Modified waterproof boot is molded by securing two virtually identical halves of a rigid mold together to define a casting cavity to contain transition end of connector housing and cable . Casting cavity of mold is coated with a suitable release agent not shown to allow removal of boot after it has cured. The first half of mold depicted in detail it being understood that the second half of mold is virtually the same has a cable end A positioned about electrical cable and a connector end B positioned about transition end of connector . Each half of mold has a semicircular groove in connector end B to receive and retain annular outer rim of one half of annular resilient seal to create boot casting cavity in mold for molding waterproof boot around transition end and cable . Casting cavity is filled with casting material in a liquid form and having properties as described above via an open ended filling cavity in cable end A.

Mold is oriented to have filling cavity facing upward so that liquid casting material completely fills boot casting cavity and sets or cures into waterproof boot . During casting of boot casting cavity is shaped to place or flow a liquid inclined end portion A of liquid casting material until inclined end surface B bears against all of annular inclined surface of annular resilient seal . O ring in groove resiliently engages transition end of connector to prevent leakage of liquid casting material into other parts of connector .

The weight of liquid casting material in mold exerts a downward force on inclined end portion A against annular inclined surface that can slightly deform annular resilient seal . Groove in connector end B of mold receives rim and retains annular resilient seal in its axial position within mold . At least part of the force from inclined end surface B to inclined surface is transferred through annular resilient seal to rim . Because the innermost annular surface A of rim contacts coating with its irregularities the soft resilient material of annular resilient seal is slightly resiliently deformed radially inward and pliably accommodates the irregular contours of irregularities to create a positive seal in a sealed annular region along annular sealing surface.

Liquid casting material is typically cured at a temperature dependent on the material used. When liquid casting material of boot cures and sets it bonds or adheres to outer jacket of electrical cable along the length of cable covered by boot in a watertight sealed relationship. This bonding prevents any leaking of ambient water along the juncture between outer jacket and boot . When the curing and setting process is complete the mold halves are separated and the connector cable and boot are removed. Annular resilient seal is retained with mold where it can be reused.

The components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Mold utilized with resilient annular seal of this invention provides a reliable and cost effective means to assure long term operation of electrical interconnections in the harsh marine environment. Therefore mold utilized with resilient annular seal as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting but rather is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
