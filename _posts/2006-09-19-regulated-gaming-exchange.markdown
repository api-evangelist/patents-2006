The subject matter of the present application is related to the subject matter of commonly assigned and co pending patent application entitled Regulated Gaming Compartmented Freelance Code Atty. Docket No. CYBS6004A and is also related to the subject matter of commonly assigned and co pending patent application entitled Regulated Virtual Display Atty. Docket No. CYBS6004B each application of which is being filed on even date herewith.

This invention relates generally to the field of regulated pay computer controlled games either games of skills or games of chance and more particularly to the field of integrating certifying and downloading games developed by multi parties and of building relationships between players and game operators to promote the games.

Presently game regulation essentially considers a slot machine as a standalone piece of equipment supplied entirely by a single vendor e.g. IGT WMS Bally . Although standards now allow for some vendor interoperability between peripheral devices e.g. hopper bill accepter ticket printer and a central accounting system e.g. IGT GSA SAS Standard Accounting System protocol a slot machine as delivered comprises essentially proprietary components developed and manufactured by a single supplier. In particular game regulators have made no attempt to adapt their standards to enable the suppliers to leverage on the extraordinary multimedia capabilities of the PC platform and the advances in distributed network security. Consequently the operating system and game software controlling a slot machine are proprietary and almost entirely developed by the supplier s software programmers such as to meet regulatory requirements that are out of sync with main stream computing. It is worrying to see that current gaming regulation leaves no choice to the suppliers but to modify the source code of their operating system e.g. Linux . This prevents them from continually benefiting from security peer review and from associated security upgrades developed by operating system experts. Consequently the operating system of such gaming machines is considerably weakened and fractured exposing the suppliers and game operators to stealth and focused hacking attacks.

It is reasonable to believe that sooner or later the standards formulated by the Trusted Computer Group TCG to secure distributed computer network will be adopted by game regulators. Therefore well architectured and security hardened commercial multimedia operating systems may be used by slot machine vendors without needing to hack the kernel source code.

As an immediate result of adopting industry security standards the vendors may allocate more resources to develop more attractive games and enable their download from a central system. However present game regulation is such that the entire game software may only be developed by the slot supplier himself thus significantly impeding suppliers from offering games inspired or derived from the best of breed and phenomenally popular game titles available on Xbox and PlayStation or other games developed by freelance game developers. It is unlikely that the culture inside a slot manufacturer s game software engineering department would ever attract creative minds to create games on par with what is and will be available in the main stream gaming arena.

The path for freelance game development companies that would be looking at introducing their games and game technologies into the highly regulated casino marketplace has traditionally been a narrow and tortuous one. Historically such companies have held only three real options a to partner with an established casino game manufacturer such as IGT Bally or WMS b to sell their designs to an established game manufacturer or c to attempt to create their own casino game manufacturing company. All of these paths are difficult to tread. For example large legacy gaming companies have their own game creation studio fully staffed with trained artists and trained software developers. As such they are generally reluctant to introduce truly visionary game designs into their gaming libraries as they have achieved a longstanding history of profitability with more conservative games revolving essentially around boring fruit machine like games poker games and secondary games such as Wheel of Fortune and Mystery Jackpot.

A further limitation of the existing casino gaming marketplace is that game developers looking to start their own casino game manufacturing companies face several key obstacles the most important of which being the lengthy and prohibitively expensive regulatory process that must be navigated to gain even a precarious foothold in the casino gaming market.

Most of all and sadly enough there is no dialog between the game regulators and innovative gaming companies that would otherwise enter the regulated gaming market. This is because such innovative gaming companies most often do not have the coveted game license which is required in every state. Therefore promising freelance game development companies such as those developing dazzling games for console type platforms such as the Xbox and PlayStation for example or those developing PC based games that would be looking at introducing variants of their games into the highly regulated casino marketplace are in effect completely shut out. Indeed the dazzling graphics rendered in such games rely upon constantly evolving PC and game console hardware and software technologies including operating systems such as Microsoft Windows XP and forthcoming Vista. To their defense the attitude of gaming regulators is understandable as these game technologies are not well adapted for the highly regulated gaming environment mainly because of security issues.

The Gaming Standard Association GSA is not helping the situation as it is formed by members that are in majority representatives of the influential established casino game manufacturers that have little interest in changing whatsoever. The gaming certification labs that are subcontracted by equipment suppliers to test and certify that their equipment meets applicable game regulation do indeed set gaming standards. These gaming certification labs also do not attempt to assume a leadership role to adapt their standards to lay the foundations on which new computer technologies could meet the security standards for the regulated gaming market. For these reasons the progress that has been achieved in general computer security has gone largely unnoticed and innovative gaming companies are still barred from offering innovative gaming technologies. The legacy game manufacturers stranglehold on casino gaming has excluded visionary game designers from fully participating in this market and has prevented game operators from offering the public the best possible games.

In is an object of the present invention to enable freelance game developers to offer dazzling electronic games to the regulated casino gaming marketplace. It is another object of the present invention to ensure that the freelance game developers receive compensation that is commensurate with the success of their games. A still further object of the present invention is to provide game operators with timely information to enable them to tailor their regulated game offerings based on demand and or popularity of identical trial games that use only simulated money and that are made available to the public over an Internet portal. It is a further object of the present invention to provide players with the location of the casinos offering their favorite game s for playing with real money together with the promotions offered if any. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide game operators with the contact information of the players and their list of favorite trial games to enable them to offer incentives and to attract them to their casino. Another object of the present invention is to offer freelance game developers a method for developing integrating licensing tags testing and certifying secure downloadable electronic games such that an unprecedented generation of advanced electronic games may be offered to players in casinos on a relatively short timetable.

It is another object of the invention to offer players operators licensed developers and freelance developers search means to query the regulated gaming exchange and obtain results structured according to the formulated query and related results popularity ratings most often requested queries general promotional offers and specifically targeted promotional offers for example .

In is another object of the present invention to offer the freelance game developers a compartmented architecture for developing integrating licensing tags testing and certifying secure downloadable electronic games such that an unprecedented generation of dazzling electronic games may be offered to players in regulated gaming places on a relatively short timetable. In is a further object of the present invention to ensure that the freelance game developers receive compensation based on the success of their games.

Accordingly an embodiment of the present invention is compartmented system architecture and associated methods for enabling freelance game developers to a integrate their game software together with the gaming manufacturer software and b tag their software such as to receive compensation based on the success of their games. The combined tagged freelance software and gaming manufacturer software may rapidly pass through certification testing and be downloaded overnight to a large number of gaming machines such as to offer players in casinos an unprecedented choice of new generation electronic games within a relatively short timetable.

Compartmenting for totally isolating the graphics rich freelance and outcome free code from the slot supplier and outcome determining code is obtained according to an embodiment of the present invention by adopting a blue screening paradigm wherein the freelance code executes in a process sandbox and renders its entertainment outcome free graphics in a totally isolated background display plane while the slot supplier code renders its accounting graphics and outcome graphics in a foreground display plane as small graphics gadgets over a neutral plane. The foreground and background display planes are mixed together using the pervasive blue screening paradigm used in TV studio programs and foreground moving outcome graphics gadgets are synchronized in real time with the moving outcome free background graphics.

The entertainment outcome free graphics background A and the synchronized moving outcome graphics gadgets foreground B is best understood using a horse racing game as an example. The horse racing animation may be rendered in a background plane by the freelance code executing in a process sandbox using pre recorded video or realistic real time 3D animation. The rendering is such that each horse number indicia usually printed on the horse s saddle blanket is totally obfuscated or otherwise obscured. Consequently it impossible when watching the rendered horse race to determine which horse is leading and will likely win the race and what the order of the other horses will be across the finish line. In addition other features that may help in identifying the horse such as the jockey s jacket color and horse skin color may also be obfuscated. Moreover the voice over or sound may not give any indication of the leading horses. Thus the background plane may constitute a dazzling entertaining scene complete with realistic sound of hooves and cheering crowds that is free from any markings i.e. numbers colors shapes that would reveal or otherwise suggest the outcome of the race.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the horse or other race or entrant or team player number indicia which gives an indication of the outcome of the game may be rendered in a foreground plane as graphic gadgets by the certified slot supplier code executing in a process sandbox isolated from the uncertified freelance process running in another sandbox. In addition according to embodiments of the present invention the motion displacement and animation of each graphic gadget is synchronized with the freelance background such that each graphic gadget is rendered over a predetermined target in the horse race example developed herein a predetermined horse saddle blanket . The combined background and foreground scene then gives the viewer the capability to identify the leading horses. Similarly the jockey s jacket colors horses true color and other features may be rendered in the same synchronized manner. A game outcome process seeded by a random number generator may provide the graphics gadgets with the random numbers that will be used to render the random indicia on the horse saddle blanket.

The motion synchronization of outcome gadgets over the associated obfuscated area in the outcome free animation background scene may be carried out according to embodiments of the present invention via pre computed trajectory paths or frame by frame. The motion synchronization may utilize without limitation one or more of the following technologies and or methods a 2D trajectory path a 3D trajectory path location scale rotation velocity and or camera angle for example. The computer processing and rendering of the outcome free animation background e.g. an XBOX or other game console or a PC may be separate from the slot machine controller e.g. a PC processing the game outcome and rendering the outcome gadgets. A dual ported video mixer may combine the outcome free animation background and the outcome graphic gadgets the motion synchronization being carried out a via a suitable direct interface between the two computers using remote procedure call RPC Microsoft .NET Remoting for example or an IP service or b by real time image analysis and tracking under the control of the slot machine supplier software using the motion capture paradigm used in cinematography for example. The dual ported video mixer may be a custom ASIC.

The graphic gadget may render the horse number and other outcome related features using direct a 2D polyline bezier draw and color fill b triangles and color fill and or c texturing. Path location scaling rotation 2D projection illumination sources and other viewing attributes may be provided directly by the freelance software through a secure interface or may be derived from the freelance graphics by motion capture and capture of other scene attributes. Other overlay rendering technique may be used. Rendering of an outcome onto a 2D target is called hereafter a 2D outcome asset. 

An embodiment of the invention includes a freelance software that exposes through a secure interface a neutral 3D animated geometry via a surface NURBS curves or other 3D modeling technique on which the graphic gadget would project a 3D skin. Rendering of an outcome onto a 3D target is hereafter called a 3D outcome asset. For example the freelance software may expose a neutral sphere located in space together with scale and rotation attributes and the graphic gadget may render a skin projection representing the planet earth the moon mars or any other planet as determined by a game outcome. A given planet in this example would be 3D asset. Similarly the freelance software may expose a cavity surface located in space together with scale rotation etc. . . . in which the gadget may render a 3D fruit such as a cherry a strawberry a banana etc. as determined by a game outcome. A given fruit is a 3D asset. Rendering a skin over a surface is commonly practiced in 3D modeling for industrial design refer to www.rhino3d.com for example.

Other video assets such as the accounting meters may be controlled and rendered by the slot machine supplier software. Interactive video assets having a role in the outcome determination such as wager selections line selection chip selection and the bet button may also be controlled and rendered by the slot machine supplier software. Graphic gadgets may be used to render the accounting meters and the interactive video assets and to activate the interactive video assets.

The rendering of all the animated outcome graphic gadgets may be controlled by a space controller ensuring that they appears at the proper location with the proper viewing attributes for a seamless integration with the dazzling entertainment background.

For each bet session the identifiers of all the associated outcome assets together with their paths and viewing attributes as well as the identifier of the background animation may be recorded such that a playback of the complete bet session may be replayed. This may be used for dispute resolution during a player complaint.

The freelance binary code may execute in a process sandbox and may render its entertainment outcome free graphics in a totally isolated background video plane. The software code that is responsible for producing the game outcome and rendering the game outcome assets is totally under the control of the slot supplier and may not be interfered with by unauthorized processes. Consequently the freelance code need not be subjected to a full regulatory certification cycle in which traditionally the entire source code is submitted to the lab examined compiled and tested according to stringent test cases. The freelance code may be classified similarly to a commercial operating system that is not subjected to full regulatory certification cycle.

The present Regulated Gaming Exchange or Gaming Exchange Portal enables freelance game developers to offer new and dazzling electronic games to the regulated gaming marketplace and to receive compensation based on the success of their games. The games may be available as an unregulated trial download that allows wagering using only simulated or virtual money. Operators of regulated gaming machines may also download regulated versions of the same games from the Regulated Gaming Exchange for execution on regulated gaming machines. Usage metrics may be collected to determine the popularity of the unregulated trial games. The regulated gaming exchange may include a first repository that is selectively accessible to home players over a computer network and a second repository that is selectively available over the computer network to operators of regulated gaming machines. The first repository may store an unregulated first version of a game that is configured for game play on a home computing device such as a computer or gaming console for example. The unregulated first version of the game may be uncertified by a gaming software certification laboratory and may include a first outcome free game portion and a first outcome bearing game portion. The unregulated first version of the game is configured according to embodiments of the present invention to enable wagering only with virtual money.

The second repository may store a regulated second version of the game that is configured for game play on a regulated gaming machine and that is certified by the gaming software certification laboratory. The regulated second version of the game may include a second outcome free game portion and a second outcome bearing game portion. In contrast to the first version of the game the second version of the game being may be configured to enable wagering with real money. The second outcome free game portion may be substantially identical to the first outcome free game portion.

The regulated gaming Exchange portal may include search functionalities enabling players freelance developers or game operators to formulate and receive answers for their search queries. A master index of information within the Regulated Gaming Exchange Portal may be generated to offer search results in a speedy manner. For example some of the information that may be indexed may include game attributes such as the game type e.g. fruit type X poker type Y etc. . . . the game theme e.g. English Chinese Christmas Easter Birthday Marriage beginner advanced etc. the return to player RTP factor e.g. 92 94 98 the denomination e.g. 1 5 10 50 1 10 50 and the volatility e.g. high low medium that is win small amounts frequently or win larger amounts less often . In addition to usage metrics the statistics may be kept on the frequency of download for each game and the geographic distribution of such downloads.

Advertising sensing technology may be implemented in the Regulated Gaming Exchange to enable game operators and freelance developers to display relevant ads on their content pages to offer home players an opportunity to follow links to examine casino promotions and freelance full size unregulated version of the games. The history of the queries of each player combined with their usage metrics may be analyzed to derive intelligence therefrom relative to their preferences to enable the ads and associated links to be tailored to the players.

Accordingly an embodiment of the present invention is a method of developing and distributing a game. The method may include steps of developing a first outcome free game portion developing a first outcome bearing game portion that is configured to enable waging using only virtual money and that is associated with the developed first outcome free game portion merging the first outcome free game portion and the first outcome bearing game portion to obtain an unregulated first version of the game a first making step to make the unregulated first version of the game available for download to at least one home computing device developing a second outcome free game portion that is substantially identical to the first outcome free game portion developing a second outcome bearing game portion that is configured to enable wagering using real money and that is associated with the developed second outcome free game portion merging the second outcome free game portion and the second outcome bearing game portion to obtain a regulated second version of the game to be submitted to a gaming software certification laboratory obtaining certification of the regulated second version of the game from the gaming software certification laboratory and a second making step to make the regulated second version of the game available for download into at least one regulated gaming machine.

Reference will now be made in detail to the construction and operation of preferred implementations of the present invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The following description of the preferred implementations of the present invention is only exemplary of the invention. The present invention is not limited to these implementations but may be realized by other implementations.

Keeping the foregoing in mind according to an embodiment of the invention a horse racing graphic animation which may be and or include for example a video playback controlled by a process may be rendered in a video plane . The animation scene in includes four horses and . The horse racing animation may be rendered in a video plane by the freelance code executing in a process sandbox using pre recorded video or realistic real time 3D animation the rendering being such that each horse number indicia usually printed on a blanket and attached to the saddle is totally obfuscated. Consequently it is impossible from viewing the animation of the freelance code to know or otherwise determine which horse is leading and will eventually win the race as well as the order of the other horses across the finish line. In addition other identifying features that may help in identifying horses such as the jockey s jacket color and the horse s color or other identifying markings for example may also be obfuscated. Moreover the voice over or sound should not give any indication of the leading horses. Thus the background plane may constitute a dazzling entertaining scene that is free from any markings i.e. numbers colors shapes that would reveal the outcome of the game together with realistic sound.

A process sandbox is a term commonly employed in computer technology to denote that the running process is given restricted memory access and restricted execution permissions such as not to interfere with other resources e.g. processes memory disk storage video etc. . . . outside defined boundaries. The process sandbox technique is also commonly known in the US army software requirement as secure compartmenting for a multilevel secure operating system as defined in the DoD 5200.28 STD standard and the associated Orange book and the rainbow series. The process sandbox technique is being further researched at Microsoft Research under the Singularities and Virtualization initiatives wherein Software Isolated Processes SIPs communicate and interact via channels and contracts which provide a fully defined and protected security partitioning for inter process communication and wherein virtualization of the Windows operating system will be controlled by the HyperVisor virtualization engine these technologies are likely to be released after Windows Vista. The process sandbox technique is also commonly referred as strong process isolation . This may be achieved using advanced and secure resource management such as but not limited to hardware enforced memory management ACL Access Control List trusted computing base i.e. implementing security initiatives of the TCG Trusted Computing Group TPM TNC secure BIOS secure storage etc. . . . or equivalent technologies software restriction policy anti virus kernel virtualization I O virtualization and other security mechanisms embedded in advanced 64 bit CPU. In addition forthcoming graphics controllers comprising embedded hardware security module may ensure that no process may access unauthorized video resources. Consequently the executing freelance software cannot interfere with the regulated software installed or executing on the gaming controller including unauthorized writing and reading of information to from the video display and hidden video display cache.

Accordingly and according to an embodiment of the present invention the outcome free game software or processes may be configured to execute in a first process sandbox in which it is given compartmented memory access and or compartmented execution permissions. The outcome free game software or processes may be configured to execute in a first process sandbox that may include for example strong process isolation DoD 5200.28 STD multilevel security Microsoft Software Isolation Process SIP and or JAVA sandbox. Likewise the outcome providing game software or processes may be configured to execute in a second process sandbox in which it is given compartmented memory access and or compartmented execution permissions. For example the outcome providing game software may be configured to execute in a second process sandbox that may include for example process isolation DoD 5200.28 STD multilevel security Microsoft Software Isolation Process SIP and or JAVA sandbox.

As shown in the horse number indicia and may be generated by an outcome engine process seeded by a random number generator RNG subsequent to the BET button being pressed. The code for the outcome engine process is under the control of the slot supplier and is certified in contradistinction from the executing freelance code which need not be certified or under the control of the slot supplier. Note that the freelance code may in fact originate from the slot supplier. This would in effect streamline the slot supplier s software certification process as only the relatively lean code for the outcome engine process need be submitted to the certification lab for certification as this is the only code that is in any way involved in the outcome of the game.

The horse number indicia may be rendered in a video plane as graphic gadgets in the exemplary embodiment shown in horse numbers controlled by the certified slot supplier code executing in a process sandbox isolated from the uncertified freelance process running in another sandbox. Graphic gadgets according to embodiments of the present invention are small graphic objects behaving much like small windows that may be rendered and moved individually over a background scene. However graphics gadgets are not necessary limited to a rectangular shape. Graphic gadgets may be circular for rendering a clock for example and of arbitrary outline. Other shapes for such graphic gadgets are possible. Graphic gadgets may also be semi transparent using alpha blending technology and may have a controllable transparency. Furthermore graphic gadgets may be 3D animated graphic objects and thus the outline of the 3D object over the background scene may be cut in real time accordingly. The term graphics gadget is used herein to emphasize the fact that the controlling process behind the graphics gadget is structured to be isolated by a process sandbox and a corresponding video sandbox the video sandbox ensuring that a the gadget cannot be hidden or overlapped by an unauthorized process trying to write to the display or the video cache and that b an unauthorized process cannot read the display or the video cache of the graphics gadget such as to determine the outcome that is rendered.

As may be apparent to those of skill in the art of video graphics animation and synchronization other synchronization schemes may be employed that rely on a direct programming interface either frame by frame by sequence of frames or for the entire animation sequence. For example if the animation is a replay of a pre recorded animation the overall path for each target may be provided via the programming interface.

The outcome gadgets may display outcome bearing information such as but not limited to identification marks numerals shapes and colors. The meters gadgets may display the meters of the games such as but not limited to credit last win and denomination. The interaction gadgets may be the visible or invisible graphic objects with which the player may interact such as but not limited to a bet button wager selection denomination selection lines selection chips help button and cash out button. Help and prize matrix may be interaction gadgets.

The graphics objects and gadgets may be displayed anywhere on the video display s of the gaming machine with any viewing attributes such as location scale orientation illumination one or several light sources opacity and plane position on top in back in between etc. . Gadgets may be rendered in rectangular or non rectangular windows or in sprites. Gadgets may be rendered as full 3D animated objects.

The display rendering of all the gadgets on the video display is controlled by a space controller that is configured to coordinate all the 2D 3D viewing attributes of each of the graphic objects and gadgets such as to enable the player to experience a seamless game session. Hereafter the 2D 3D viewing attribute of each gadget or graphic object is referenced as path and in . The path of each gadget may be controlled frame by frame by aggregate of frames or for the entire viewing sequence whichever is more appropriate for each gadget. The space controller may receive the outcome data from the outcome engine and forward the outcome information together with the path to each of the associated outcome gadgets that will in turn render the graphic animation of the outcome in synchronization with the game entertainment scene. The outcome engine may receive the wager size bet selections and bet activation as a command message from the interaction gadgets.

The presentation style or skin of the entertainment gadgets meter gadgets and the interaction gadgets may be customized by the player and or by the game operator without requiring any regulatory software re testing. The customization available to the players and or to the game operator is limited to remain in regulatory compliance. Young computer users and gamers who are used to be provided with skin able programs and games such as music players and even the entire Microsoft Windows visual appearance i.e. Aero in Windows Vista may therefore customize the skin of all the display windows and gadgets entertainment meters interactive and choose their size location opacity and dynamic zoom in zoom out the meters may be visible in small size or with high transparency during game action and may appear in large size and high opacity when the outcome is given . The gadgets may be dock able via a push pin icon and or de docked and removed when the pin is removed. In a multi display gaming machine the player or the operator may freely choose on which panel to display the various graphics objects or alternatively may choose to combine the panels to make a larger virtual display. Interactive controls suggested at in may be offered to the player to change the skin and or location size and any other attribute of the gadgets and the new skin parameters may be provided to the space controller . Such interactive controls may take the form of buttons joysticks trackball touch sensitive display for example as those of skill in this art may appreciate. Accordingly the space controller may coordinate the path of each of all the gadgets in order to generate a seamless game session.

The space controller may receive the outcome targets path and viewing parameters directly from the entertainment graphics objects or alternatively may derive them via a motion capture process . The entertainment graphics objects may receive a start command from the space controller to start viewing the entertainment animation when the bet button is pressed for example.

The outcome engine may receive a bet command from the space controller and obtain the raw random numbers from the random number generator . The outcome engine may receive player credits via Ticket In or any other common payment instrument and cash out via Ticket Out or other payment instrument. An audit engine may securely store a trace of all regulatory data in NVRAM for example. A history process may record all graphic activity and associated outcome data during a game session and forward them at to a history playback process such that the space controller may playback a complete game session when required in order to resolve player disputes.

For illustration shows the concept of projecting a 3D outcome skin onto a simple neutral spherical 3D outcome target according to further aspects of embodiments of the present invention. In a video pool game example balls bearing numbers may be rendered as blind 3D spheres by the freelance entertainment graphics objects . The 3D spheres are 3D outcome targets that are each being passed as shown at in as a 3D model to the space controller together with their associated viewing attributes. In the example of wherein only one pool ball is illustrated the number 12 is being drawn by the outcome engine and is forwarded to the space controller. The outcome gadget having the capability to generate and control animated 3D spheres renders a sphere on which a texture or a skin representing the number 12 drawn by the RNG is dynamically projected as shown at . The player will see a seamless rolling ball bearing number 12.

Similarly in a cosmic voyager game wherein a spacecraft exits light speed travel as it approaches its destination the planet where it would land is revealed. The planets may be rendered as neutral blind 3D spheres by the freelance entertainment graphics objects . The 3D spheres are 3D outcome targets that are each being passed as a 3D model to the space controller together with their associated viewing attributes. In the example of wherein only one planet is illustrated planet earth is being drawn by the outcome engine and is forwarded to the space controller. The outcome gadget having the capability to generate and control animated 3D spheres renders a sphere on which a texture or a skin representing planet earth drawn by the RNG is dynamically projected . The player will see a seamless spinning earth planet. Projected outcome skin or textures may be a single fixed image a number for example or a video image a running horse for example that is warped such as to seamlessly cover the 3D outcome target. Other effects may be applied to the projected outcome skin such as different textures shimmering rippling bump mapping and all manner of modern graphic manipulations as those of skill in this art may appreciate.

Accordingly it is believed desirable to allow casino players to change various aspects of the displayed games to suit their mood preferences and the available video display real estate i.e. single display multi display ultra high resolution display plasma display etc. . . . . Players according to further aspects of embodiments of the present invention may change the style or skin interactively of various game elements and operators may control the parameters centrally or locally via configuration files or centrally federated policies. Player s individually chosen styles may be saved and later recovered and retrieved using without limitation a player card or from a central player account. As discussed below and according to further embodiments of the present invention players may configure their favorite styles and skins on their computers at home and may thereafter retrieve such parameters on the casino floor.

According to an embodiment of the present invention illustrated in the meters may be grouped in a window . The window may be of the pop up or roll out type that is brought into focus at a particular moment during the game action. Traditionally the meters are placed at a fixed location and are always visible. According to an embodiment of the present invention however the player may close the meters window or reduce it to a minimum or smaller size required by regulation by pressing the close or minimize button . The meters window may return to its initial or previous size upon the occurrence of a particular event during the game session such as when a win occurs. The player may move the meters window to another location on the current display panel or to another display panel fitted to the gaming machine by pressing and dragging the move button . The player may resize the meters window by pressing the Size button whereupon a menu may pop up offering various menu sizes. Alternatively each time the button is pressed the meters window may assume a different size. Alternatively again the player may drag one corner of the window for resizing it. The player may change the transparency of the meters window by pressing the Opacity button whereupon a menu may pop up offering various opacity values. Alternatively the meters window may assume a different opacity each time the button is pressed. Similarly other buttons or interaction means may be offered for changing the presentation style or skin of the meters window. The meters windows may be docked i.e. locked anchored or pinned at a particular location and be prevented from being closed or minimized by pressing the pin button . Other interaction means may be provided to afford both players and operators great latitude in customizing the appearance of the game. For example it may be desirable to apply the same window control concepts to other types of windows and gadgets available to the player during a game session consequently all graphics objects may be given the same capabilities without limitation of moving docking resizing opacity minimizing and skin style change.

It is to be noted that one or more of the interaction means and elements of may form part of a management console of a central computer system in . Such a management console may be configured to enable policies to be interactively set by a game operator regulatory official an employee of a gaming facility in which the gaming machine is located by another person or programmatically for controlling the layout of one or more of the plurality of graphic objects on the display s of the gaming machine. Such interactively set policies may be enforced by the central system to one or more gaming machines coupled thereto. Such a management console may be operative to control the layout appearance and optionally other attributes of one or more of the graphic objects displayed on the display s of selected ones or all of the gaming machines that are connected to the remote central computer system .

Each group of graphic objects may be controlled by a separate controlling process executing in a process sandbox. As an immediate benefit the software controlling each group of graphic objects may be controlled by a partitioned software having a well defined application programming interface API developed by an independent software group or software vendor. The end to end security principles described in the commonly assigned and co pending patent application Ser. No. 10 520 831 filed Jan. 5 2005 entitled Secure Game Download and commonly assigned and co pending patent application Ser. No. 10 789 975 filed Feb. 27 2004 entitled Dynamic Configuration of a Gaming System may be fully applied. Both of the aforementioned patent applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In addition the modular principles described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6 916 247 entitled Modular Entertainment And Gaming Systems commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6 908 391 entitled Modular Entertainment And Gaming System Configured To Boot Its Operating System And Or Application Software From A Remote Device commonly assigned and co pending application Ser.

No. 6 916 244 entitled Server Less Cashless Gaming Systems And Methods all applications and patents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties may also be applied to great advantage. This modular approach may encourage freelance software developers to specialize in some sophisticated and engaging game add ons or plug ins and offer them to gaming machine vendors to add to their game software. For example a player tracking module developed by company X may comprise a central control module located in a central server such as shown at in on the gaming network that directly and securely controls a graphics gadget on each gaming machine via .NET Remoting RPC or other IP service. Likewise company Y may specialize in offering skin able meters plug ins that provides a wide range of presentation themes and dazzling 3D animations and sounds. The game designer may decide at game design time on a suitable meters presentation or alternatively the player and the game operator may be given the option to select a presentation or skin without requiring the game software to undergo a lab test and recertification.

Alternatively and as shown in the group of spinning wheels may occupy the overall space across the video display and the meters are rendered with a predetermined transparency over the wheels. Indeed the transparency may vary from full transparency to fully opaque. Moreover the size thereof may vary from large to small under software control at different moments within the gaming session.

Later generation graphic platform such as Microsoft Windows Platform Foundation WPF WinFX .NET Framework 3.0 and XNA Game Studio Express for Windows Vista and Windows XP together with associated new generation of graphic design tools such as Microsoft Expression suite in which graphics are no longer bound by raster technology but are fully scalable using vector graphics may allow creative minds to develop dazzling graphics. Microsoft s Visual Studio Express is aiming to democratize application development by putting development tools into the hands of novice and hobbyist programmers. Microsoft officials hope XNA Game Studio Express will democratize game development by delivering the necessary tools to hobbyists students independent developers and studios to help them more readily create games for the Xbox 360. This democratization will enable game players to more easily become game developers company officials said. And by joining a creators club for an annual subscription fee of 99 developers will be able to build test and share their games on Xbox 360 and access other materials to help them develop games for the Microsoft platform Microsoft said. Code signing each module with an individual certificate would enable end to end security throughout the life cycle of the game and ensure that freelance developers are rewarded in accordance with the success of their games or plug ins. This may be accomplished by examining the audit logs containing a trace of the certificate ID for each module executed. Individual modules of the games and not the entire game may be replaced via central download to speed up and reduce cost of ownership.

According to an embodiment of the present invention players of the unregulated downloaded trial games may opt to provide information such as a list of the players favorite games for example to the Gaming Exchange Portal to enable casino operators and or select others to offer incentives to attract them to their casino. Alternatively consent to providing such information may be a pre condition to downloading and or playing the trial unregulated games .

Freelance game developers may enrich the gaming exchange portal by adapting popular gaming titles played on PCs or game consoles such as GameCube PlayStation and XBOX for play on the floor of the casino or by using their experience and expertise to create new unregulated games specifically for the casinos. In this manner freelance game developers drive the exchange portal by adapting popular gaming titles for play on the casino floor or by using their experience and expertise to create new games specifically for the casino all games are preferably configured with a standard API . The existing games adapted with permission by the freelance developers may originate from the game library of popular console type gaming platforms such as Microsoft s XBOX or XBOX 360 Sony s Playstation or Nintendo s GameCube for example as shown at or any future gaming system. Games specifically developed for e.g. the PC or Apple platforms may also be adapted as described above. Alternatively wholly new games may be developed by the freelance developers. Alternatively still the makers or licensees of such gaming consoles may adapt existing games within their games library in house in the manner described herein. Once such new or adapted modified games are created the freelance or in house game developers may submit a copy of the new or adapted game along two paths namely an unregulated path and in cooperation with a licensed game developer e.g. Cyberscan WMS Bally etc. a regulated path .

Such unregulated first versions of games developed by the freelance game developers or others are preferably such that they do not make use of Internet communication and Internet display technologies to execute and play on the home computing device . That is the unregulated first versions of the games in contradistinction to the regulated and certified second versions of the same games preferably do not use Internet communication technologies such as for example and without limitation HTTP Requests HTTP Replies cookies and or Secure Socket Layers SSL to play or execute on the player s home computing device whether before or after the player has downloaded a copy thereof . Similarly the unregulated first versions of the games in contradistinction to the regulated and certified second versions of the same games preferably do not use Internet display technologies such as for example and also without limitation the use of Internet browsers HTML Java Scrips Java applets Scriptlets ActiveX controls plug ins pop ups and or cookies to ply or operate the games.

In particular the first outcome free portion of the unregulated first version of the game is preferably configured to not make use of Internet communication and or Internet display technologies to execute and play on the home computing device. Similarly the graphics portions of the unregulated first version of the game is preferably configured to also not make use of Internet communication and or Internet display technologies to execute and play on the home computing device.

Downloading but not execution and playing of the unregulated first versions of games developed by the freelance may however make use of Internet communication technologies and Internet display technologies.

Returning now to once new games are adapted and or created game developers may submit e.g. upload a copy of each developed game to the gaming exchange portal along two paths an unregulated path and a regulated path in cooperation with a licensed game developer e.g. Cyberscan WMS Bally etc. via the appropriate gaming certification laboratory as required in the appropriate jurisdiction. The freelance game developer may upload separate versions of the developed game for each of a plurality of targeted types of home computing devices. Such computing devices may include for example personal computers which may include for example both Windows based devices and those running a version of an operating system from Apple Computers game consoles e.g. XBOX360 portable computers and portable telephones.

According to an embodiment of the present invention the regulated version of the game submitted along path comprises the merging of the outcome free game software of the freelance game developer and the outcome bearing game software of the licensed game developer that is then submitted to an independent certification lab to ensure that it meets all gaming and security standards. Once certification is granted the now certified game may be loaded into a regulated games repository of a selectively accessible predetermined computer site such as a Web site for example . Gaming machines located on the floor of the casino may then access the certified and regulated games loaded in the regulated games repository and such games offered to the casino players . As may be required by regulation the regulated games of the regulated games repository may be first downloaded to the central system before being made available to the gaming machines to allow for a centrally federated enforcement of policies. Alternatively such certified and regulated games may be made available over a computer network to other computing devices located in other venues such as hotel rooms or cruise ship staterooms for example subject to appropriate security measures and regulatory approval. Suitable means for providing regulated gaming to guest rooms in the hospitality industry are described in commonly assigned and co pending patent application Ser. No. 11 456 763 filed Jul. 11 2006 entitled In Room Gaming which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

As shown in the unregulated version of the game may be loaded as a shadow copy in a shadow repository of the regulated games repository from which players at home may download it as shown at for trial play on their home computers using an internet connection. Such games may be similar or substantially identical to the games submitted for certification but for the aspects thereof concerned with money including the source of randomization used to determine the outcome of the game which may be different in the regulated version of the game than it is in the unregulated version thereof . For example the two versions of the game may look and play exactly or nearly exactly the same. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the source code of the freelance code for the regulated version of the software and for the unregulated version of the software are substantially identical at least for the code related to providing the dazzling entertaining scenes. For example if both the gaming machine and the home computer use the PC architecture running under Microsoft Windows then the source code for both versions of the freelance software for the regulated game software and for the unregulated game software may be substantially identical using the same for example C code. Alternatively if the gaming machine uses the PC architecture running under Microsoft Windows and the home computer uses the XBOX 360 then the source code of the freelance software for both versions for the regulated game software and for the unregulated game software may be substantially identical using Visual Studio and XNA Game Studio Express. Alternatively again if the gaming machine outcome free entertaining software executes on the XBOX 360 and the home computer uses the PC architecture runs under Microsoft Windows then the source code of the freelance software for both versions for the regulated game software and for the unregulated game software may be substantially identical using for example Visual Studio and XNA Game Studio Express. In contrast some conventional gaming systems make gaming software available for download by players on their home PC. However such gaming software that is available for download is for evaluation only and does not use the same source code for the non regulated version of the gaming software as for the regulated version thereof. For example the non regulated version of such conventional downloaded evaluation gaming software may execute in a web browser while the regulated version of conventional gaming software may execute in a proprietary graphic shell.

In direct contrast a player of an unregulated game according to embodiments of the present invention downloaded from the exchange onto his or her home computer or home computing device which may include a branded gaming console will have much the same gaming experience when he or she plays at home as when he or she plays the regulated and certified version of the same game on a regulated gaming machine in a casino or other gaming establishment but for the wagering aspects of the game which on the regulated gaming machine include playing for real money or other tangible value . Usage metrics from this process may be used to structure game offering menus on the casino floor such that the most popular gaming titles are front loaded.

On the floor of the casino each gaming machine records its regulatory meters from which usage metrics of gaming titles may be derived. An embodiment of the invention may rely on code signing of game code according to the principles set out in the commonly assigned and co pending patent application Ser. No. 10 520 831 filed Aug. 12 2005 entitled Secure Game Download which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A trusted audit trail may also be splashed in the event log. Embodiments of the present invention may allocate an individual PKI certificate to each executable software component of the certified and regulated games and to each of their versions binding the PKI certificate to the executable software and associating a distinctive policy for each PKI certificate. The PKI certificate s Subject Name or Issued to field or CommonName field may be a concatenation of the software component identification its version number and optionally other identification characters for example. In this manner the subject name may also comprise an embedded secure license identifier of the developer for license tracking. Therefore examination of the game audits reveals the detailed metrics of each played game and statistics may be generated in order to reward the freelance game developers with financial compensation as shown at in accordance with the popularity of their games. Thanks to End to End Download Security and Embedded Secure License Identifiers developers will receive financial compensation in accordance with game success.

A new game submitted along path may include outcome free code and outcome bearing code. The outcome free code may be developed by the freelance game developers and the outcome bearing code may be developed by the supplier game developers as detailed above. It is to be understood that variations are possible as those of skill in this art may appreciate. For example embodiments of the present invention provide for both the outcome free code and the outcome bearing code being developed by the same entity be it the freelance code developers or the supplier game developers. In order to be permitted to enter the regulatory certification cycles the supplier game developers may take delivery of the outcome free code developed by the freelance game developers and may submit the entire code that makes up the new game submitted along path i.e. the outcome free code and the outcome bearing code to the certification lab . The outcome free code may include code that need not be submitted to the certification lab in source code form. The outcome bearing code and the outcome free code if needed may be submitted to the certification lab in any manner or may be submitted as disclosed in commonly assigned and co pending patent application Ser. No. 11 251 628 filed Oct. 14 2005 entitled Universal Method For Submitting Gaming Machine Source Code Software To A Game Certification Laboratory which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Although less secure than the compartmented freelance code described earlier in this specification another embodiment of the present invention may include submitting to the certification lab an outcome determining free game software that includes only graphic rendering code such as macromedia .swf files for example. Although .swf files do render outcome graphically i.e. may render a winning number on the video display in response to a provided outcome code via a Macromedia flash players installed in the gaming machines and in the home computer devices they do not determine the outcome. The outcome determining game software is a separate code that is developed by the licensed game developer and that is submitted to the gaming software certification laboratory in source code form. The .swf files are derived from the Macromedia Director Studio a graphic animation studio are not produced directly by a human programmer and are not directly executable can only be rendered via a Flash player noting that the Flash player does not necessary require an Internet web browser to render graphic animations . Consequently the gaming software certification laboratory may not examine any outcome determining free source code. A freelance developer may provide .swf outcome determining free files or equivalent from a different graphic animation studio for the purpose of the regulated gaming exchange invention described herein. The outcome determining free approach is notably adopted by Cyberscan in UK and early deployments in USA for their regulated gaming machines.

The regulated new game certified by the lab may be transferred to the gaming exchange portal in a regulated games repository that contains a plurality of regulated games available for download to authorized parties. A copy of a regulated game may be downloaded from the regulated games repository by an operator of the casino for deployment in the gaming machines of the casino after determining from the usage and popularity metrics for example that this game is likely a good fit in his casino for a predetermined profile of players. In turn the operator of the casino may send promotional information such as casino locations carrying the new game and vouchers to the gaming exchange portal to enable the promotional information to be forwarded to the appropriate players via email or other channels in accordance for example with the usage metrics obtained from the registered players and their contacts details and preferences as such players have previously played the unregulated trial version of the game on their home computers for example.

The gaming exchange portal may be configured to deploy policies such as active directory policies or equivalent ADM policy scripts to the player s home computer such as to enforce software installation policies SIP and software restriction policies SRP in accordance with the principles detailed in commonly assigned and co pending patent application Ser. No. 10 789 975 filed Feb. 27 2004 entitled Dynamic Configuration Of A Gaming System which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in order to offer the player some confidence that the origin of the software is from a reputable source to ensure proper updating of new game software components and to revoke obsolete game software components. Policies may be used to ensure the proper localization variant of the game is executed by the player in accordance with local regulation. Indeed the player may choose the localization variant of the applicable state where he wishes to try the game or play for real money or other value at his or her preferred casino.

A player playing his or her favorite game on his home computer may select various presentation preferences such as those described above for Virtual Display and store his or her preferences in a player profile on a local storage or on the gaming exchange portal . When the player travels to a casino the player may play his favorite game on a gaming machine and may also retrieve his or her preferences from the stored player profile. In this manner the game played on the gaming machine within the casino or other location appears as it did on his or her home computer that is with his or her preferences incorporated in the displayed graphics of the game and or game play.

Advertising sensing technology may be implemented such as Google AdSense as a fast and easy way for game operators and freelance developers to display relevant ads on their result content pages to offer home players an opportunity to follow links to examine casino promotions and freelance full size unregulated version of the games . The history of the queries of each player combined with their usage metrics may be analyzed to derive intelligence therefrom relative to their preferences such that the ads and associated links may be tailored according to what the visiting players are looking for.

The database and search engine may also contain the player profiles and queries may be formulated to derive intelligence on the most popular player profiles.

The players at home may formulate a search query by entering selected game attributes via a search page which is forwarded to the database and search engine . The search engine may then return a search response to the player. Freelance developers may also formulate a search query by entering selected game attributes via a search page which is forwarded to the database and search engine . The search engine would then returns a search response . Similarly the game operator may formulate search queries and get search responses. A player on the casino floor may formulate search queries and obtain search responses whenever the casino operator provides facilities to access the game exchange portal search engine . Access may be provided to the players directly via the gaming machine or via auxiliary consoles disposed on the casino floor.

The gaming operator may for security reasons provide an internal database and search engine connected to the central management system that provides the same functions as the external database and search engine and allow the players to formulate queries related to games and promotions.

While the foregoing detailed description has described preferred embodiments of the present invention it is to be understood that the above description is illustrative only and not limiting of the disclosed invention. Those of skill in this art will recognize other alternative embodiments and all such embodiments are deemed to fall within the scope of the present invention. Thus the present invention should be limited only by the claims as set forth below.
