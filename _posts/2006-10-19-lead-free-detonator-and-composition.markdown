title: Lead free detonator and composition
abstract: A lead-free primer energetic composition including Cyanuric Triazide (60%), Tetracene (5%), Barium Nitrate (20%) and Antimony Trisulfide (15%) is produced. The lead-free primer energetic composition is used to construct a primary detonator including a transfer charge of Cyanuric Triazide, which produces a further initiation train that may subsequently detonate a secondary explosive, i.e., HDX, RDX, or a pyrotechnic device.

The application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 596 762 filed 19 Oct. 2005 the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference as if set forth at length herein.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention described herein may be made used or licensed by or for the United States Government for government purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

This invention relates generally to the field of energetic materials including explosives and propellants. More particularly it pertains to a lead free composition and detonator constructed therefrom for detonating energetic materials.

Primary detonators a.k.a. primers are widely employed in a variety of application areas to initiate the explosion of a more powerful secondary explosive such as may be found for example in ammunitions artillery shells high explosives or fireworks. Common primers produce this explosive initiation through the effect of an energetic material or energetic mixtures that are responsive to a mechanical or other stimulus. When placed adjacent to or within a secondary explosive energy produced by detonation of the primer causes the secondary explosive to detonate.

Common primer energetic materials all contain lead i.e. lead azide lead styphnate etc. For example NOL 130 a commonly used energetic mixture used in primers contains lead styphnate and lead azide along with barium nitrate antimony sulfide and tetracene.

While such energetic materials effectively initiate the detonation of secondary explosives the use and manufacture of lead based materials pose acute and chronic toxicity hazards during their preparation production and beyond including later in the life cycle of an item containing such lead based materials after that item has been field functioned.

In accordance with a first aspect of the instant invention a lead free primer energetic composition including Cyanuric Triazide 60 Tetracene 5 Barium Nitrate 20 and Antimony Trisulfide 15 is produced.

In accordance with another aspect of the instant invention the lead free primer energetic composition is used to construct a primary detonator including a transfer charge of Cyanuric Triazide which produces a further initiation train that may subsequently detonate a secondary explosive i.e. HDX RDX or a pyrotechnic device.

The following merely illustrates the principles of the invention. It will thus be appreciated that those skilled in the art will be able to devise various arrangements which although not explicitly described or shown herein embody the principles of the invention and are included within its spirit and scope.

Furthermore all examples and conditional language recited herein are principally intended expressly to be only for pedagogical purposes to aid the reader in understanding the principles of the invention and the concepts contributed by the inventor s to furthering the art and are to be construed as being without limitation to such specifically recited examples and conditions.

Moreover all statements herein reciting principles aspects and embodiments of the invention as well as specific examples thereof are intended to encompass both structural and functional equivalents thereof. Additionally it is intended that such equivalents include both currently known equivalents as well as equivalents developed in the future i.e. any elements developed that perform the same function regardless of structure.

Thus for example it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the diagrams herein represent conceptual views of illustrative structures embodying the principles of the invention.

Turning now to shown therein is a stab detonator assembly generally comprising a firing pin a primer charge and a transfer charge . The primer charge is an energetic composition or mixture that is sensitive to mechanical stimulus. Similarly the transfer charge is sensitive to a stimulus produced when the primer charge detonates.

Operationally and with reference now to the firing pin is driven by a gas or mechanical actuation mechanism . When so driven the firing pin is forced through a detonator case and into the primer charge .

Rapid heating caused by the resulting compression and friction of the firing pin driven into the primer charge results in its initiation. The resulting rapid decomposition of the primer charge generates a pressure temperature pulse that is sufficient to stimulate the detonation of the transfer charge .

The detonation of the transfer charge produces sufficient output energy to detonate a secondary main explosive such as a high explosive propellant or pyrotechnic . In a conventional stab detonator the transfer charge comprises Lead Azide which as already noted is particularly hazardous and therefore undesirable.

According to one aspect of the invention a lead free primer charge is employed in the detonator assembly. This lead free primer charge composition comprises Cyanuric Triazide 60 by weight Tetracene a.k.a. 4 guanyl 1 alpha tetrazol 5yl tetrazene or guanyldiazoguanyl tetrazene 5 by weight Barium Nitrate Ba NO 20 by weight and Antimony Trisulfide SbSor SbS 15 by weight . Advantageously Cyanuric Triazide 2 4 6 triazido 1 3 5 triazine is a known energetic material exhibiting high impact and friction sensitivity. As can be observed from its chemical formula it contains only carbon and nitrogen atoms. Additionally Tetracene a.k.a. 4 guanyl 1 alpha tetrazol 5yl tetrazene or guanyldiazoguanyl tetrazene is also a lead free compound.

Of particular importance Cyanuric Triazide is thermally stable exhibiting a decomposition of 187 C. and may be readily prepared by any of a number of known methods. Preparation of the lead free primer charge according to the present invention requires the combination of the Cyanuric Triazide with the remaining compounds listed above substantially in the amounts described. Advantageously as the components are all substantially dry powders the preparation may be conducted by placing the components in a drum tumbler and mixing for a suitable period of time i.e. 30 minutes.

Those skilled in the art will recognize a number of the compounds employed in the present invention and in particular Cyanuric Triazide which has been characterized extensively. See. e.g Tomlinson W. R. Jr. Sheffield O. E. Properties of Explosives of Military Interest TR 1740 Picatinny Arsenal Dover N. J. April 1958. pp. 72 75 Fedoroff B. T. Sheffield. O. E.

Some exemplary preparations of the Cyanuric Triazide and the lead free primer charge are provided as follows.

Cyanuric triazide 2 grams was dissolved in acetone 20 mL at ambient temperature. The solution was poured in a steady stream into water 200 mL stirred at a temperature of 3 5 C. The precipitated solids were suction filtered and dried at 38 45 C.

Cyanuric triazide 2 grams was dissolved in acetone 20 mL at ambient temperature. The solution was added to a disposable syringe with disposable needle attached. The solution was injected over a 30 60 second period from a height of 2 6 inches into water 200 mL stirred at a temperature of 3 5 C. The precipitated solids were suction filtered and dried at 38 45 C.

The solution was injected over a 30 60 second period from a height of 2 6 inches into water 200 mL stirred at a temperature of 3 5 C. A solution of ethyl cellulose 0.04 grams in acetone 10 mL. was added to a disposable syringe with disposable needle attached. The solution was injected over a 15 30 second period from a height of 2 6 inches into the water slurry. The precipitated solids were suction filtered and dried at 38 45 C.

The solution was injected over a 30 60 second period from a height of 2 6 inches into water 200 mL stirred at a temperature of 3 5 C. The precipitated solids were suction filtered and dried at 38 45 C.
