title: Boot architecture discovery in pre-boot environment
abstract: Identifying characteristics of a client in a pre-boot environment. A packet is received from the client. The packet includes a request for an image to boot the client by a computing device. An application is transmitted from the computing device to the client in response to the received packet. The client executes the transmitted application. A response is received from the application executed by the client. The characteristics of the client are determined based on the received response. An image to boot the client is transmitted, and the transmitted image is a function of the determined characteristics.

When deploying an operating system to multiple computing devices it is beneficial to utilize tools to automate the deployment process. For example in a computing device manufacturing process an original equipment manufacturer OEM typically installs an operating system OS with standard configurations or a standard OS to the computing device before customers purchase them at retail stores or over the Internet. In a corporate setting a business may need to upgrade a number of identically configured machines simultaneously and efficiently using such automated process.

Typically the standard OS is deployed and installed automatically to the computing devices by copying or duplicating a predetermined OS image to the computing device for booting the computing device. For example the automated deployment and installation process would install the OS with standard configurations on a memory storage area of each of the computing devices via a wired or a wireless connection. Upgrades to OS or other applications may be installed in a similar fashion.

However with the ongoing advancements and developments in storage medium and computing device processing powers installing a standard set of OS image to a number of computing devices no longer accounts for proper configuration of the computing devices.

One available system Pre Boot Execution Environment PXE protocol allows a client to obtain an OS image from a PXE server in a networked environment. The client initiates the PXE process by broadcasting a PXE request in the networked environment. However any PXE server listening for a request can read and choose to respond to the client. A disadvantage results if more than one PXE server exists in the networked environment because the client will be serviced by whichever PXE server responds the quickest to the client s request. For example if two PXE servers are in the networked environment the first configured with application logic to service personal computer clients and a second configured to service any type of device e.g. personal computers point of sale devices and network servers it is not possible to determine which PXE server will be the first to respond to the request from a point of sale device client. Therefore it is possible that while using the PXE protocol the point of sale device may incorrectly receive a boot image for a personal computer.

In addition not only does an entity needs to deploy an OS on a number of different classes of computing devices from personal digital assistant PDA to server computers to point of sale terminals the entity also needs to consider that each class of the computing devices may require particular configurations due to hardware components. For example a PDA X with a chip having a processing power of 500 MHz and a storage memory capacity of 5 GB may require a different OS image from another PDA Y in the same production line with a chip having a processing power of 733 MHz and a storage memory capacity of 10 GB. As such the existing OS image deployment systems of installing an OS with standard configuration or a standard OS image would not properly configure the PDA Y because both PDA X and PDA Y would receive the same OS image for booting the devices. In addition current OS image deployment systems lack the ability to properly detect differences in hardware components in the computing devices to efficiently deploy and install appropriate OS images to the computing devices.

Embodiments of the invention overcome the shortfalls of the existing OS deployment systems by first detecting the computing architecture of the client before sending an appropriate boot OS image file to boot the client. In particular embodiments of the invention deploy or transmit an application to the client in response to a request to boot the client with an OS image.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Referring to the system illustrates an exemplary embodiment in which aspects of the invention may be implemented. A server which may be one of a plurality of servers includes components that enable the deployment of an operating system OS to a plurality of clients via a networked environment . In one embodiment the server deploys the OS such as MAC OS X UNIX Linux or Windows Vista operating system to the clients . The server and the clients may communicate via a number of underlying network transport mechanisms available in the networked environment . In one embodiment the transport mechanisms include Transmission Control Protocol TCP Trivial File Transfer Protocol TFTP User Datagram Protocol UDP Remote Procedure Call RPC File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP or the like. In one example server in system includes a server described in .

The clients include one or more computing devices such as a desktop computer a laptop computer a personal digital assistant PDA or other devices. In another embodiment server and each of the clients implement at least a part of a computer depicted in .

In one example system may be used in a pre boot execution environment PXE . For example server may be a PXE server which watches for dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP discovery requests that include a special tag identifying the client as a PXE client. If the discovery request includes the tag the PXE server replies to the client with configuration information including the name of a boot image file which may include an OS boot image pre OS image file pre boot agents e.g. computer executable instructions for scanning clients for viruses before installing an OS . The boot image file may transferred to clients using TFTP and the transferred file may be used to boot the clients .

Referring now to an exemplary embodiment of the server of the invention is shown. The server includes one or more components such as a transport layer a PXE server and a Control Protocol Server . The transport layer handles the details associated with communicating with clients and provides a transport independent communication mechanism to the PXE Server and the Control Protocol Server . In one embodiment the transport layer may communicate with the clients utilizing a variety of network protocols including Transmission Control Protocol TCP User Datagram Protocol UDP Remote Procedure Call RPC and HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP .

The PXE server accepts PXE requests from the clients . PXE is one of the components of the Wired for Management WfM specification that allows the clients to boot from the PXE server on a network prior to booting an operating system from a hard drive local to the clients . After receiving the PXE request from the client the PXE server passes the request to a PXE provider . The PXE provider is a component containing the application logic to formulate a response to the clients . In one embodiment the PXE provider is Boot Information Negotiation Layer A BINL . The responsibilities of the BINL service include answering the request querying a directory service on behalf of the clients as well ensuring that the correct policy and configuration settings are applied to the clients during the operating system installation. In another embodiment the PXE provider includes two or more PXE providers each with distinct application logic.

The Control Protocol Server accepts requests from a reduced operating system environment. The reduced operating system aids in the deployment of the operating system. In one embodiment the Control Protocol Server accepts Microsoft Windows Preinstallation Environment WinPE requests. After receiving the request from the clients the Control Protocol Server passes the request to a Control Protocol Provider . The Control Protocol Provider is a component containing the application logic to formulate a response to the clients . In one embodiment the Control Protocol Provider includes a plurality of providers such as A and B.

It is also to be understood that additional components connected wired or wirelessly to the server may be added to perform operations of the transport layer the PXE server and the control protocol server .

Initially a client e.g. client attempts to request to be booted by a server e.g. PXE server . The request is received by the server which may be coupled with one or more other servers e.g. a Windows Deployment Services WDS server or PXE providers for responding to the request.

In existing OS boot image file deployment systems the server responds to the request by sending a standard or a predetermined OS boot image file to the client. For example suppose the clients sending the requests include computing devices with 32 bit architecture and computing devices with 64 bit architecture. Current deployment systems would regardless of the different computing architecture configurations respond the request by sending a generic or standard OS boot image file. As such all clients either with 32 bit or 64 bit architecture will receive the same boot image file e.g. 32 bit boot image file . As such under current deployment systems the computing devices with 64 bit architecture need to perform additional evaluation and detection before sending another request to the server for a more appropriate OS boot image file the 64 bit OS image before the computing devices can boot accordingly.

Upon receiving the boot application a processor of client executes the boot application by accessing a memory storing boot application . In one embodiment the boot application is a 16 bit real mode network boot program that determines or identifies the computing architecture of client . It is to be understood that other types of boot programs e.g. protected mode boot program may be used in determining or identifying the computing architecture of client .

In one embodiment boot application after execution by the processor performs a test for identifying whether client is 64 bit compatible. In this embodiment the test includes setting a value for a particular control option in registers of processor and identifying another value as a response to be returned to server . In this example the value returned by processor indicates whether client supports 64 bit computer executable instructions. In another embodiment the response includes at least the information of processor of client .

In response to the returned value boot application sends the response to processor of server . In one example the response includes a value included in a DHCP option field. In one embodiment the value for the DHCP option field corresponds to the characteristics of the client. In another example response configures a value for a DHCP option field in server . The processor of server may further evaluate the value in the DHCP option field to determine the information of the computing architecture of client .

Based on the received response processor of server identifies the computing architecture of client and transmits the boot image file to the client . The processor of client next executes the boot image file to boot the client .

As such embodiments of invention enable users or administrators of server based on response from boot application to select an appropriate boot image file to boot client before an OS or a pre OS is installed in client . By avoiding sending unnecessary or incompatible boot image files to client aspects of the invention efficiently configure and boot client using boot application .

Referring now to a block diagram illustrates an exemplary computer readable medium on which aspects of the invention may be stored. For example components illustrated in execute one or more computer executable instructions described in the flow chart of for identifying characteristics of a client in a pre boot environment according to an embodiment of the invention.

For example a communications component receives a packet from the client e.g. client at . The packet includes a request for an image to boot the client by a server e.g. server . At the communications component transmits a booting engine as a boot application from the server to the client in response to the received request. The boot engine generates a response relating to the information associated with the computing architecture of the client for the server. At the generated response is provided to the communications component and the server received the response from the communications component . At the server processes the response and determines or identifies the computing architecture of the client based on the received response from the booting engine. A memory component stores a plurality of images for booting the client. A service component being responsive to the information associated with the determined architecture selects at least one of the plurality of images to be transmitted by the communications component to the client for booting the client. In one embodiment the service component based on the received response configures a value for a DHCP option field in the server. In another embodiment service component evaluates the value in the DHCP option field for determining the information of the computing architecture of the client.
