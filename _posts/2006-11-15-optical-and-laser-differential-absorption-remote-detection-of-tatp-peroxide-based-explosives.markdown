title: Optical and laser differential absorption remote detection of TATP peroxide based explosives
abstract: A triacetone triperoxide cloud associated with a triacetone triperoxide explosive attached to a hard target is remotely detected by operating differential-absorption lidar lasers to transmit a laser beam toward the hard target at differing wavelengths. A backscattered laser beam reflected from the lidar target (hard target, person, aerosols, clouds, buildings) is detected because a cloud of triacetone triperoxide in front of the lidar target and between the lidar target and the differential-absorption lidar system produces a differential-absorption signal having characteristics that identify the triacetone triperoxide. In a second embodiment, a triacetone triperoxide cloud that is absorbing optical radiation from its ambient environment and which is attached to a hard target is detected from a location remote from the triacetone triperoxide explosive by detecting an optical radiation absorption signature characterized by triacetone triperoxide absorption lines.

This application claims priority to currently pending U.S. provisional patent application No. 60 597 179 by the same inventors entitled Laser Remote Detection of TATP Explosives filed Nov. 15 2005.

This invention was made with U.S. government support under Grant No. N66001 05 C 8017 2005 awarded by DARPA SPAWAR under a contract from Newtek Corporation to the University of Central Florida to Dennis Killinger Consultant University of South Florida and by a DARPA grant to the University of South Florida through US AFOSR FA9550 06 1 0363. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to laser remote sensing. More particularly it relates to the remote detection and measurement of selected gases in the atmosphere or of trace gases emitted into the atmosphere.

The most common technique employed for laser remote sensing involves differential absorption lidar DIAL . DIAL transmits two or more different wavelengths toward a distant target and detects backscattered light using a telescope and optical detector. The technique of DIAL for the detection of trace gas clouds in the atmosphere has been known for many years.

Successful detection of a trace gas cloud requires that the gas being detected has a strong optical absorption of one of the DIAL laser wavelengths and that lasers exit at the trace gas absorption wavelengths to permit DIAL or lidar detection of the backscattered optical signal. Previous attempts to detect gas clouds emitted by common nitrogen based munitions explosives such as TNT and RDX have not been successful because the vapor pressure of TNT and RDX is extremely low. Attempts to use a DIAL remote sensing system were not successful because the optical depth i.e. gas concentration times the optical attenuation coefficient of the gas was negligible or very small. The remote detection of triacetone triperoxide TATP explosives had not yet been conducted successfully. It was not previously known that TATP had a high vapor pressure and strong optical absorption spectra that could be thus used for remote optical or DIAL detection of a TATP gas cloud.

Thus there is a need to incorporate DIAL technology into a system for remotely detecting the presence of TATP.

However in view of the art considered as a whole at the time the present invention was made it was not obvious to those of ordinary skill in this art how the identified needs could be met.

The long standing but heretofore unfulfilled need for a method for detecting a TATP explosive from a safe remote distance is now provided by a new useful and nonobvious invention.

The novel method for detecting a TATP cloud associated with a triacetone triperoxide explosive attached to a hard target such as a person from a location remote from said TATP explosive includes the steps of operating a differential absorption lidar system including differential absorption lidar lasers to transmit a laser beam toward the hard target at differing wavelengths. A backscattered laser beam reflected from the hard target is then detected. The detection is possible because a cloud of triacetone triperoxide in front of the hard target and between the hard target and the differential absorption lidar system produces a differential absorption signal having characteristics that identify the triacetone triperoxide.

More particularly the novel method includes the step of operating a line tunable COlaser near 10.2 to 10.6 micron wavelength. The novel method also includes the step of operating a tunable quantum cascade laser near 8.2 micron wavelength or the step of operating a quantum cascade laser near 3.3 micron wavelength. Alternatively the novel method can be performed by operating an optical parametric oscillator laser near 3.3 micron wavelength.

In a second embodiment of the novel method a triacetone triperoxide cloud that is absorbing optical radiation from its ambient environment and which is attached to a hard target is detected from a location remote from the triacetone triperoxide explosive by detecting an optical radiation absorption signature characterized by triacetone triperoxide absorption lines or absorption bands.

Such detection may be performed by a spectroscopic instrument capable of detecting said absorption of optical radiation. A passive spectrometer or an imaging hyperspectral Fourier Transform Infrared FT IR instrument may also be used. An optical filtered spectroscopic imaging means that can detect the strong absorption features of triacetone triperoxide may also be employed.

A particular type of explosive triacetone triperoxide TATP a peroxide based explosive has a vapor pressure that is fifteen thousand 15 000 times greater than that of TNT as graphically depicted in and has large optical absorption spectral features as graphically depicted in . More particularly the vapor pressure of TATP is seven pascals 7 Pa 0.05 torr or 65 ppm.

Measurements conducted using actual samples of TATP indicates that the surrounding vapor cloud of TATP has a diameter of about one meter 1 m . A TATP based explosive can be made easily and is unique in that it out gases readily.

The vapor cloud surrounding a solid sample of TATP could potentially produce an optical absorption of a transmitted optical beam of nearly 20 to 30 with the following values 

For a one meter 1 m diameter cloud of TATP twenty 20 times the length of a five centimeter 5 cm cell 2 ways 

Such a large absorption signal is easily detected by a DIAL system or an optical spectroscopic detection instrument or a spectrometer imaging instrument such as the US Army M 21 FT IR spectral detection passive spectroscopic system.

Lasers operating near the spectral absorption bands of TATP are available and such lasers are hereby identified for use in a laser remote sensing system for TATP detection. The lasers that may be used include a line tunable COlaser operating near 10.2 to 10.6 micron wavelength a tunable quantum cascade laser operating near 8.2 micron wavelength and a quantum cascade laser or optical parametric oscillator OPO laser operating near 3.3 micron wavelength or frequency mixed or generated laser radiation at any of the three or more large absorption lines of TATP including those near 10.6 microns 8.2 microns and 3.3 microns. All three 3 of these lasers have been used in DIAL systems for remote detection of trace species in the atmosphere before but have never been used for remote detection of TATP.

The preferred method of detection is where the TATP sample is contained within a package or person and the TATP is out gassing sufficiently to produce a cloud of TATP 65 ppm concentration in front of the container or person. The DIAL system transmits an eye safe laser beam toward the person and detects the backscattered laser beam reflected from the hard target person . The cloud of TATP in front of the person and between the hard target and the DIAL system produces the differential absorption signal as the DIAL lasers are tuned or operated at the different DIAL wavelengths. The DIAL or Lidar target producing the backscattered DIAL or Lidar returns can also include aerosols clouds vapors or hard targets such as buildings person car bodies and trees.

In a second embodiment the TATP cloud absorbs ambient light from the sun moon environment thermal radiation or the like and produces an absorption signature due to the TATP absorption lines. This absorption of optical radiation can be detected by different types of spectroscopic instruments including a passive spectrometer an imaging hyperspectral FT IR instrument or optical filtered spectroscopic imaging CCD camera or detector that can detect the strong optical absorption features of TATP.

The vapor pressure of TATP was found to be 15 000 times higher than most other explosives. The measured vapor pressure of TATP obtained by the inventors is disclosed in . The vapor pressure is high for TATP because it evaporates at a very fast rate approximately five per cent 5 of its weight within a few days .

The measured absorption optical spectrum of TATP vapor as a function of optical frequency cm obtained by the inventors is very large as graphically depicted in and can be used for detection of TATP clouds.

In the graphical depiction of the strong optical absorption due to TATP is seen near 3.3 microns 8.2 microns and 10.6 microns.

A DIAL parameter study indicates that the absorption spectrum of TATP is readily observable against the spectrum of the atmosphere. depicts the superimposed spectrum of a 1 m diameter cloud of TATP with that of the ambient atmosphere path length of 100 m .

DIAL calculations indicate that a TATP cloud associated with a TATP explosive sample is detectable at ranges up to four hundred meters 400 m .

COlasers have the appropriate tuning range to provide off line 10.2 micron not absorbed and on line 10.6 micron absorbed wavelengths for DIAL detection of TATP.

Quantum cascade lasers are tunable lasers and operate near 8.2 microns and 3.3 microns and can be tuned on line and off line of the TATP absorption features.

Optical parametric oscillator lasers operate near 3.3 microns and near 8.2 microns and near 10.6 microns and can be used for TATP DIAL detection.

The strong optical absorption features of TATP near 3.3 8.2 and 10.6 microns can be detected by using a FT IR or other spectroscopic detection instrument that would measure the TATP absorption of natural sunlight or ambient lighting illuminating a target behind the TATP cloud or measuring the differential radiance of the thermal radiation absorbed by the TATP cloud compared to the thermal emission of the background scene.
