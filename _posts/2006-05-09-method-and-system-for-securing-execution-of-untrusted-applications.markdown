title: Method and system for securing execution of untrusted applications
abstract: In accordance with embodiments, there are provided mechanisms and methods for securing execution of untrusted applications. These mechanisms and methods for securing execution of untrusted applications can enable embodiments to provide a “sandbox” environment in which applications that are less than trusted may execute. The ability of embodiments to provide such a protected environment for executing these untrusted applications can enable systems designers and system programmers to provide additional applications from third parties to users without being overly concerned about system security issues.

The following commonly owned co pending United States Patent Application is related to the present application and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety 

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 430 723 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROTECTING APIs FROM UNTRUSTED OR LESS TRUSTED APPLICATIONS by Neil Smithline filed on May 9 2006.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The current invention relates generally to application servers and more particularly to a mechanism for securing execution of untrusted applications.

In an application server model an application server provides access to a variety of applications to users throughout an Enterprise Information System EIS essentially the data processing power of an enterprise as well as to users connecting with the application server from remote locations. Java an interpreted language enables the creation of applications that could be run on a wide variety of platforms. This ability to function across a variety of different client platforms i.e. platform independence and Java s relatively easy implementation of network applications has resulted in the use of Java as well as other programming languages that provide platform independence in conjunction with application servers to provide processing power in endeavors as basic as personal web pages to endeavors as complex as large business to business enterprise systems.

One key component of application server technology is security. However conventional security models are designed to provide access to all internal Application Programming Interfaces APIs to any installed application. Thus such conventional security models are capable of securing execution only of trusted applications. Such applications include exclusively trusted code i.e. code provided by a trusted provider under agreement. Accordingly conventional approaches are restricted to the use of trusted applications installed on conventional application servers.

The invention is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. References to embodiments in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment and such references mean at least one. While specific implementations are discussed it is understood that this is done for illustrative purposes only. A person skilled in the relevant art will recognize that other components and configurations may be used without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough description of the invention. However it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known features have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the invention.

Although a diagram may depict components as logically separate such depiction is merely for illustrative purposes. It can be apparent to those skilled in the art that the components portrayed can be combined or divided into separate software firmware and or hardware components. For example one or more of the embodiments described herein can be implemented in a network accessible device appliance such as a router. Furthermore it can also be apparent to those skilled in the art that such components regardless of how they are combined or divided can execute on the same computing device or can be distributed among different computing devices connected by one or more networks or other suitable communication means.

In accordance with embodiments there are provided mechanisms and methods for securing execution of untrusted applications. These mechanisms and methods for securing execution of untrusted applications can enable embodiments to provide a sandbox environment in which applications that are less than trusted may execute. The ability of embodiments to provide such a protected environment for executing these untrusted applications can enable systems designers and system programmers to provide additional applications from third parties to users without being overly concerned about system security issues.

In an embodiment and by way of example a method for interoperable management of application servers is provided. The method embodiment includes receiving from an untrusted application a request to access a class. The method embodiment includes determining whether the class is permitted to be accessed by untrusted applications. The untrusted application may be permitted to access the class when the class is one that is permitted to be accessed by untrusted applications.

In another embodiment and by way of example a method for securing execution of untrusted applications is provided. The method embodiment includes sending from an untrusted application a request to an application server to access a class maintained by the application server with an internal API separate from a public API of the application server. Permission to access the class may be received when the application server has determined that the class is permitted to be accessed by untrusted applications.

As used herein the term untrusted application refers to any application that falls short in some way of meeting the requirements of a trusted application. While trusted applications include exclusively trusted code i.e. code provided by a trusted provider under agreement or tested to a specification untrusted applications can include applications or other code provided by third parties not bound contractually or otherwise to meet standards or interface requirements of software executing on the application server. Some examples of instances where use of untrusted applications would be desirable include without limitation 

While the present invention is described with reference to an embodiment in which techniques for securing execution of untrusted applications are implemented in an application server in conformance with the J2EE Management Framework using executable programs written in the Java programming language the present invention is not limited to the J2EE Management Framework nor the Java programming language. Embodiments may be practiced using other interconnectivity specifications or programming languages i.e. JSP and the like without departing from the scope of the embodiments claimed. Java is a trademark of Sun Microsystems Inc. .

As shown in an application server that employs a J2EE management framework provides a mechanism in which one or more applications can execute using resources available on the application server . In one embodiment the application server utilize an application server product such as WebLogic Server by BEA systems of San Jose Calif.

In an embodiment an application server s internal APIs may be maintained in separate classes than public APIs to facilitate protecting these APIs. While application specific exceptions can exist such separation is generally enforced. Once internal APIs are in separate classes from public APIs embodiments can protect internal classes i.e. classes that have only internal methods on them from accesses by untrusted applications. Embodiments may protect internal classes either by using a modified existing application classloader or adding a new classloader for applications that by default denies access to internal methods. A method embodiment for protecting the internal classes will be described with reference to .

If the classloader is configured to lookup in application last block then lookup class in the parent application server classloader prior to looking up the class in the local application classloader and return if found blocks .

In an embodiment the filter list contains exactly the classes that are documented in javadoc. The weblogic .xml files will allow appending to the filter list for that unit e.g. weblogic ejb jar.xml adds to the filter list for the ejb.jar file weblogic application.jar for the entire ear .

Integration for layered products can comprise two facets. The first facet includes allowing layered products to co exist with the filtering classloader and still be able to call APIs familiar to the layered product. Certain extensions to weblogic .xml files could be used to handle this case. The second facet of layered product integration includes allowing layered products to extend this solution to protect the layered product s internal APIs from application code.

In another embodiment access to secured JDK APIs may be closed by integrating application server components with J2SE security. To demonstrate the advantages of such integration an overview of J2SE security in general is provided. A more detailed description can be found in the Java 2 Platform Security Architecture Specification.

Each class in Java has associated with it a codebase . This roughly corresponds to the element of the classpath from which the class was loaded. There is a policy file that contains mappings of permissions to codebases. For example 

This gives any class loaded from mylib.jar permission to read the file foo bar. Many operations within the JVM are secured including file I O network operations JVM property system operations classloader operations and the like. When a program tries to execute a secured operation an access check occurs. Consider the following call stack with associated set of permissions the notation of the method name and relevant parameters on the left and any relevant permissions on the right is used throughout 

 Note that pseudocode is used throughout for clarity. For example there is no method File.read it is clear to the ordinary skilled person what it would do if it existed. When the read call executes it begins to walk the stack and intersects the permissions for its callers. In this case there is only a single caller. Once it is done and has obtained the intersected set of permissions it sees if the intersected set of permissions implies the desired set of permissions and if so permits the operation.

For the sake of this example consider a method in an application server updateLogFile that writes to a log file. Now consider this simplified snippet from an embodiment s policy file 

 AllPermission means all permissions. When intersected with any set of permissions X it results in the initial set of permissions X. So consider this pseudo realistic call stack 

When J2SE security is enabled this call will fail because the userApplication.war does not have write permission to logFile and this frame is on the stack and will be included in the intersection of permissions. So one solution is to tell customers to grant a whole slew of permissions to all applications thereby watering down J2SE security to no real protection at all. J2SE does provide for a much better solution that involves code modification. This involves using a marker class called PrivilegedAction that is like Runnable but with a different name. To use this one would need to replace 

While this does not change the logic of the execution it does act as a marker to the J2SE security. When the intersection algorithm runs into a call to AccessController.doPrivileged it proceeds to intersect one more frame s permission and then stops. So in the new call stack 

The work required to protect the secured JDK operations is to wrap calls to secure JDK APIs that are occurring on behalf of the application server in doPrivileged calls. By on behalf of the application server it is intended to mean that the user has not asked the server to execute a secure JDK operation explicitly for them. Rather as in the case of the logging example above the user has performed some application server operation and one or more secure JDK operations must happen during the execution of the application server operation. In an embodiment some PrivilegedAction pooling mechanism can be put in place to ensure that there is not a performance degradation by object creation.

Layered products need very little integration with such a solution. One component that layered products need to do is to be able to escalate their own privileges which layered products could achieve via deployment descriptor attributes.
