The present invention relates generally to an improved data processing system. More specifically the present invention is directed to a computer implemented method system and computer usable program code for creating a non repudiable chat log.

Today most computers are connected to some type of network. A network allows a computer to share information with other computer systems. The Internet is one example of a computer network. There is no doubt that the Internet has changed the way people and businesses communicate. Instant messaging IM is a type of computer application that is designed to facilitate communication among multiple computer users attached to a network such as the Internet.

Instant messaging may be implemented in various ways but in general instant messaging supports the sending and receiving of instant messages to and from other users. Instant messages are correspondence that appears on a computer display of a recipient more or less instantaneously after being sent. This is opposed to the more traditional e mail messages which typically are logged in a system until a recipient wishes to view them. The ability to receive correspondence almost instantly gives instant messaging a more spontaneous conversational quality than does traditional e mail. A variety of users such as groups of individuals working closely together on some critical project or more casual users at home wanting to see if someone is available to receive an immediate message may use instant messaging applications.

Normally instant messaging involves two people online sending notes back and forth to each other. Sending an instant message opens up a small window display on each computer interface so that both individuals involved in the process may type in and read messages. A chat room is a software program that allows a group of people to communicate with each other by allowing each member of the group to type in messages that are seen by everyone in the chat room. An instant messaging system generally comprises a plurality of instant messaging client devices coupled to an instant messaging server via a data processing system network. Messages and connection information is maintained on the server that is controlled by a provider of the instant messaging service. Examples of instant messaging services are Lotus Sametime Microsoft Network MSN Messenger Sun ONE Instant Messenger AOL Instant Messenger AIM and Yahoo Messenger .

Unfortunately criminals are taking advantage of this instant messaging technology to perpetrate cyber crime such as for example sexual predators looking for minor victims online and online phishing scams. The term phishing alludes to the use of increasingly sophisticated online lures to fish for users financial information passwords and other sensitive personal information. Since cyber crime is quickly maturing law enforcement officials are actively seeking to prosecute these types of criminals. When evidence of a crime takes place during an online chat session prosecutors may introduce the chat log of that chat session as evidence in a court of law against the alleged criminal.

A chat session is one entire online instant messaging conversation between individuals or a group of individuals over a period of time. A chat log is a record of that entire chat session which includes for example the date time and text of all sent and received messages along with the screen name of the sender. However currently the value of a chat log as evidence of criminal activity in a court of law depends on the reputation of the law enforcement officer that engaged in that particular chat session. This chat log evidence will be given greater weight in court if it can be shown that no one had an opportunity to tamper with the chat log prior to the prosecutor presenting the chat log as evidence at trial.

Therefore it would be beneficial to have a computer implemented method apparatus and computer usable program code for creating a non repudiable chat log that greatly decreases any question of tampering and increases credibility of the gathered evidence.

Illustrative embodiments provide a computer implemented method system and computer usable program code for creating a non repudiable chat log. An initial quote is performed of a value of a register in response to a secure chat session being initiated. The value of the register is extended to record a message measurement within the register for the secure chat session in response to a message being measured. A final quote is performed of the value of the register in response to the secure chat session being terminated.

With reference now to an exemplary block diagram illustrating components used in managing instant messages is depicted in accordance with illustrative embodiments. Instant messaging system may for example include instant messaging clients and instant messaging server process and user database . However it should be noted that is only intended for the purpose of illustration and does not imply any architectural limitations on illustrative embodiments. Illustrative embodiments may include any components necessary to accomplish the task of creating a reputable chat log.

In the illustrative example of a user utilizing instant messaging client may exchange instant messages over a network with other users utilizing instant messaging client and or instant messaging client . For example client may exchange messages over network with client and or client in . The exchanging of messages may for example be via instant messaging broadcast messaging or any other synchronous messaging system that may be utilized by illustrative embodiments. Broadcast messaging provides a means for instantaneously sending a single message to all members of a predefined community of instant messaging clients.

Instant messaging clients and may be executing on a data processing system such as for example data processing system in . It should be noted that even though the exemplary illustration of depicts three instant messaging clients illustrative embodiments are not restricted to such. For example an entity using processes of illustrative embodiments may employ fewer or more instant messaging clients as necessary to complete the mission of the entity.

Instant messaging server process may be located in a server such as for example server in . In addition instant messaging server process may be executing on a data processing system such as for example data processing system in . Instant messaging server process facilitates the process of instant messaging by allowing the user of instant messaging client to find the user of instant messaging client and or the user of instant messaging client within instant messaging system as well as aiding in the exchange of instant messages between the different users of instant messaging clients and . Depending on the implementation of instant messaging system instant messaging server process may for example only provide an indication of when users of instant messaging clients and are currently online and establish initial contacts.

User database stores user data. In this illustrative example instant messaging system utilizes user database to store data regarding registration information for the different users of instant messaging clients and . Instant messaging server process may for example use this stored registration information within user database to search for and find currently online users of instant messaging clients and as well as other users that are currently online to facilitate the exchange of instant messages.

With reference now an exemplary block diagram illustrating components of an instant messaging client device is depicted in accordance with illustrative embodiments. A user utilizes instant messaging client to exchange instant messages with other users currently online within an instant messaging system such as for example instant messaging system in . Instant messaging client may for example be instant messaging client in . Instant messaging client includes graphical user interface GUI instant messaging application application programming interface API operating system OS trusted platform module TPM and platform configuration register PCR . However it should be noted that is only shown for illustration purposes and is not meant as a limitation on illustrative embodiments. Illustrative embodiments may include any hardware software and or firmware components necessary to accomplish the task of creating a reputable chat log. Also it should be noted that illustrative embodiments may reside in one or more instant messaging client devices connected to the instant messaging system such as instant messaging clients and connected with instant messaging system in .

A user of instant messaging client utilizes graphical user interface to interact with applications residing in instant messaging client such as for example instant messaging application . A graphical user interface is a graphics based user interface that incorporates movable windows and icons which may be manipulated by a mouse or a keyboard. Typically a graphical user interface is the standard way a user interacts with a computer.

The user employs instant messaging application to connect to and access an instant messaging server over the network. For example instant messaging client utilizes an instant messaging application to access instant messaging server process in . Instant messaging application may be any instant messaging application that illustrative embodiments may utilize to access an instant messaging server.

Application programming interface allows the user of instant messaging client which may be an individual or a software routine to invoke system capabilities using a standard consistent interface without concern for how the particular functionality is implemented.

Instant messaging application may for example run on operating system . Instant messaging application represents any number of software applications designed to react to data to provide the desired functionality the user seeks. The software applications represented by instant messaging application may include those software applications necessary to handle data video graphics photos and or text.

Instant messaging application may for example measure each incoming and outgoing instant message after a user manually initiates a secure instant messaging chat session within instant messaging application . Alternatively instant messaging application may automatically initiate a secure instant messaging chat session for every instant messaging session unless otherwise instructed by the user. A secure instant messaging chat session according to this illustrative embodiment is an instant messaging chat session that requires platform configuration register to record a sequenced measurement of each incoming and outgoing instant message within platform configuration register . Instant messaging application uses the recorded sequenced measurement of each incoming and outgoing instant message within platform configuration register to verify that a non repudiable chat log of the entire instant messaging chat session has been created. A non repudiable or reputable chat log is a chat log that is free from any question of tampering or modification by an individual either during the instant messaging chat session or after the instant messaging chat session is terminated. The chat log records the entire chat session which includes for example the date time and text of all sent and received instant messages along with the screen name of the sender of the instant message. However it should be noted that illustrative embodiments are not restricted to the above listed items in a chat log. Illustrative embodiments may include any data necessary in the chat log to accomplish processes of illustrative embodiments.

Instant messaging application extends the current value of platform configuration register in order to record each incoming and outgoing instant message measurement to form the sequenced measurement of the entire secure chat session. Furthermore instant messaging application makes calls to periodically quote the current value of platform configuration register for future comparison and verification purposes. For example instant messaging application makes a call to quote the current value of platform configuration register at the start of the secure chat session at the end of the secure chat session and at predetermined intervals between the start and end of the secure chat session. Of course it should be noted that instant messaging application may automatically make calls to periodically quote the current value of platform configuration register at predetermined times or a user of instant messaging client may manually instruct instant messaging application to make a call to quote the current value of platform configuration register at any time. A quote is information on or a record of the value of platform configuration register at the time instant messaging application makes a call to perform the quote.

Operating system is utilized to provide high level functionality to the user and to other software. Such an operating system typically includes a basic input output system. Operating system and instant messaging application may employ user input devices in order to obtain input from the user. User input devices may for example include a mouse a keyboard or any other input device known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A user may utilize the user input devices to type instant messages in a text box and set user preferences in a preference window displayed on graphical user interface .

A processor such as for example processor in performs the basic operations in instant messaging client . The processor may for example display information on graphical user interface . Graphical user interface has a plurality of picture elements collectively referred to as a screen which may define the appearance of a user interface environment displayed on graphical user interface . Graphical user interface screen contents and therefore the appearance of the user interface environment may be controlled or altered by instant messaging application and or operating system .

Trusted platform module resides on a motherboard that is contained within instant messaging client . Trusted platform module is a microcontroller or integrated circuit that stores secured data and conforms to the trusted platform module specification put forward by the Trusted Computing Group TCG . Trusted computing is a technology developed and promoted by the Trusted Computing Group. Trusted means that the system may be trusted more fully to follow the system s intended programming with a lower possibility of inappropriate activity occurring.

However it should be noted that illustrative embodiments are not restricted to trusted platform module residing on the motherboard. For example illustrative embodiments may use a software application to create trusted platform module as a virtual trusted platform module that does not require any hardware component. Alternatively illustrative embodiments may utilize a combination of hardware and software components to create trusted platform module .

Trusted platform module provides an environment for protected cryptographic functions to execute without modification or exposing cryptographic key information. Trusted platform module also attests to the current status of both trusted platform module and the platform on which trusted platform module resides which is instant messaging client . Trusted platform module may for example protect secrets within instant messaging client perform cryptographic functions create store and manage cryptographic keys provide a unique endorsement key perform digital signature operations and hold instant messaging client measurements.

Platform configuration register resides within trusted platform module . Trusted platform module holds platform configuration register in volatile storage within trusted platform module . A register is a small high speed circuit that is used as a storage location to hold values of internal operations and data being processed. Platform configuration register represents a plurality of platform configuration registers.

Platform configuration register may for example store platform integrity measurements for instant messaging client in a way that prevents misrepresentation. Platform configuration register values play an important role in several trusted platform module functions such as for example sealed storage attestation and platform boot. During boot of instant messaging client trusted platform module gathers measurements about the running environment. Trusted platform module performs a hash logs the data and extends the value of an appropriate platform configuration register to record the gathered measurement data about the running environment.

In cryptography a one way hash function such as for example secure hash algorithm 1 SHA 1 is an algorithm that generates a fixed string of numbers from a test message. One way means that it is extremely difficult to turn the fixed string back into the text message. A one way hash function is used for creating digital signatures for message authentication. A digital signature is a digital guarantee that information or data has not been tampered with or modified. The digital signature acts as if the information is protected by a tamper proof seal that is broken only if the content is altered. A remote entity may decide whether to trust instant messaging client based on the platform configuration register values.

Changes to the computing environment of instant messaging client requires updates to the platform configuration registers. The value of a platform configuration register may be changed in one of two ways reset or extend. A chipset limits which platform configuration registers may be reset. When instant messaging application extends the value of platform configuration register platform configuration register does not loose its previous context. Extending the value of platform configuration register simulates an infinite log or a series of measurements. The new platform configuration register value hash is computed over the concatenation of the old platform configuration register value and the value to add.

Presently a large number of computers are manufactured with trusted platform modules integrated onto the computers motherboard. This Trusted Computing Group technology may be used for example to verify the integrity of evidence collected by law enforcement personnel while conducting online conversations or instant messaging chat sessions with suspects. A prosecutor may present the chat logs of these instant messaging chat sessions with suspected criminals as evidence in court of criminal activity or intent. However the integrity of the chat log data collected currently depends upon the credibility of the law enforcement personnel involved. It has been shown in high profile cases that a judge may not allow even solid evidence such as DNA matching if the defense demonstrates that an opportunity existed for the evidence to be corrupted either deliberately or through negligence. The use of a non repudiable chat log greatly decreases or eliminates any question of tampering and therefore adds credibility to the gathered chat log data. Illustrative embodiments prevent secure chat log files from being undetectably tampered with during the secure chat session or after the secure chat session has completed by verifying that each platform configuration register value quote is signed by trusted platform module and by re measuring each recorded incoming and outgoing instant message in the chat log to compare the re measurement value with the initial intermediate and or final platform configuration register quote values to determine tampering during and after the secure chat session.

At the time instant messaging client is manufactured the manufacturer creates an Endorsement Key EK within trusted platform module . The user of instant messaging client which has trusted platform module embedded on the motherboard requests an attestation identity key AIK from a certification authority CA . A certification authority is an organization that issues digital certificates. In order for the certification authority to grant the attestation identity key the user of instant messaging client must prove that trusted platform module is the original trusted platform module for instant messaging client .

The endorsement key is the root key for establishing the identity of trusted platform module to obtain the attestation identity key from the certification authority. As stated above the endorsement key is generated only once at the time of manufacture. The user of trusted platform module may enable disable access to the endorsement key. If the user disables or wipes out the endorsement key the user loses the ability to get an attestation identity key. In addition the user may set trusted platform module as enabled disabled active inactive and owned unowned. In order for instant messaging client to successfully attest to a chat log as being non repudiable trusted platform module must be enabled active and owned.

At the start of a secure instant messaging chat session instant messaging application automatically requests a quote of the current value of platform configuration register . The current value quote of platform configuration register is signed by trusted platform module s attestation identity key. Then instant messaging application measures each incoming instant message received and each outgoing instant message sent during the secure instant messaging chat session and extends the value of platform configuration register in order to record each incoming and outgoing instant message measurement within platform configuration register itself to form a sequenced measurement of the entire secure chat session.

In addition instant messaging application may request periodic quotes of the current value of platform configuration register at predetermined intervals during the secure instant messaging chat session as additional check points to verify that subsets of the secure chat session are not modified or tampered with while the secure chat session is in progress. At the end of the secure instant messaging chat session instant messaging application requests a final quote of the current value of platform configuration register . In this manner instant messaging client maintains a chat log which includes the entire contents of the secure instant messaging chat session and a measurement log which includes measurements of each incoming and outgoing instant message and each platform configuration register value quote. Thus instant messaging application may verify that the chat log is not altered by re measuring the measurement log and checking that each quoted platform configuration register value quote is signed by a valid attestation identity key.

The benefit of appending each incoming and outgoing instant message measurement to platform configuration register is that a sequential measurement of the entire secure chat session is produced that is easily compared with the re measurements of the incoming and outgoing instant messages to determine if tampering occurred either during the secure chat session or after the secure chat session is terminated. In an alternative illustrative embodiment incoming and outgoing network packets containing instant messages may be measured and logged in a tcpdump format. Tcpdump is widely used and is installed as part of the default tools on many computer systems. In addition there are many tools that integrate the pcap library which is able to read tcpdump output files. By default tcpdump puts a network interface such as for example network adapter in into promiscuous mode to capture every packet going across the network. In this way almost any instant messaging client device may be utilized to perform this packet measuring and logging function but the chat log file will be larger and the verification process will take longer because more measurements will need to be verified.

Whichever logging method is chosen the chat logs are determined to be valid or invalid by starting at the initial platform configuration register value quote re measuring every logged instant message in the chat log calculating a new platform configuration register value for each logged instant message in the chat log until the final message is reached comparing the final re measurement value with the final platform configuration register value quote recorded at the end of the chat log and verifying that the attestation identity key signature on each platform configuration register value quote is valid. If any of the attestation identity key signatures are invalid or the final platform configuration register value quote does not match the final re measurement value then the chat log has been tampered with or modified.

With reference now to an exemplary block diagram illustrating an instant messaging application is depicted in accordance with illustrative embodiments. The components shown in may for example be found in an instant messaging application that resides within an instant messaging client such as instant messaging application that resides within instant messaging client in . Instant messaging application includes message dialog window contact and control window and contact list . However is only intended for illustration purposes and is not meant as a limitation on illustrative embodiments. Illustrative embodiments may include more or fewer components to instant messaging application that are necessary to accomplish processes of illustrative embodiments.

Instant messaging application processes message . Message may be an incoming instant message or an outgoing instant message. To process message instant messaging application measures message extends a platform configuration register such as platform configuration register in to form a sequenced measurement of the secure chat session and adds message to a chat log.

Further instant messaging application displays incoming message in dialog window on a GUI such as GUI in for the user to read. Additionally dialog window provides an interface for the user to input text in order to draft outgoing message . Then instant messaging application sends outgoing message over a network such as network in to another instant messaging client device utilizing the instant messaging system such as instant messaging client utilizing instant messaging system in .

Instant messaging application presents contact and control window to provide the user with a contact list of user names as well as other information. Contact and control window also provides an interface to allow the user to set different preferences. For example the user may set passwords required to access different names used in instant messaging chat sessions. Additionally the user may set a preference to link the instant messaging application to another application within the data processing system such as a security application.

Further the user may use contact and control window to set other preferences such as alerts colors and fonts used in instant messaging application . These preferences also may include whether a picture is to be sent when an instant messaging session is initiated with another user. Depending on the implementation the preference may be set to allow a user who receives messages to retrieve images of the senders from a remote database such as user database in or a local cache.

In addition contact and control window stores in contact list a list of names presented by contact and control window in these examples. The user may edit contact list by adding to or deleting from contact list other users. Contact list is utilized for presenting the list of names within contact and control window .

With reference now to a flowchart illustrating an exemplary process for creating a reputable chat log is shown in accordance with illustrative embodiments. The process shown in may be implemented in an instant messaging client device such as for example instant messaging client in .

The process begins when an instant messaging application such as for example instant messaging application in automatically initiates a secure instant messaging chat session for an online instant messaging conversation between a user of the instant messaging client device and another individual or individuals that are online as well. step . Alternatively the user may manually initiate the secure instant messaging chat session for the online conversation. Subsequent to initiating the secure instant messaging chat session in step the instant messaging application performs an initial quote of the current value of a platform configuration register such as for example platform configuration register in step .

After performing the initial quote of the current value of a platform configuration register in step the instant messaging application makes a determination as to whether the instant messaging application has received an incoming instant message or is ready to send an outgoing instant message step . If the instant messaging application has not received an incoming instant message or is not ready to send an outgoing instant message no output of step then the process returns to step where the instant messaging application waits to process an incoming or outgoing instant message. If the instant messaging application has received an incoming instant message or is ready to send an outgoing instant message yes output of step then the instant messaging application measures the incoming or outgoing instant message step .

Subsequent to measuring the incoming or outgoing instant message in step the instant messaging application extends the current value of the platform configuration register to record the incoming or outgoing instant message measurement within the platform configuration register to form a sequenced measurement of the secure instant messaging chat session step . After extending the platform configuration value in step the instant messaging application adds the incoming or outgoing instant message to a chat log step . Then the instant messaging application either displays the incoming instant message in a dialog window such as for example dialog window in within a GUI such as for example GUI in on the instant messaging client device for the user to read or sends the outgoing instant message over a network such as network in to another instant messaging client device utilizing the instant messaging system such as instant messaging client utilizing instant messaging system in step .

Subsequent to displaying the incoming instant message or sending the outgoing instant message in step the instant messaging application makes a determination as to whether the instant messaging application needs to automatically perform another predetermined periodic platform configuration register value quote step . Alternatively the user may manually instruct the instant messaging application to perform another platform configuration register value quote. If the instant messaging application needs to perform another platform configuration register value quote yes output of step then the process returns to step where the instant messaging application performs a platform configuration value quote. If the instant messaging application does not need to perform another platform configuration register value quote no output of step then the instant messaging application makes a determination as to whether the secure instant messaging chat session is terminated step .

If the secure instant messaging chat session is not terminated no output of step then the process returns to step where the instant messaging application waits to process another incoming or outgoing instant message. If the secure instant messaging chat session is terminated yes output of step then the instant messaging application performs a final platform configuration register value quote step . After performing the final platform configuration register value quote in step the instant messaging application verifies that each platform configuration register value quote is signed by a valid attestation identity key and re measures the chat log entries to compare with the quoted values to determine tampering or modification of the chat log step .

Subsequent to verifying the platform configuration values are signed and re measuring the chat log to determine tampering in step the instant messaging application automatically stores the non repudiable chat log of the secure instant messaging chat session and the platform configuration value quotes in a non volatile storage device such as for example read only memory hard disk or compact disc read only memory in or storage in step . Alternatively the user may manually direct the instant messaging application to store the non repudiable chat log of the secure instant messaging chat session and the platform configuration value quotes in a non volatile storage device such as for example a diskette. Then the user may direct the instant messaging client device to send the stored reputable chat log and platform configuration value quotes to the other party or parties involved with the online instant messaging conversation or to some other third party or entity such as for example the district attorney s office step . Further it should be noted that the entity receiving the reputable chat log and platform configuration value quotes may perform the verification process of step in addition to the instant messaging client device or instead of the instant messaging client device. The process terminates thereafter.
