This non provisional application filed under 37 CFR 1.53 b is a continuation in part claiming the benefit under 35 USC 120 of U.S. non provisional application Ser. No. 11 311 591 filed 29 Nov. 2005 and which claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 632 613 filed on 1 Dec. 2004 both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The invention relates generally to compounds with anti cancer activity and more specifically to heterocyclic substituted bis 1 8 naphthalimide chemotherapeutic drugs and bis 1 8 naphthalimide chemotherapeutic drugs conjugated to antibodies. The invention also relates to methods of using the compounds for in vitro in situ and in vivo treatment of mammalian cells or associated pathological conditions.

Improving the delivery of drugs and other agents to target cells tissues and tumors to achieve maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity has been the focus of considerable research for many years. Though many attempts have been made to develop effective methods for importing biologically active molecules into cells both in vivo and in vitro none has proved to be entirely satisfactory. Optimizing the association of the drug with its intracellular target while minimizing intercellular redistribution of the drug e.g. to neighboring cells is often difficult or inefficient.

Monoclonal antibody therapy has been established for the targeted treatment of patients with cancer immunological and angiogenic disorders. One example HERCEPTIN trastuzumab Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. is a recombinant DNA derived humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity in a cell based assay Kd 5 nM to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor2 protein HER2 ErbB2 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 U.S. Pat. No. 6 054 297 U.S. Pat. No. 6 407 213 U.S. Pat. No. 6 639 055 Coussens L et al 1985 Science 230 1132 9 Slamon D J et al 1989 Science 244 707 12 . Trastuzumab is an IgG1 kappa antibody that contains human framework regions with the complementarity determining regions cdr of a murine antibody 4D5 that binds to HER2. Trastuzumab binds to the HER2 antigen and thus inhibits the growth of cancerous cells. Because Trastuzumab is a humanized antibody it minimizes any HAMA Human Anti Mouse Antibody response in patients. Trastuzumab has been shown in both in vitro assays and in animals to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2 Hudziak R M et al 1989 Mol Cell Biol 9 1165 72 Lewis G D et al 1993 Cancer Immunol Immunother 37 255 63 Baselga J et al 1998 Cancer Res. 58 2825 2831 . Trastuzumab is a mediator of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC Hotaling T E et al 1996 abstract . Proc. Annual Meeting Am Assoc Cancer Res 37 471 Pegram M D et al 1997 abstract . Proc Am Assoc Cancer Res 38 602 . In vitro Trastuzumab mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. HERCEPTIN as a single agent is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein and who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. HERCEPTIN in combination with paclitaxel is indicated for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein and who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. HERCEPTIN is clinically active in patients with ErbB2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that have received extensive prior anti cancer therapy Baselga et al 1996 J. Clin. Oncol. 14 737 744 .

The use of antibody drug conjugates ADC i.e. immunoconjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 Anticancer Research 19 605 614 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 1997 Adv. Drg Del. Rev. 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 theoretically allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. 1986 Lancet pp. Mar. 15 1986 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications A. Pinchera et al. ed.s pp. 475 506 . Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Efforts to design and refine ADC have focused on the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies mAbs as well as drug linking and drug releasing properties. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 1986 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21 183 87 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al 2000 Bioorganic Med. Chem. Letters 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al 2002 Bioconjugate Chem. 13 786 791 maytansinoids US 20050169933 A1 EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 and calicheamicin Lode et al 1998 Cancer Res. 58 2928 Hinman et al 1993 Cancer Res. 53 3336 3342 . The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

DNA intercalation is a proposed mechanism for inhibiting the progression of tumorigenesis. Bis 1 8 naphthalimide compounds strongly bind DNA and may disrupt the DNA topoisomerase II complex Bailly et al 2003 Biochemistry 42 4136 4150 by stacking with purine nucleobases on opposite strands Gallego et al 1999 Biochemistry 38 46 15104 15115 .

The investigational antitumor drug bis 1 8 naphthalimide mesylate LU79553 also known as elinafide dimesylate N N bis 1 8 naphthalimido ethyl 1 3 diaminopropane bismethane sulfonate or N N Bis 2 1 3 dioxo 2 3 dihydro 1H benz de isoquinolin 2 yl ethyl 1 3 diaminopropane dimethanesulfonate 2 2 Propane 1 3 diylbis iminoethylene bis 2 3 dihydro 1H benz de isoquinoline 1 3 dione dimethanesulfonate Abbott Laboratories Knoll A G Ludwigshafen D E is composed of two tricyclic 1 8 naphthalimide chromophores separated by an aminoalkyl linker chain and designed to permit bisintercalation of the drug into DNA Villalona Calero et al 2001 Jour. Clinical Oncology 19 3 857 869 Bousquet et al 1995 Cancer Res. 55 1176 1180 U.S. Pat. No. 4 874 863 U.S. Pat. No. 5 416 089 U.S. Pat. No. 5 616 589 U.S. Pat. No. 5 789 418 WO 95 05365 . Clinical trials with Elinafide were conducted in Germany Awada et al 2003 Euro. J. of Cancer 39 6 742 747 . Unlike most other known topoisomerase II inhibitors elinafide does not cause significant DNA cleavage suggesting Elinafide inhibits topoisomerase II via a different mechanism. This could mean that cancer cells resistant to coventional topoisomerase II inhibitors may not be cross resistant to elinafide. Elinafide also inhibits topoisomerase I isolated from calf thymus with and IC50 value of 5 Molar assessed by a supercoiled DNA relaxation assay. In mouse xenograft models repeated dosing regimens with elinafide demonstrated antitumor activity and did not demonstrate a strong schedule dependency Bousquet et al 1995 Cancer Res. 55 1176 1180 . In human xenograft models complete regression of MX 1 mammary carcinoma xenografts was observed when LU 79553 was administered iv for five daily doses at 20 mg kg 2 cycles beginning on days 6 and 20 or every 3 days for two doses at 55 mg kg 2 cycles beginning on days 6 and 13 or weekly for four doses Bousquet et al 1995 Cancer Res. 55 1176 1180 . Elinafide has been shown to be curative also in human melanoma LOX models and give partial and complete tumor regression as well as some cures in human lung LX 1 and human colon CX 1 carcinoma xenograft models.

Reference will now be made in detail to certain exemplary embodiments of the invention examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying structures drawings figures formulas and Examples. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the enumerated embodiments it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the invention to those embodiments. The discussion below is descriptive illustrative and exemplary and is not to be taken as limiting the scope defined by any appended claims. On the contrary the invention is intended to cover all alternatives modifications and equivalents which may be included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the claims. One skilled in the art will recognize many methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein which could be used in the practice of the present invention. The present invention is in no way limited to the methods and materials described.

Unless defined otherwise technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs and are consistent with Singleton et al. 1994 2. J. Wiley Sons New York N.Y. and Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik 2001 5th Ed. Garland Publishing New York.

When trade names are used herein applicants intend to independently include the trade name product formulation the generic drug and the active pharmaceutical ingredient s of the trade name product.

Unless stated otherwise the following terms and phrases as used herein are intended to have the following meanings 

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. Antibodies may be murine human humanized chimeric or derived from other species.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies fragments produced by a Fab expression library anti idiotypic anti Id antibodies CDR complementary determining region and epitope binding fragments of any of the above which immunospecifically bind to cancer cell antigens viral antigens or microbial antigens single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

An intact antibody herein is one comprising a VL and VH domains as well as complete light and heavy chain constant domains.

An antibody is a protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding to a specific antigen. Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik 2001 5th Ed. Garland Publishing New York . A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites also called epitopes recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus one antigen may have more than one corresponding antibody.

The term antibody as used herein also refers to a full length immunoglobulin molecule or an immunologically active portion of a full length immunoglobulin molecule i.e. a molecule that contains an antigen binding site that immunospecifically binds an antigen of a target of interest or part thereof such targets including but not limited to cancer cell or cells that produce autoimmune antibodies associated with an autoimmune disease. The immunoglobulin disclosed herein can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD and IgA class e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2 or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. The immunoglobulins can be derived from any species. In one aspect however the immunoglobulin is of human murine or rabbit origin.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al 1975 256 495 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods see U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al 1991 Nature 352 624 628 Marks et al 1991 J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597 for example.

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al 1984 81 6851 6855 . Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a non human primate e.g. Old World Monkey Ape etc and human constant region sequences.

Various methods have been employed to produce monoclonal antibodies MAbs . Hybridoma technology which refers to a cloned cell line that produces a single type of antibody uses the cells of various species including mice murine hamsters rats and humans. Another method to prepare MAbs uses genetic engineering including recombinant DNA techniques. Monoclonal antibodies made from these techniques include among others chimeric antibodies and humanized antibodies. A chimeric antibody combines DNA encoding regions from more than one type of species. For example a chimeric antibody may derive the variable region from a mouse and the constant region from a human. A humanized antibody comes predominantly from a human even though it contains nonhuman portions. Like a chimeric antibody a humanized antibody may contain a completely human constant region. But unlike a chimeric antibody the variable region may be partially derived from a human. The nonhuman synthetic portions of a humanized antibody often come from CDRs in murine antibodies. In any event these regions are crucial to allow the antibody to recognize and bind to a specific antigen. While useful for diagnostics and short term therapies murine antibodies cannot be administered to people long term without increasing the risk of a deleterious immunogenic response. This response called Human Anti Mouse Antibody HAMA occurs when a human immune system recognizes the murine antibody as foreign and attacks it. A HAMA response can cause toxic shock or even death.

Chimeric and humanized antibodies reduce the likelihood of a HAMA response by minimizing the nonhuman portions of administered antibodies. Furthermore chimeric and humanized antibodies can have the additional benefit of activating secondary human immune responses such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody e.g. comprising the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab 2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment s .

An intact antibody is one which comprises an antigen binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain CL and heavy chain constant domains CH1 CH2 and CH3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains e.g. human native sequence constant domains or amino acid sequence variant thereof.

The intact antibody may have one or more effector functions which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor BCR etc.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains intact antibodies can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of intact antibodies IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.

Useful non immunoreactive protein polypeptide or peptide antibodies include but are not limited to transferrin epidermal growth factors EGF bombesin gastrin gastrin releasing peptide platelet derived growth factor IL 2 IL 6 transforming growth factors TGF such as TGF and TGF vaccinia growth factor VGF insulin and insulin like growth factors I and II lectins and apoprotein from low density lipoprotein.

Useful polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of immunized animals. Various procedures well known in the art may be used for the production of polyclonal antibodies to an antigen of interest. For example for the production of polyclonal antibodies various host animals can be immunized by injection with an antigen of interest or derivative thereof including but not limited to rabbits mice rats and guinea pigs. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and including but not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete adjuvant mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and corynebacterium parvum. Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.

Useful monoclonal antibodies are homogeneous populations of antibodies to a particular antigenic determinant e.g. a cancer cell antigen a viral antigen a microbial antigen a protein a peptide a carbohydrate a chemical nucleic acid or fragments thereof . A monoclonal antibody mAb to an antigen of interest can be prepared by using any technique known in the art which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by K hler and Milstein 1975 256 495 497 the human B cell hybridoma technique Kozbor et al. 1983 4 72 and the EBV hybridoma technique Cole et al. 1985 Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 . Such antibodies may be of any immunoglobulin class including IgG IgM IgE IgA and IgD and any subclass thereof. The hybridoma producing the mAbs of use in this invention may be cultivated in vitro or in vivo.

Useful monoclonal antibodies include but are not limited to human monoclonal antibodies humanized monoclonal antibodies antibody fragments or chimeric human mouse or other species monoclonal antibodies. Human monoclonal antibodies may be made by any of numerous techniques known in the art e.g. Teng et al. 1983 80 7308 7312 Kozbor et al. 1983 4 72 79 and Olsson et al. 1982 92 3 16 .

The antibody can also be a bispecific antibody. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Milstein et al. 1983 305 537 539 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually performed using affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion may be with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge C2 and C3 regions. The first heavy chain constant region C1 may contain the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. Nucleic acids with sequences encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

Bispecific antibodies may have a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. This asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation WO 94 04690 Suresh et al. 1986 121 210 Rodrigues et al. 1993 151 6954 6961 Carter et al. 1992 10 163 167 Carter et al. 1995 4 463 470 Merchant et al. 1998 16 677 681. Using such techniques bispecific antibodies can be prepared for conjugation as ADC in the treatment or prevention of disease as defined herein.

Hybrid or bifunctional antibodies can be derived either biologically i.e. by cell fusion techniques or chemically especially with cross linking agents or disulfide bridge forming reagents and may comprise whole antibodies or fragments thereof EP 105360 WO 83 03679 EP 217577 .

The antibody can be a functionally active fragment derivative or analog of an antibody that immunospecifically binds to cancer cell antigens viral antigens or microbial antigens or other antibodies bound to tumor cells or matrix. In this regard functionally active means that the fragment derivative or analog is able to elicit anti anti idiotype antibodies that recognize the same antigen that the antibody from which the fragment derivative or analog is derived recognized. Specifically in an exemplary embodiment the antigenicity of the idiotype of the immunoglobulin molecule can be enhanced by deletion of framework and CDR sequences that are C terminal to the CDR sequence that specifically recognizes the antigen. To determine which CDR sequences bind the antigen synthetic peptides containing the CDR sequences can be used in binding assays with the antigen by any binding assay method known in the art e.g. the BIA core assay See for e.g. Kabat et al. 1991 Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. Kabat E et al. 1980 125 3 961 969 .

Other useful antibodies include fragments of antibodies such as but not limited to F ab 2 fragments which contain the variable region the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and Fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab 2 fragments. Other useful antibodies are heavy chain and light chain dimers of antibodies or any minimal fragment thereof such as Fvs or single chain antibodies SCAs e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Bird 1988 Science 242 423 42 Huston et al. 1988 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 5879 5883 and Ward et al. 1989 Nature 334 544 54 or any other molecule with the same specificity as the antibody.

Additionally recombinant antibodies such as chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies comprising both human and non human portions which can be made using standard recombinant DNA techniques are useful antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal and human immunoglobulin constant regions. See e.g. Cabilly et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Boss et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 397 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and a framework region from a human immunoglobulin molecule. See e.g. Queen U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art for example using methods described in WO 87 02671 EP 184 187 EP 171496 EP 173494 WO 86 01533 U.S. Pat.

Completely human antibodies can be produced using transgenic mice that are incapable of expressing endogenous immunoglobulin heavy and light chains genes but which can express human heavy and light chain genes. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar 1995 13 65 93 . For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 569 825 5 661 016 5 545 806 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other human antibodies can be obtained commercially from for example Abgenix Inc. Freemont Calif. and Genpharm San Jose Calif. .

Completely human antibodies that recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as guided selection. In this approach a selected non human monoclonal antibody e.g. a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. Jespers et al. 1994 12 899 903 . Human antibodies can also be produced using various techniques known in the art including phage display libraries Hoogenboom and Winter J. Mol. Biol. 227 381 1991 Marks et al. J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 1991 .

The antibody may be a fusion protein of an antibody or a functionally active fragment thereof for example in which the antibody is fused via a covalent bond e.g. a peptide bond at either the N terminus or the C terminus to an amino acid sequence of another protein or portion thereof such as at least 10 20 or 50 amino acid portion of the protein that is not the antibody. The antibody or fragment thereof may be covalently linked to the other protein at the N terminus of the constant domain.

Antibodies include analogs and derivatives that are either modified i.e. by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule as long as such covalent attachment permits the antibody to retain its antigen binding immunospecificity. For example but not by way of limitation the derivatives and analogs of the antibodies include those that have been further modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular antibody unit or other protein etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin etc. Additionally the analog or derivative can contain one or more unnatural amino acids.

An ErbB receptor is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the ErbB receptor family whose members are mediators of cell growth differentiation and survival. The ErbB receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR ErbB 1 HER1 HER2 ErbB2 or p185 HER3 ErbB3 and HER4 ErbB4 or tyro2 . A panel of anti ErbB2 antibodies has been characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SKBR3 Hudziak et al. 1989 9 3 1165 1172. Maximum inhibition was obtained with the antibody called 4D5 which inhibited cellular proliferation by 56 . Other antibodies in the panel reduced cellular proliferation to a lesser extent in this assay. The antibody 4D5 was further found to sensitize ErbB2 overexpressing breast tumor cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of TNF U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 . The anti ErbB2 antibodies discussed in Hudziak et al. are further characterized in Fendly et al 1990 Cancer Research 50 1550 1558 Kotts et al. 1990 In Vitro 26 3 59A Sarup et al. 1991 Growth Regulation 1 72 82 Shepard et al.

The ErbB receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain which may bind an ErbB ligand a lipophilic transmembrane domain a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and a carboxyl terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. The ErbB receptor may be a native sequence ErbB receptor or an amino acid sequence variant thereof. The ErbB receptor may be a native sequence human ErbB receptor. Accordingly a member of the ErbB receptor family is EGFR ErbB1 ErbB2 ErbB3 ErbB4 or any other ErbB receptor currently known or to be identified in the future.

The terms ErbB1 epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and HER1 are used interchangeably herein and refer to EGFR as disclosed for example in Carpenter et al 1987 56 881 914 including naturally occurring mutant forms thereof e.g. a deletion mutant EGFR as in Humphrey et al. 87 4207 4211 1990 . The term erbB1 refers to the gene encoding the EGFR protein product. Antibodies against HER1 are described for example in Murthy et al 1987 252 549 560 and in WO 95 25167.

The term ERRP EGF Receptor Related Protein EGFR Related Protein and epidermal growth factor receptor related protein are used interchangeably herein and refer to ERRP as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 399 743 and US Publication No. 2003 0096373.

The expressions ErbB2 and HER2 are used interchangeably herein and refer to human HER2 protein described for example in Semba et al. 82 6497 6501 1985 and Yamamoto et al. 1986 319 230 234 Genebank accession number X03363 . The term erbB2 refers to the gene encoding human ErbB2 and neu refers to the gene encoding rat p185neu. ErbB2 may be a native sequence human ErbB2.

 ErbB3 and HER3 refer to the receptor polypeptide as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 183 884 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 480 968 as well as Kraus et al. PNAS USA 86 9193 9197 1989 . Antibodies against ErbB3 are known in the art and are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 183 884 5 480 968 and in WO 97 35885.

The terms ErbB4 and HER4 herein refer to the receptor polypeptide as disclosed for example in EP Pat. Application No 599 274 Plowman et al. 90 1746 1750 1993 and Plowman et al. Nature 366 473 475 1993 including isoforms thereof e.g. as disclosed in WO 99 19488. Antibodies against HER4 are described for example in WO 02 18444.

Antibodies to ErbB receptors are available commercially from a number of sources including for example Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. California USA.

The term amino acid sequence variant refers to polypeptides having amino acid sequences that differ to some extent from a native sequence polypeptide. Ordinarily amino acid sequence variants will possess at least about 70 sequence identity with at least one receptor binding domain of a native antibody or with at least one ligand binding domain of a native receptor and preferably they will be at least about 80 more preferably at least about 90 homologous by sequence with such receptor or ligand binding domains. The amino acid sequence variants possess substitutions deletions and or insertions at certain positions within the amino acid sequence of the native amino acid sequence. Amino acids are designated by the conventional names one letter and three letter codes.

 Sequence identity is defined as the percentage of residues in the amino acid sequence variant that are identical after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Methods and computer programs for the alignment are well known in the art. One such computer program is Align 2 authored by Genentech Inc. which was filed with user documentation in the United States Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 on Dec. 10 1991.

The terms Fc receptor or FcR are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. An exemplary FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a FcR may be one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. See review M. in 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 .

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the ability of a molecule to lyse a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to a molecule e.g. an antibody complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed.

 Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150 000 daltons composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain VH followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end VL and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions FRs . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three hypervariable regions which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and with the hypervariable regions from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al 1991 Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC .

The term hypervariable region when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a complementarity determining region or CDR e.g. residues 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the light chain variable domain and 31 35 H1 50 65 H2 and 95 102 H3 in the heavy chain variable domain Kabat et al supra and or those residues from a hypervariable loop e.g. residues 26 32 L1 50 52 L2 and 91 96 L3 in the light chain variable domain and 26 32 H1 53 55 H2 and 96 101 H3 in the heavy chain variable domain Chothia and Lesk 1987 J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 917 . Framework Region or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab 2 fragment that has two antigen binding sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and antigen binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six hypervariable regions confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear at least one free thiol group. F ab 2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The light chains of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. The Fv polypeptide may further comprise a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pl ckthun in The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 . Anti ErbB2 antibody scFv fragments are described in WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a variable heavy domain VH connected to a variable light domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 6444 6448.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. rodent antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Humanization is a method to transfer the murine antigen binding information to a non immunogenic human antibody acceptor and has resulted in many therapeutically useful drugs. The method of humanization generally begins by transferring all six murine complementarity determining regions CDRs onto a human antibody framework Jones et al 1986 Nature 321 522 525 . These CDR grafted antibodies generally do not retain their original affinity for antigen binding and in fact affinity is often severely impaired. Besides the CDRs select non human antibody framework residues must also be incorporated to maintain proper CDR conformation Chothia et al 1989 Nature 342 877 . The transfer of key mouse framework residues to the human acceptor in order to support the structural conformation of the grafted CDRs has been shown to restore antigen binding and affinity Riechmann et al. 1992 J. Mol. Biol. 224 487 499 Foote and Winter 1992 J. Mol. Biol. 224 487 499 Presta et al. 1993 J. Immunol. 151 2623 2632 Werther et al. 1996 J. Immunol. Methods 157 4986 4995 and Presta et al 2001 Thromb. Haemost. 85 379 389 . For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see U.S. Pat. No. 6 407 213 Jones et al 1986 Nature 321 522 525 Riechmann et al 1988 Nature 332 323 329 and Presta 1992 Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In certain embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method or more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a gas phase protein sequencer or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

An antibody which binds a molecular target or an antigen of interest e.g. ErbB2 antigen is one capable of binding that antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful in targeting a cell expressing the antigen. Where the antibody is one which binds ErbB2 it will usually preferentially bind ErbB2 as opposed to other ErbB receptors and may be one which does not significantly cross react with other proteins such as EGFR ErbB3 or ErbB4. In such embodiments the extent of binding of the antibody to these non ErbB2 proteins e.g. cell surface binding to endogenous receptor will be less than 10 as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation RIA . Sometimes the anti ErbB2 antibody will not significantly cross react with the rat neu protein e.g. as described in Schecter et al. Nature 312 513 1984 and Drebin et al. Nature 312 545 548 1984 .

The terms treat or treatment refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures wherein the object is to prevent or slow down lessen an undesired physiological change or disorder such as the development or spread of cancer. For purposes of this invention beneficial or desired clinical results include but are not limited to alleviation of symptoms diminishment of extent of disease stabilized i.e. not worsening state of disease delay or slowing of disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state and remission whether partial or total whether detectable or undetectable. Treatment can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.

The term therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy efficacy can for example be measured by assessing the time to disease progression TTP and or determining the response rate RR .

The term bioavailability refers to the systemic availability i.e. blood plasma levels of a given amount of drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time rate and total amount extent of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.

The terms cancer and cancerous refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A tumor comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma sarcoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer lung cancer including small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer NSCLC adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer endometrial or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney or renal cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma anal carcinoma penile carcinoma as well as head and neck cancer.

An ErbB expressing cancer is one comprising cells which have ErbB protein present at their cell surface. An ErbB2 expressing cancer is one which produces sufficient levels of ErbB2 at the surface of cells thereof such that an anti ErbB2 antibody can bind thereto and have a therapeutic effect with respect to the cancer.

A cancer characterized by excessive activation of an ErbB receptor is one in which the extent of ErbB receptor activation in cancer cells significantly exceeds the level of activation of that receptor in non cancerous cells of the same tissue type. Such excessive activation may result from overexpression of the ErbB receptor and or greater than normal levels of an ErbB ligand available for activating the ErbB receptor in the cancer cells. Such excessive activation may cause and or be caused by the malignant state of a cancer cell. In some embodiments the cancer will be subjected to a diagnostic or prognostic assay to determine whether amplification and or overexpression of an ErbB receptor is occurring which results in such excessive activation of the ErbB receptor. Alternatively or additionally the cancer may be subjected to a diagnostic or prognostic assay to determine whether amplification and or overexpression an ErbB ligand is occurring in the cancer which attributes to excessive activation of the receptor. In a subset of such cancers excessive activation of the receptor may result from an autocrine stimulatory pathway.

A cancer which overexpresses an ErbB receptor is one which has significantly higher levels of an ErbB receptor such as ErbB2 at the cell surface thereof compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. ErbB receptor overexpression may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the ErbB protein present on the surface of a cell e.g. via an immunohistochemistry assay IHC . Alternatively or additionally one may measure levels of ErbB encoding nucleic acid in the cell e.g. via fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH see WO 98 45479 southern blotting or polymerase chain reaction PCR techniques such as real time quantitative PCR RT PCR . Overexpression of the ErbB ligand may be determined diagnostically by evaluating levels of the ligand or nucleic acid encoding it in the patient e.g. in a tumor biopsy or by various diagnostic assays such as the IHC FISH southern blotting PCR or in vivo assays described above. One may also study ErbB receptor overexpression by measuring shed antigen e.g. ErbB extracellular domain in a biological fluid such as serum see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 933 294 WO 91 05264 U.S. Pat. No. 5 401 638 and Sias et al. 1990 132 73 80 . Aside from the above assays various other in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated e.g. by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.

The tumors overexpressing ErbB2 HER2 are rated by immunohistochemical scores corresponding to the number of copies of HER2 molecules expressed per cell and can be determined biochemically 0 0 10 000 copies cell 1 at least about 200 000 copies cell 2 at least about 500 000 copies cell 3 about 1 2 10copies cell. Overexpression of HER2 at the 3 level which leads to ligand independent activation of the tyrosine kinase Hudziak et al. 1987 84 7159 7163 occurs in approximately 30 of breast cancers and in these patients relapse free survival and overall survival are diminished Slamon et al. 1989 244 707 712 Slamon et al. 1987 235 177 182 .

Conversely a cancer which is not characterized by overexpression of the ErbB2 receptor is one which in a diagnostic assay does not express higher than normal levels of ErbB2 receptor compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type.

The term cytotoxic agent as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes e.g. At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P C and radioactive isotopes of Lu chemotherapeutic agents and toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin including synthetic analogs and derivatives thereof.

 Phage display is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to a coat protein on the surface of phage e.g. filamentous phage particles. One utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins typically through fusions to either PIII or PVIII of filamentous phage. Wells and Lowman 3 355 362 1992 and references cited therein. In monovalent phage display a protein or peptide library is fused to a phage coat protein or a portion thereof and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type protein. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity and phagemid vectors are used which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells 3 205 0216 1991 . Phage display includes techniques for producing antibody like molecules Janeway C. Travers P. Walport M. Shlomchik 2001 5th Ed. Garland Publishing New York p 627 628 .

A phagemid is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication e.g. Co1E1 and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.

 Linker Linker Unit Linker reagent or link means a chemical moiety comprising a covalent bond or a chain of atoms that covalently attaches an antibody to a drug moiety. In various embodiments a linker is specified as L. Linkers include but are not limited to a divalent radical such as an alkyldiyl an aryldiyl a heteroaryldiyl moieties such as CR O CR repeating units of alkyloxy e.g. polyethylenoxy PEG polymethyleneoxy and alkylamino e.g. polyethyleneamino Jeffamine and diacid ester and amides including maleimide succinate succinamide diglycolate malonate and caproamide.

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomers refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. 1994 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and I or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of an ADC. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to sulfate citrate acetate trifluoroacetate oxalate chloride bromide iodide nitrate bisulfate phosphate acid phosphate isonicotinate lactate salicylate acid citrate tartrate oleate tannate pantothenate bitartrate ascorbate succinate maleate gentisinate fumarate gluconate glucuronate saccharate formate benzoate glutamate methanesulfonate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate p toluenesulfonate and pamoate i.e. 1 1 methylene bis 2 hydroxy 3 naphthoate salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion a succinate ion or other counterion. The counterion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and or one or more counterion.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable solvate refers to an association of one or more solvent molecules and an ADC. Examples of solvents that form pharmaceutically acceptable solvates include but are not limited to water isopropanol ethanol methanol DMSO ethyl acetate acetic acid and ethanolamine.

The compounds of the invention include those with potential utility for anticancer activity treatment of hyperproliferative disorders autoimmune disorders and infectious disease. In particular the compounds include an antibody conjugated i.e. covalently attached by a linker to a 1 8 bis naphthalimide drug moiety where the corresponding drug when not conjugated to an antibody has a cytotoxic or cytostatic effect. The biological activity of the drug is thus modulated by conjugation to an antibody. The antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention may selectively deliver an effective dose of a cytotoxic agent to tumor tissue whereby greater selectivity i.e. a lower efficacious dose may be achieved than upon delivery of the same dose of the 1 8 bis naphthalimide compound not conjugated to an antibody.

In one embodiment the bioavailability of the ADC of the invention or an intracellular metabolite of the ADC is improved in a mammal when compared to a 1 8 bis naphthalimide compound comprising the 1 8 bis naphthalimide moiety of the ADC. Also the bioavailability of the ADC or an intracellular metabolite of the ADC is improved in a mammal when compared to the analog of the ADC not having the 1 8 bis naphthalimide drug moiety.

In one embodiment the drug moiety of the ADC is not cleaved from the antibody until the antibody drug conjugate enters a cell with a cell surface receptor specific for the antibody of the antibody drug conjugate and the drug moiety is cleaved from the antibody when the antibody drug conjugate does enter the cell. The 1 8 bis naphthalimide drug moiety may be intracellularly cleaved in a mammal from the antibody of the compound or an intracellular metabolite of the compound by enzymatic action hydrolysis oxidation or other mechanism.

An antibody drug conjugate compound comprises an antibody covalently attached by a linker to one or more 1 8 bis naphthalimide drug moieties the compound having Formula I Ab L D I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof wherein

The drug loading is represented by p the average number of drugs per antibody in a molecule of Formula I. Drug loading may range from 1 to 20 drugs D per antibody Ab or mAb . Compositions of ADC of Formula I include collections of antibodies conjugated with a range of drugs from 1 to 20. The average number of drugs per antibody in preparations of ADC from conjugation reactions may be characterized by conventional means such as mass spectroscopy ELISA assay and HPLC. The quantitative distribution of ADC in terms of p may also be determined. In some instances separation purification and characterization of homogeneous ADC where p is a certain value from ADC with other drug loadings may be achieved by means such as reverse phase HPLC or electrophoresis.

For some antibody drug conjugates p may be limited by the number of attachment sites on the antibody. For example where the attachment is a cysteine thiol as in the exemplary embodiments above an antibody may have only one or several cysteine thiol groups or may have only one or several sufficiently reactive thiol groups through which a linker may be attached. Higher drug loading e.g. p 5 may cause aggregation insolubility toxicity or loss of cellular permeability of certain antibody drug conjugates.

Typically fewer than the theoretical maximum of drug moieties are conjugated to an antibody during a conjugation reaction. An antibody may contain for example many lysine residues that do not react with the drug linker intermediate or linker reagent. Only the most reactive lysine groups may react with an amine reactive linker reagent. Also only the most reactive cysteine thiol groups may react with a thiol reactive linker reagent. Generally antibodies do not contain many if any free and reactive cysteine thiol groups which may be linked to a drug moiety. Most cysteine thiol residues in the antibodies of the compounds of the invention exist as disulfide bridges and must be reduced with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT under partial or total reducing conditions. Additionally the antibody must be subjected to denaturing conditions to reveal reactive nucleophilic groups such as lysine or cysteine. The loading drug antibody ratio of an ADC may be controlled in several different manners including i limiting the molar excess of drug linker intermediate or linker reagent relative to antibody ii limiting the conjugation reaction time or temperature and iii partial or limiting reductive conditions for cysteine thiol modification.

It is to be understood that where more than one nucleophilic group reacts with a drug linker intermediate or linker reagent followed by drug moiety reagent then the resulting product is a mixture of ADC compounds with a distribution of one or more drug moieties attached to an antibody. The average number of drugs per antibody may be calculated from the mixture by dual ELISA antibody assay specific for antibody and specific for the drug. Individual ADC molecules may be identified in the mixture by mass spectroscopy and separated by HPLC e.g. hydrophobic interaction chromatography Effect of drug loading on the pharmacology pharmacokinetics and toxicity of an anti CD30 antibody drug conjugate Hamblett K. J. et al Abstract No. 624 American Association for Cancer Research 2004 Annual Meeting Mar. 27 31 2004 Proceedings of the AACR Volume 45 March 2004 Controlling the Location of Drug Attachment in Antibody Drug Conjugates Alley S. C. et al Abstract No. 627 American Association for Cancer Research 2004 Annual Meeting Mar. 27 31 2004 Proceedings of the AACR Volume 45 March 2004 . Thus a homogeneous ADC with a single loading value may be isolated from the conjugation mixture by electrophoresis or chromatography.

Drug moieties D are the 1 8 bis naphthalimide type and have Formulas IIa and IIb. For descriptive purposes herein each of the 1 8 naphthalimide aromatic carbon atoms are numbered according to the structure 

The 1 8 naphthalimide aromatic carbon atoms may be independently substituted with a range of substituents X X besides H at the 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 positions at each of the 1 8 naphthalimide groups. One embodiment of a bis 1 8 naphthalimide drug moiety is the unsubstituted bis 1 8 naphthalimide elinafide drug moiety E having the structure

The bis amino alkyl group that attaches the two 1 8 naphthalimide groups may bear a range of substituents besides H on the carbon atoms R and the nitrogen atom not linked to L R . Exemplary embodiments of D where Y is N R m is 3 and n is 2 in the bis amino alkyl group include the D moiety IIa structures 

The three alkylene groups of the bis amino alkyl group that attaches the two 1 8 naphthalimide groups may independently be of different lengths and bear a range of substituents besides H on the carbon atoms R and the nitrogen atom Y NR not linked to L R . The two non equivalent alkylene groups between each 1 8 naphthalimide group and a nitrogen atom n are independently 1 2 or 3 carbons in length. The alkylene group between the nitrogen atoms m is 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 carbons in length. The compounds of the invention thus include all 54 possible combinations of lengths of the three alkylene groups in a drug moiety D IIa and IIb Y NR .

Bis 1 8 naphthalimide drug moieties were prepared according to Brana et al 2004 J. Med. Chem. 47 1391 1399 Brana et al 2003 Org. Biomol. Chem. 1 648 654 Brana M. F. and Ramos A. 2001 Current Med. Chem. Anti Cancer Agents 1 237 255 as well as conventional organic chemistry methodology.

Generally 1 8 naphthalimide intermediates may be prepared from 1 8 naphthalic anhydride compounds Chem. Rev. 1970 70 439 469 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 146 720 5 616 589 5 416 089 5 585 382 5 552 544 . Various substituted 1 8 naphthalic anhydride compounds are commercially available such as 4 Bromo 1 8 naphthalic anhydride Aldrich Milwaukee Wis. . Reaction of a 1 8 naphthalic anhydride compound with a primary amine gives the 1 8 naphthalimide U.S. Pat. No. 5 329 048 . Displacement of bromine from the 4 position occurs with various nucleophilic reagents.

Where the amine reagent is a bis amino compound two 1 8 naphthalic anhydride react to form bis 1 8 naphthalimide intermediates Brana M. F. and Ramos A. 2001 Current Med. Chem. Anti Cancer Agents 1 237 255 Brana et al 1993 Anticancer Drug Des. 8 257 Brana et al 1996 Anticancer Drug Des. 11 297 WO 94 02466 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 874 863 5 206 249 5 329 048 5 416 089 5 488 110 5 981 753 6 177 570 . For example two equivalents of an anhydride in toluene are treated with one equivalent of the corresponding polyamine in ethanol. The mixture is heated at reflux until the reaction is complete. The bis 1 8 naphthalimide is isolated e.g. by filtration and crystallization as the free base and converted to a salt such as the mesylate methanesulfonate with methanesulfonic acid or as the trifluoroacetate with trifluoroacetic acid TFA and washed with an organic solvent according to the method of Brana et al 2004 J. Med. Chem. 47 1391 1399.

Alternatively the 1 8 naphthalimide groups may be attached to the polyamine unit sequentially WO 94 02466 by protecting one of the terminal amino groups of the polyamine reagent during reaction with the first 1 8 naphthalic anhydride reagent. After deprotection of the terminal amino group of the mono 1 8 naphthalimide intermediate a second 1 8 naphthalic anhydride reagent may be reacted to form the bis 1 8 naphthalimide product. By this route asymmetric bis 1 8 naphthalimide compounds can be prepared i.e. where Xand Xare different than Xand X. Suitable amino protecting groups include mesitylenesulfonyl dinitrobenzenesulfonyl BOC tert butyloxycarbonyl CBz carbobenzoxy or those detailed in Theodora W. Greene 1991 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York or later editions thereto. Alternatively the terminal amino group for coupling to the second 1 8 naphthalic anhydride reagent may be generated by reductive amination of a carbonyl group such as aldehyde or ester or by reduction of a nitrile group.

The linker L is a bifunctional or multifunctional moiety which is covalently attached to one or more Drug moieties D and an antibody unit Ab to form Antibody Drug Conjugates ADC of the invention.

The linker may be a dendritic type linker for covalent attachment of more than one drug moiety through a branching multifunctional linker moiety to an antibody Sun et al 2002 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12 2213 2215 Sun et al 2003 Bioorganic Medicinal Chemistry 11 1761 1768 . Dendritic linkers can increase the molar ratio of drug to antibody i.e. loading which is related to the potency of the ADC. Thus where an antibody bears only one reactive group e.g. a lysine amino or a cysteine thiol a multitude of drug moieties may be attached through a dendritic linker.

The following exemplary embodiments of dendritic linker reagents allow up to nine nucleophilic drug moiety reagents to be conjugated by reaction with the chloroethyl nitrogen mustard functional groups 

The Stretcher unit A when present is capable of linking an antibody Ab to an amino acid unit W . In this regard an antibody Ab has a functional group that can form a bond with a functional group of a Stretcher. Useful functional groups that can be present on an antibody either naturally or via chemical manipulation include but are not limited to sulfhydryl SH amino hydroxyl carboxy the anomeric hydroxyl group of a carbohydrate and carboxyl. In one aspect the reactive functional groups on the antibody are sulfhydryl and amino. Sulfhydryl groups can be generated by reduction of an intramolecular cysteine disulfide bond of an antibody. Alternatively sulfhydryl groups can be generated by reaction of an amino group of a lysine moiety of an antibody using 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent or another sulfhydryl generating reagent.

Each carbon atom to which R R R Ror Ris attached independently in the S or R configuration or a racemic mixture. Amino acid units may thus be enantiomerically pure racemic or diastereomeric.

The Spacer unit SP when present i links an Amino Acid unit to the Drug unit when an Amino Acid unit is present ii links the Stretcher unit to the Drug moiety when the Amino Acid unit is absent or iii links the Drug moiety to the antibody unit when both the Amino Acid unit and Stretcher unit are absent. Spacer units are of two general types self immolative and non self immolative. A non self immolative Spacer unit is one in which part or all of the Spacer unit remains bound to the Drug moiety after cleavage particularly enzymatic of an Amino Acid unit from the Drug Linker antibody Conjugate or the Drug Linker Compound. Examples of a non self immolative Spacer unit include but are not limited to a glycine glycine Spacer unit and a glycine Spacer unit. When an Exemplary Compound containing a glycine glycine Spacer unit or a glycine Spacer unit undergoes enzymatic cleavage via a tumor cell associated protease a cancer cell associated protease or a lymphocyte associated protease a glycine glycine Drug moiety or a glycine Drug moiety is cleaved from Ab A Ww .

Other examples of self immolative spacers include but are not limited to aromatic compounds that are electronically similar to the PAB group such as 2 aminoimidazol 5 methanol derivatives Hay et al. 1999 Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 9 2237 and ortho or para aminobenzylacetals. Self immolative spacers also include where the PAB group is substituted by a heterocyclic group WO 2005 082023 .

Intermediates or reagents which include a bis 1 8 naphthalimide drug moiety and a reactive Bis 1 8 naphthalimide linker reagents bear functionality which is reactive with an antibody so as to allow covalent attachment i.e. conjugation of the reagent to the antibody to prepare an antibody drug conjugate ADC of the invention.

Another exemplary bis 1 8 naphthalimide drug linker reagent is MC vc PAB N N bis aminoethyl 1 3 propanediamine bis 4 N imidazolyl 1 8 naphthalimide 111a 

The antibody unit Ab includes within its scope any unit of an antibody Ab that binds or reactively associates or complexes with a receptor antigen or other receptive moiety associated with a given target cell population. An antibody can be any protein or protein like molecule that binds to complexes with or reacts with a moiety of a cell population sought to be therapeutically or otherwise biologically modified. In one aspect the antibody unit acts to deliver the Drug unit to the particular target cell population with which the antibody unit reacts. Such antibodies include but are not limited to large molecular weight proteins such as for example full length antibodies antibody fragments.

An antibody unit can form a bond to either a linker a Stretcher unit an Amino Acid unit a Spacer Unit or a Drug moiety directly. An antibody unit can form a bond to a Linker unit via a heteroatom of the antibody. The linking heteroatoms of the antibody may be a reactive nucleophilic group on any amino acid side chain such as a cysteine thiol a lysine amine an aspartic acid or glutamic acid carboxyl a serine threonine or tyrosine hydroxyl or an arginine. Heteroatoms that may be present on an antibody unit include sulfur in one embodiment from a sulfhydryl group of an antibody such as a cysteine thiol oxygen in one embodiment from a carbonyl carboxyl or hydroxyl group of an antibody and nitrogen in one embodiment from a primary or secondary amino group of an antibody . These heteroatoms can be present on the antibody in the antibody s natural state for example a naturally occurring antibody or can be introduced into the antibody via chemical modification.

In another embodiment the antibody has one or more lysine residues that can be chemically modified to introduce one or more sulfhydryl groups. The antibody unit then may bond to a linker reagent or drug linker moiety via the sulfhydryl group s sulfur atom. The reagents that can be used to modify lysines include but are not limited to N succinimidyl S acetylthioacetate SATA and 2 Iminothiolane hydrochloride Traut s Reagent .

In another embodiment the antibody can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be chemically modified to have one or more sulfhydryl groups. The antibody unit bonds to the linker reagent or drug linker moiety such as the Stretcher Unit via the sulfhydryl group s sulfur atom.

In yet another embodiment the antibody can have one or more carbohydrate groups that can be oxidized to provide an aldehyde CHO group suitable for conjugation with a linker reagent or drug linker moiety see for e.g. Laguzza et al. 1989 32 3 548 55 . Suitable oxidizing reagents include periodate reagents. The corresponding aldehyde can form a bond with a Reactive Site on a Stretcher. The reaction may proceed through a Schiff s base intermediate and undergo subsequent reduction to a stable amine linkage. Reactive sites on a Stretcher that can react with a carbonyl group on an antibody include but are not limited to hydrazine and hydroxylamine. Other protocols for the modification of proteins for the attachment or association of Drug Units are described in Coligan et al. vol. 2 John Wiley Sons 2002 incorporated herein by reference.

In yet another embodiment a tyrosine residue of the antibody may undergo diazotization by electrophilici aromatic substitution to form a diazo linkage with a linker reagent or drug linker moiety.

In attempts to discover effective cellular targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy researchers have sought to identify transmembrane or otherwise tumor associated polypeptides that are specifically expressed on the surface of one or more particular type s of cancer cell as compared to on one or more normal non cancerous cell s . Often such tumor associated polypeptides are more abundantly expressed on the surface of the cancer cells as compared to on the surface of the non cancerous cells. The identification of such tumor associated cell surface antigen polypeptides has given rise to the ability to specifically target cancer cells for destruction via antibody based therapies.

Antibodies which comprise Ab in Formula I antibody drug conjugates ADC and which may be useful in the treatment of cancer include but are not limited to antibodies against tumor associated antigens TAA . Such tumor associated antigens are known in the art and can prepared for use in generating antibodies using methods and information which are well known in the art. Examples of TAA include 1 35 but are not limited to TAA 1 36 listed below. For convenience information relating to these antigens all of which are known in the art is listed below and includes names alternative names Genbank accession numbers and primary reference s . Tumor associated antigens targeted by antibodies include all amino acid sequence variants and isoforms possessing at least about 70 80 85 90 or 95 sequence identity relative to the sequences identified in the cited references or which exhibit substantially the same biological properties or characteristics as a TAA having a sequence found in the cited references. For example a TAA having a variant sequence generally is able to bind specifically to an antibody that binds specifically to the TAA with the corresponding sequence listed. The sequences and disclosure specifically recited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.

For other tumor associated antigens and specific antibodies thereto see also WO04 045516 3 Jun. 2004 WO03 000113 3 Jan. 2003 WO02 016429 28 Feb. 2002 WO02 16581 28 Feb. 2002 WO03 024392 27 Mar. 2003 WO04 016225 26 Feb. 2004 WO01 40309 7 Jun. 2001 US 20050238650 A1 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Antibodies of the invention can be produced using any method known in the art to be useful for the synthesis of antibodies in particular by chemical synthesis or by recombinant expression techniques.

Recombinant expression of antibodies or fragment derivative or analog thereof may be conducted by assembling a nucleic acid encoding the antibody if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. 1994 BioTechniques 17 242 . This method involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligation of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Alternatively a nucleic acid molecule encoding an antibody can be generated from a suitable source. If a clone containing the nucleic acid encoding the particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody is known a nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or cDNA library generated from any tissue or cells expressing the immunoglobulin by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence.

If an antibody that specifically recognizes a particular antigen is not commercially available or a source for a cDNA library for cloning a nucleic acid encoding such an immunoglobulin antibodies specific for a particular antigen can be generated by any method known in the art for example by immunizing a patient such as a rabbit to generate polyclonal antibodies or by generating monoclonal antibodies e.g. as described by Kohler and Milstein 1975 Nature 256 495 497 or as described by Kozbor et al. 1983 Immunology Today 4 72 or Cole et al. 1985 in Alan R. Liss Inc. pp. 77 96 . Alternatively a clone encoding at least the Fab portion of the antibody can be obtained by screening Fab expression libraries e.g. as described in Huse et al. 1989 Science 246 1275 1281 for clones of Fab fragments that bind the specific antigen or by screening antibody libraries See e.g. Clackson et al. 1991 Nature 352 624 Hane et al. 1997 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 4937 .

Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least the variable domain of the antibody is obtained it can be introduced into a vector containing the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant regions of the antibody see e.g. WO 86 05807 WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 . Vectors containing the complete light or heavy chain that allow for the expression of a complete antibody molecule are available. Then the nucleic acid encoding the antibody can be used to introduce the nucleotide substitutions or deletion necessary to substitute or delete the one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond with an amino acid residue that does not contain a sulfhydyl group. Such modifications can be carried out by any method known in the art for the introduction of specific mutations or deletions in a nucleotide sequence for example but not limited to chemical mutagenesis and in vitro site directed mutagenesis Hutchinson et al. 1978 253 6551 .

In addition techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies Morrison et al. 1984 81 851 855 Neuberger et al. 1984 312 604 608 Takeda et al. 1985 314 452 454 by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a human immunoglobulin constant region e.g. humanized antibodies.

Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 694 778 Bird 1988 Science 242 423 42 Huston et al. 1988 85 5879 5883 and Ward et al. 1989 334 544 54 can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used Skerra et al. 1988 242 1038 1041 .

Antibody fragments that recognize specific epitopes can be generated by known techniques. For example such fragments include but are not limited to the F ab 2 fragments that can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the Fab fragments that can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the F ab 2 fragments.

Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding an antibody has been obtained the vector for the production of the antibody can be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods that are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. See for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 2Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 John Wiley Sons NY .

Polyclonal antibodies may be raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized e.g. keyhole limpet hemocyanin serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent for example maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester conjugation through cysteine residues N hydroxysuccinimide through lysine residues glutaraldehyde succinic anhydride SOCl or RN C NR where R and Rare different alkyl groups.

Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies. For example the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al. 5 256 262 1993 and Pl ckthun 130 151 188 1992 .

Monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al 1990 Nature 348 552 554 Clackson et al 1991 Nature 352 624 628 and Marks et al 1991 J. Mol. Biol. 222 581 597. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity nm range human antibodies by chain shuffling Marks et al 1992 Bio Technology 10 779 783 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al 1993 Nuc. Acids. Res. 21 2265 2266 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.

The DNA also may be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy chain and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al 1984 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 81 6851 or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide.

Humanization can be performed by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody Jones et al 1986 Nature 321 522 525 Riechmann et al 1988 Nature 332 323 327 Verhoeyen et al 1988 Science 239 1534 1536 . Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies Sims et al 1993 J. Immunol. 151 2296 Chothia et al 1987 J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 Carter et al 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 4285 Presta et al. 1993 J. Immunol. 151 2623 .

Various forms of the humanized antibody are contemplated. For example the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment such as a Fab. Alternatively the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody such as an intact IgG1 antibody. The murine monoclonal antibody 4D5 which specifically binds the extracellular domain of ErbB2 is produced as described in Fendly et al 1990 Cancer Research 50 1550 1558 from NIH 3T3 HER2 3cells expressing approximately 1 10ErbB2 molecules cell as described in Hudziak et al 1987 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 7158 7163 and harvested with phosphate buffered saline PBS containing 25 mM EDTA and used to immunize BALB c mice. Hybridoma supernatants were screened for ErbB2 binding by ELISA and radioimmunoprecipitation.

As an alternative to humanization human antibodies can be generated Jakobovits et al 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 2551 Jakobovits et al 1993 Nature 362 255 258 Bruggermann et al 1993 Year in Immuno. 7 33 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 591 669 U.S. Pat. No. 5 589 369 U.S. Pat. No. 5 545 807 .

Alternatively phage display technology McCafferty et al. 1990 Nature 348 552 553 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors Johnson Kevin S. and Chiswell David J. 1993 Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3 564 571 Clackson et al 1991 Nature 352 624 628 . Human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. No. 5 567 610 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 229 275 . Human anti ErbB2 antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 772 997 and WO 97 00271.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments Morimoto et al 1992 Journal of Biochem. and Biophys. Methods 24 107 117 and Brennan et al 1985 Science 229 81 Carter et al 1992 Bio Technology 10 163 167 WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 894 U.S. Pat. No. 5 587 458 U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 .

Amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody expressing nucleic acid or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post translational processes of the antibody such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of an antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis Cunningham and Wells 1989 Science 244 1081 1085. Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an N terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

Peptide sequences which specifically bind to albumin may be fused or conjugated to the antibody which comprises the antibody drug conjugates ADC . Plasma protein binding can be an effective means of improving the pharmacokinetic properties of short lived molecules such as antibodies or ADC. Serum albumin binding peptides ABP can alter the pharmacodynamics of fused active domain proteins including alteration of tissue uptake clearance penetration and diffusion and increase serum half life. These pharmacodynamic parameters can be modulated by specific selection of the appropriate serum albumin binding peptide sequence US 20040001827 at 0076 . A series of albumin binding peptides were identified by phage display screening Dennis et al. 2002 J Biol Chem. 277 35035 35043 at Tables III and IV page 35038 WO 01 45746 and WO 01 45746 at pages 12 13 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated.

Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.

Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted generally with serine to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely cysteine bond s may be added to the antibody to improve its stability particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment .

It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance antigen dependent cell mediated cyotoxicity ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al J. Exp Med. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. J. Immunol. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. Cancer Research 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. Anti Cancer Drug Design 3 219 230 1989 .

To increase the serum half life of the antibody one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 739 277 for example. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG IgG IgG or IgG that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule.

The Antibody Drug Conjugates ADC of the Invention can be made using the synthetic procedures outlined below. ADC can be conveniently prepared using a Linker having a reactive site for binding to the Drug and Antibody. In one aspect a Linker has a reactive site which has an electrophilic group that is reactive to a nucleophilic group present on an antibody. Useful nucleophilic groups on an antibody include but are not limited to sulfhydryl hydroxyl and amino groups. The heteroatom of the nucleophilic group of an antibody is reactive to an electrophilic group on a Linker and forms a covalent bond to a Linker unit. Useful electrophilic groups include but are not limited to maleimide and haloacetamide groups. The electrophilic group provides a convenient site for Antibody attachment.

In another embodiment a Linker has a reactive site which has a nucleophilic group that is reactive to an electrophilic group present on an antibody. Useful electrophilic groups on an antibody include but are not limited to aldehyde and ketone carbonyl groups. The heteroatom of a nucleophilic group of a Linker can react with an electrophilic group on an antibody and form a covalent bond to an antibody unit. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Linker include but are not limited to hydrazide oxime amino hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide. The electrophilic group on an antibody provides a convenient site for attachment to a Linker.

Carboxylic acid functional groups and chloroformate functional groups are also useful reactive sites for a Linker because they can react with secondary amino groups of a Drug to form an amide linkage. Also useful as a reactive site is a carbonate functional group on a Linker such as but not limited to p nitrophenyl carbonate which can react with an amino group of a Drug such as but not limited to N methyl valine to form a carbamate linkage. Typically peptide based Drugs can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schr der and K. L bke The Peptides volume 1 pp 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry.

As described in more detail below the ADC of the Invention are conveniently prepared using a Linker having two or more reactive functional groups for binding to the Drug and Antibody. In one aspect of the invention a Linker has an electrophilic group that is reactive with a nucleophilic group present on an antibody. Useful nucleophilic groups on a Antibody include but are not limited to sulfhydryl hydroxyl and amino groups. The heteroatom of the nucleophilic group of an antibody is reactive to an electrophilic group on a Linker and forms a covalent bond to a Linker unit.

Linker intermediates may be assembled with any combination or sequence of reactions including Spacer Stretcher and Amino Acid units. The Spacer Stretcher and Amino Acid units may employ reactive functional groups which are electrophilic nucleophilic free radical in nature. Reactive functional groups include but are not limited to 

where X is a leaving group e.g. O mesyl O tosyl Cl Br I an alkyldisulfide or aryldisulfide RSS or a maleimide group.

In another embodiment the Linker may be substituted with groups which modulated solubility or reactivity. For example a sulfonate substituent may increase water solubility of the reagent and facilitate the coupling reaction of the linker reagent with the antibody or the drug moiety or facilitate the coupling reaction of Ab L with D or D L with Ab depending on the synthetic route employed to prepare the ADC.

Rockford Ill. 61105 U.S.A. See pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

Useful Linkers can also be obtained from other commercial sources such as Molecular Biosciences Inc. Boulder Colo. or synthesized in accordance with procedures described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 214 345 to Firestone et al 1995 60 5352 5 Frisch et al. 1996 7 180 186.

Useful Stretchers may be incorporated into a Linker using the commercially available intermediates from Molecular Biosciences Boulder Colo. described below by utilizing known techniques of organic synthesis.

Stretchers of formula IIIa can be introduced into a Linker by reacting the following intermediates with the N terminus of an Amino Acid unit

Stretcher units of formula Va can be introduced into a Linker by reacting the following intermediates with the N terminus of an Amino Acid unit 

Other useful Stretchers may be synthesized according to known procedures.

S. et al. 2000 41 10 1531 1533 and Gilon C. et al. 1967 23 11 4441 4447 wherein R is selected from C Calkylene C Ccarbocyclo O C Calkyl arylene C Calkylene arylene arylene C Calkylene C Calkylene C Ccarbocyclo C Ccarbocyclo C Calkylene C Cheterocyclo C Calkylene C Cheterocyclo C Cheterocyclo C Calkylene CHCHO CHCHO CH and r is an integer ranging from 1 10. Isothiocyanate Stretchers S C N R C O may be prepared from isothiocyanatocarboxylic acid chlorides as described in 1975 87 14 517.

General Procedure G Amide formation using HATU. A Drug Ib 1.0 eq. and an N protected Linker containing a carboxylic acid group 1.0 eq. are diluted with a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane and the resulting solution is treated with HATU 1.5 eq. and an organic base such as pyridine 1.5 eq. . The reaction mixture is allowed to stir under an inert atmosphere such as argon for 6 h during which time the reaction mixture is monitored using HPLC. The reaction mixture is concentrated and the resulting residue is purified using HPLC to yield the amide of formula AK.

General Procedure H Carbamate formation using HOBt. A mixture of a Linker AL having a p nitrophenyl carbonate 1.1 eq. and Drug Ib 1.0 eq. are diluted with an aprotic organic solvent such as DMF to provide a solution having a concentration of 50 100 mM and the resulting solution is treated with HOBt 2.0 eq. and placed under an inert atmosphere such as argon. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir for 15 min then an organic base such as pyridine 1 4 v v is added and the reaction progress is monitored using HPLC. The Linker is typically consumed within 16 h. The reaction mixture is then concentrated in vacuo and the resulting residue is purified using for example HPLC to yield the carbamate AM.

An alternate method of preparing Drug Linker Compounds is outlined in where a drug moiety D is reacted with a Linker reagent which does not have a Stretcher unit attached. This provides intermediate AP which has an Amino Acid unit having an Fmoc protected N terminus. The Fmoc group is then removed and the resulting amine intermediate AQ is then attached to a Stretcher unit via a coupling reaction catalyzed using PyBrop or DEPC. The construction of Drug Linker Compounds containing either a bromoacetamide Stretcher AR or a PEG maleimide Stretcher AS is illustrated in where Q is C Calkyl O C Calkyl halogen nitro or cyano and m is an integer ranging from 0 4.

One exemplary method of preparing an antibody for conjugation with a bis 1 8 naphthalimide drug moiety of the invention entails treating the antibody with a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol DTT to reduce some or all of the cysteine disulfide residues to form highly nucleophilic cysteine thiol groups CHSH . The partially reduced antibody thus reacts with bis 1 8 naphthalimide drug linker compounds or linker reagents with electrophilic functional groups such as maleimide or halo carbonyl according to the conjugation method at page 766 of Klussman et al 2004 Bioconjugate Chemistry 15 4 765 773.

For example an antibody e.g. trastuzumab dissolved in 500 mM sodium borate and 500 mM sodium chloride at pH 8.0 is treated with an excess of 100 mM dithiothreitol DTT . After incubation at 37 C. for about 30 minutes the buffer is exchanged by elution over Sephadex G25 resin and eluted with PBS with 1 mM DTPA. The thiol Ab value is checked by determining the reduced antibody concentration from the absorbance at 280 nm of the solution and the thiol concentration by reaction with DTNB Aldrich Milwaukee Wis. and determination of the absorbance at 412 nm. The reduced antibody dissolved in PBS is chilled on ice. The drug linker e.g. MC val cit PAB bis 1 8 naphthalimide in DMSO dissolved in acetonitrile and water at known concentration is added to the chilled reduced antibody in PBS. After about one hour an excess of maleimide is added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture is concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and the ADC e.g. trastuzumab MC vc PAB bis 1 8 naphthalimide is purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS filtered through 0.2 m filters under sterile conditions and frozen for storage.

Exemplary embodiments of compounds of the invention where at least one of Y is O or S include the following structures 

Compounds listed in Table 2 were prepared characterized and assayed for their in vitro activity against tumor cells. It was found generally that the heterocyclic substituted 1 8 bis naphthalimide compounds in Table 2 had dramatically improved solubility e.g. greater than 1 mg ml in neutral aqueous solutions relative to analogs with hydrogen at the 1 8 positions or other non heterocyclic substituents e.g. nitro halo or alkoxy e.g. less than 0.1 mg ml.

Bis 1 8 naphthalimide compounds were prepared according to Brana et al 2004 J. Med. Chem. 47 1391 1399 Brana et al 2003 Org. Biomol. Chem. 1 648 654 Brana M. F. and Ramos A. 2001 Current Med. Chem. Anti Cancer Agents 1 237 255 as well as conventional organic chemistry methodology.

Generally 1 8 naphthalimide intermediates may be prepared from 1 8 naphthalic anhydride compounds Chem. Rev. 1970 70 439 469 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 146 720 5 616 589 5 416 089 5 585 382 5 552 544 . Various substituted 1 8 naphthalic anhydride compounds are commercially available such as 4 Bromo 1 8 naphthalic anhydride Aldrich Milwaukee Wis. . Reaction of a 1 8 naphthalic anhydride compound with a primary amine gives the 1 8 naphthalimide. Displacement of bromine from the 4 position occurs with various nucleophilic reagents.

Where the amine reagent is a bis amino compound two 1 8 naphthalic anhydride molecules react with an amine to form bis 1 8 naphthalimide intermediates Brana M. F. and Ramos A. 2001 Current Med. Chem. Anti Cancer Agents 1 237 255 Brana et al 1993 Anticancer Drug Des. 8 257 Brana et al 1996 Anticancer Drug Des. 11 297 WO 94 02466 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 874 863 5 206 249 5 416 089 5 488 110 5 981 753 6 177 570 . For example two equivalents of an anhydride in toluene are treated with one equivalent of the corresponding polyamine in ethanol. The mixture is heated at reflux until the reaction is complete. The bis 1 8 naphthalimide is isolated e.g. by filtration and crystallization as the free base and converted to a salt such as the mesylate with methanesulfonic acid or as the trifluoroacetate with trifluoroacetic acid TFA and washed with an organic solvent according to the method of Brana et al 2004 J. Med. Chem. 47 1391 1399.

Alternatively the 1 8 naphthalimide groups may be attached to the polyamine unit sequentially WO 94 02466 by protecting one of the terminal amino groups of the polyamine reagent during reaction with the first 1 8 naphthalic anhydride reagent. After deprotection of the terminal amino group of the mono 1 8 naphthalimide intermediate a second 1 8 naphthalic anhydride reagent may be reacted to form the bis 1 8 naphthalimide product. By this route asymmetric bis 1 8 naphthalimide compounds can be prepared i.e. where Xand Xare different than Xand X. Suitable amino protecting groups include mesitylenesulfonyl dinitrobenzenesulfonyl BOC tert butyloxycarbonyl CBz carbobenzoxy or those detailed in Theodora W. Greene 1991 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York or later editions thereto. Alternatively the terminal amino group for coupling to the second 1 8 naphthalic anhydride reagent may be generated by reductive amination of a carbonyl group such as aldehyde or ester or by reduction of a nitrile group.

Generally the cytotoxic or cytostatic activity of a compound of the invention is measured by exposing mammalian cells having receptor proteins e.g. HER2 to the antibody of the ADC in a cell culture medium culturing the cells for a period from about 6 hours to about 5 days and measuring cell viability. Cell based in vitro assays were used to measure viability proliferation cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis caspase activation of the ADC of the invention.

The in vitro potency of antibody drug conjugates was measured by a cell proliferation assay . The CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay is a commercially available Promega Corp. Madison Wis. homogeneous assay method based on the recombinant expression of luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 5 583 024 U.S. Pat. No. 5 674 713 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 700 670 . This cell proliferation assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present an indicator of metabolically active cells Crouch et al 1993 J. Immunol. Meth. 160 81 88 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 677 . The CellTiter Glo Assay was conducted in 96 well format making it amenable to automated high throughput screening HTS Cree et al 1995 AntiCancer Drugs 6 398 404 . The homogeneous assay procedure involves adding the single reagent CellTiter Glo Reagent directly to cells cultured in serum supplemented medium. Cell washing removal of medium and multiple pipetting steps are not required. The system detects as few as 15 cells well in a 384 well format in 10 minutes after adding reagent and mixing. The cells may be treated continuously with ADC or they may be treated and separated from ADC. Generally cells treated briefly i.e. 3 hours showed the same potency effects as continuously treated cells.

The homogeneous add mix measure format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The amount of ATP is directly proportional to the number of cells present in culture. The CellTiter Glo Assay generates a glow type luminescent signal produced by the luciferase reaction which has a half life generally greater than five hours depending on cell type and medium used. Viable cells are reflected in relative luminescence units RLU . The substrate Beetle Luciferin is oxidatively decarboxylated by recombinant firefly luciferase with concomitant conversion of ATP to AMP and generation of photons. The extended half life eliminates the need to use reagent injectors and provides flexibility for continuous or batch mode processing of multiple plates. This cell proliferation assay can be used with various multiwell formats e.g. 96 or 384 well format. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is presented as relative light units RLU measured over time.

The anti proliferative effects of antibody drug conjugates were measured by the cell proliferation in vitro cell killing assay above against two breast tumor cell lines .

The antibody drug conjugates of Table 3 were prepared and tested. ICvalues of the ADC were established for invitro cell killing potency against SK BR 3 and BT 474 Table 3 which are known to over express HER2 receptor protein.

Antibody drug conjugates of Formula I were prepared where Ab included anti EphB2R and anti CD22 antibodies. These conjugates also showed in vitro cytotoxic or cytostatic activity.

Heterocyclic substituted bis 1 8 naphthalimide compounds of Formula XV in Table 2 were prepared and tested for in vitro activity against a panel of tumor cells Example 110 . The IC g ADC ml activities ranged from about 1 nM to about 100 M or no significant activity in BT474 H460 HCT116 HUVEC LNCAP MCF7 and PC3 cells. The average log and linear IC50 nM of some of the compounds across the 7 tumor cell panel is shown in Table 4.

Serum clearance and stability of ADC may be investigated in nude naive without tumors received by exogenous grafts mice. A difference in the amount of total antibody and ADC indicates cleavage of the linker and separation of the antibody from its drug moiety.

Efficacy of the antibody drug conjugates of the invention was measured in vivo by implanting allografts or xenografts of cancer cells in rodents and treating the tumors with ADC. Variable results are to be expected depending on the cell line the specificity of antibody binding of the ADC to receptors present on the cancer cells dosing regimen and other factors. For example the in vivo efficacy of anti HER2 ADC was measured by a high expressing HER2 transgenic explant mouse model. An allograft may be propagated from the Fo5 MMTV transgenic mouse which does not respond to or responds poorly to HERCEPTIN therapy. Subjects were treated once with ADC and monitored over 3 6 weeks to measure the time to tumor doubling log cell kill and tumor shrinkage. The ADC of the invention showed only modest efficacy in slowing the progression of tumor growth. For example an IV administration of 10 mg H MC af PAB bis 4 imidazolyl E 203 per kg animal showed only a slight increase in the time for mean MMTV HER2 Fo5 tumor volume doubling in athymic nude mice relative to control injection vehicle PBS buffer . Follow up dose response and multi dose experiments may be conducted.

Antibody drug conjugates and an ADC minus control Vehicle may be evaluated in an acute toxicity rat model Brown et al 2002 Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 50 333 340 . Toxicity of ADC may be investigated by treatment of rats with the ADC and subsequent inspection and analysis of the effects on various organs. Based on gross observations body weights clinical pathology parameters serum chemistry and hematology and histopathology the toxicity of ADC may be observed characterized and measured. Clinical chemistry serum enzymes and hematology analysis may also be conducted periodically concluding with complete necropsy with histopathological assessment. Toxicity signals included the clinical observation of weight loss considering that weight loss or weight change relative to animals dosed only with Vehicle in animals after dosing with ADC is a gross and general indicator of systemic or localized toxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be measured by i elevated liver enzymes such as AST aspartate aminotransferase ALT alanine aminotransferase GGT g glutamyl transferase ii increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures and iii hepatocyte necrosis. Hematolymphoid toxicity is observed by depletion of leukocytes primarily granuloctyes neutrophils and or platelets and lymphoid organ involvement i.e. atrophy or apoptotic activity. Toxicity is also noted by gastrointestinal tract lesions such as increased numbers of mitotic and apoptotic figures and degenerative entercolitis.

Administration of bis 1 8 naphthalimide Drug Compounds Antibody Drug Conjugates and Pharmaceutical Formulations

The compounds of the invention may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. The ADC will typically be administered parenterally i.e. infusion subcutaneous intramuscular intravenous intradermal intrathecal and epidural. The heterocyclic substituted bis 1 8 naphthalimide compounds may be administered parenterally or orally.

Pharmaceutical formulations of therapeutic antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention are typically prepared for parenteral administration i.e. bolus intravenous intratumor injection with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form. An antibody drug conjugate ADC having the desired degree of purity is optionally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents carriers excipients or stabilizers Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 1980 16th edition Osol A. Ed. in the form of a lyophilized formulation or an aqueous solution.

Acceptable diluents carriers excipients and stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG . For example lyophilized anti ErbB2 antibody formulations are described in WO 97 04801 expressly incorporated herein by reference.

The active pharmaceutical ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the ADC which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and gamma ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid.

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile which is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. . Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product.

Aqueous suspensions of the invention contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients include a suspending agent such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose croscarmellose povidone methylcellulose hydroxypropyl methylcelluose sodium alginate polyvinylpyrrolidone gum tragacanth and gum acacia and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide e.g. lecithin a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid e.g. polyoxyethylene stearate a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol e.g. heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate . The aqueous suspension may also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n propyl p hydroxy benzoate one or more coloring agents one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin.

The pharmaceutical compositions of ADC may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent such as a solution in 1 3 butane diol or prepared as a lyophilized powder. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils may conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid may likewise be used in the preparation of injectables.

The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example an aqueous solution intended for intravenous infusion may contain from about 3 to 500 g of the active ingredient per milliliter of solution in order that infusion of a suitable volume at a rate of about 30 mL hr can occur.

Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti oxidants buffers bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient and aqueous and non aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.

Although oral administration of protein therapeutics are disfavored due to hydrolysis or denaturation in the gut formulations of ADC suitable for oral administration may be prepared as discrete units such as capsules cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the ADC.

The formulations may be packaged in unit dose or multi dose containers for example sealed ampoules and vials and may be stored in a freeze dried lyophilized condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier for example water for injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Exemplary unit dosage formulations include a daily dose or unit daily sub dose as herein above recited or an appropriate fraction thereof of the active ingredient.

The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefore. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered parenterally orally or by any other desired route.

It is contemplated that the compounds of the present invention may be used to treat various diseases or disorders e.g. characterized by the overexpression of a tumor antigen. Exemplary conditions or disorders include benign or malignant tumors leukemia and lymphoid malignancies other disorders such as neuronal glial astrocytal hypothalamic glandular macrophagal epithelial stromal blastocoelic inflammatory angiogenic and immunologic disorders.

The compounds which are identified in the animal models and cell based assays can be further tested in tumor bearing higher primates and human clinical trials. Human clinical trials can be designed similar to the clinical trials testing the efficacy of the anti HER2 monoclonal antibody HERCEPTIN in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that had received extensive prior anti cancer therapy as reported by Baselga et al. 1996 J. Clin. Oncol. 14 737 744. The clinical trial may be designed to evaluate the efficacy of an ADC in combinations with known therapeutic regimens such as radiation and or chemotherapy involving known chemotherapeutic and or cytotoxic agents.

Generally the disease or disorder to be treated is cancer. Examples of cancer to be treated herein include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma sarcoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer lung cancer including small cell lung cancer non small cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer endometrial or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney or renal cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma anal carcinoma penile carcinoma as well as head and neck cancer.

The cancer will generally comprise HER2 expressing cells such that the ADC of the present invention are able to bind to the cancer cells. To determine ErbB2 expression in the cancer various diagnostic prognostic assays are available. In one embodiment ErbB2 overexpression may be analyzed by IHC e.g. using the HERCEPTEST Dako . Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a ErbB2 protein staining intensity criteria as follows Score 0 no staining is observed or membrane staining is observed in less than 10 of tumor cells Score 1 a faint barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10 of the tumor cells the cells are only stained in part of their membrane Score 2 a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells Score 3 a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Those tumors with 0 or 1 scores for ErbB2 overexpression assessment may be characterized as not overexpressing ErbB2 whereas those tumors with 2 or 3 scores may be characterized as overexpressing ErbB2.

Alternatively or additionally FISH assays such as the INFORM Ventana Co. Ariz. or PATHVISION Vysis Ill. may be carried out on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent if any of ErbB2 overexpression in the tumor.

The cancer to be treated herein may be one characterized by excessive activation of an ErbB receptor e.g. HER2. Such excessive activation may be attributable to overexpression or increased production of the ErbB receptor or an ErbB ligand. In one embodiment of the invention a diagnostic or prognostic assay will be performed to determine whether the patient s cancer is characterized by excessive activation of an ErbB receptor. For example ErbB gene amplification and or overexpression of an ErbB receptor in the cancer may be determined. Various assays for determining such amplification overexpression are available in the art and include the IHC FISH and shed antigen assays described above. Alternatively or additionally levels of an ErbB ligand such as TGF alpha. in or associated with the tumor may be determined according to known procedures. Such assays may detect protein and or nucleic acid encoding it in the sample to be tested. In one embodiment ErbB ligand levels in the tumor may be determined using immunohistochemistry IHC see for example Scher et al. 1995 Clin. Cancer Research 1 545 550. Alternatively or additionally one may evaluate levels of ErbB ligand encoding nucleic acid in the sample to be tested e.g. via FISH southern blotting or PCR techniques.

Moreover ErbB receptor or ErbB ligand overexpression or amplification may be evaluated using an in vivo diagnostic assay e.g. by administering a molecule such as an antibody which binds the molecule to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an ADC will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 20 mg kg of molecule is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. An exemplary dosage of ADC to be administered to a patient is in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 mg kg of patient weight.

For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the anti ErbB2 antibody. Other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

A compound of the invention may be combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen as combination therapy with a second compound having anti cancer properties. The second compound of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen may have complementary activities to the ADC of the combination such that they do not adversely affect each other.

The second compound may be a chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxic agent cytokine growth inhibitory agent anti hormonal agent and or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. A pharmaceutical composition containing an ADC of the invention may also have a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent such as a tubulin forming inhibitor a topoisomerase inhibitor or a DNA binder.

Alternatively or additionally the second compound may be an antibody which binds ErbB2 and blocks ligand activation of an ErbB receptor. The second antibody may be monoclonal antibody 2C4 or humanized 2C4. The second antibody may be conjugated with a cytotoxic or chemotherapeutic agent e.g. a 1 8 bis naphthalimide moiety. For example it may be desirable to further provide antibodies which bind to EGFR ErbB2 ErbB3 ErbB4 or vascular endothelial factor VEGF in the one formulation or dosing regimen. An exemplary combination therapy of the invention is a Formula I ADC and bevacizumab Avastin Genentech South San Francisco Calif. .

Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of an anticancer agent identified in accordance with this invention. The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities.

In one embodiment treatment with an ADC of the present invention involves the combined administration of an anticancer agent identified herein and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents including coadministration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents optionally along with treatment with an anti ErbB2 antibody such as trastuzumab. Chemotherapeutic agents include taxanes such as paclitaxel and doxetaxel and or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed. M. C. Perry Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1992 .

The anticancer agent may be combined with an anti hormonal compound e.g. an anti estrogen compound such as tamoxifen an anti progesterone such as onapristone EP 616812 or an anti androgen such as flutamide in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is hormone independent cancer the patient may previously have been subjected to anti hormonal therapy and after the cancer becomes hormone independent the anti ErbB2 antibody and optionally other agents as described herein may be administered to the patient. It may be beneficial to also coadminister a cardioprotectant to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and or radiation therapy.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments.

The combination therapy may provide synergy and prove synergistic i.e. the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect may be attained when the active ingredients are 1 co formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined unit dosage formulation 2 delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations or 3 by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy a synergistic effect may be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially e.g. by different injections in separate syringes. In general during alternation therapy an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially i.e. serially whereas in combination therapy effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together.

Also falling within the scope of this invention are the in vivo metabolic products of the compounds described herein to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation reduction hydrolysis amidation esterification enzymatic cleavage and the like of the administered compound. Accordingly the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof.

Metabolite products typically may be identified by preparing a radiolabelled e.g. Cor H ADC administering it parenterally in a detectable dose e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg kg to an animal such as rat mouse guinea pig monkey or to man allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours and isolating its conversion products from the urine blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite . The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion e.g. by MS LC MS or NMR analysis. In general analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the ADC compounds of the invention.

One vial containing 440 mg HERCEPTIN huMAb4D5 8 rhuMAb HER2 U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 antibody was dissolved in 50 mL MES buffer 25 mM MES 50 mM NaCl pH 5.6 and loaded on a cation exchange column Sepharose S 15 cm 1.7 cm that had been equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was then washed with the same buffer 5 column volumes . Trastuzumab was eluted by raising the NaCl concentration of the buffer to 200 mM. Fractions containing the antibody were pooled diluted to 10 mg mL and dialyzed into a buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate 50 mM NaCl 2 mM EDTA pH 6.5.

Trastuzumab dissolved in 500 mM sodium borate and 500 mM sodium chloride at pH 8.0 is treated with an excess of 100 mM dithiothreitol DTT . After incubation at 37 C. for about 30 minutes the buffer is exchanged by elution over Sephadex G25 resin and eluted with PBS with 1 mM DTPA. The thiol Ab value is checked by determining the reduced antibody concentration from the absorbance at 280 nm of the solution and the thiol concentration by reaction with DTNB Aldrich Milwaukee Wis. and determination of the absorbance at 412 nm. The reduced antibody dissolved in PBS is chilled on ice.

After about one hour an excess of maleimide is added to quench the reaction and cap any unreacted antibody thiol groups. The reaction mixture is concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration and 201 is purified and desalted by elution through G25 resin in PBS filtered through 0.2 m filters under sterile conditions and frozen for storage.
