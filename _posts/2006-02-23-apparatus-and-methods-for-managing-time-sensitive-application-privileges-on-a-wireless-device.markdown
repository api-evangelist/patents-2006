The described embodiments generally relate to wireless communications devices and computer networks. More particularly the described embodiments relate to apparatus and methods of managing time sensitive application privileges on a wireless device.

Wireless devices such as cellular telephones communicate packets including voice and data over a wireless network. Wireless devices are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers. These smart wireless devices such as cellular telephones have installed application programming interfaces APIs onto their local computer platform that allow software developers to create software applications that operate on the cellular telephone. The API sits between the wireless device system software and the software application making the cellular telephone functionality available to the application without requiring the software developer to have the specific cellular telephone system source code.

The software applications can come pre loaded at the time the cellular telephone is manufactured or the user may later request that additional programs be downloaded over cellular telecommunication carrier networks where the programs are executable on the wireless telephone. As a result users of wireless telephones can customize their cellular telephones with programs such as games printed media stock updates news or any other type of information or program available for download through the wireless network. Each of these software applications normally requires a license for the user to legally use the software on the wireless device.

If a license is meant to limit the use of the software application to a finite duration such as a specific number of days of use then once the license expires a user of the wireless device must typically either download a new license to incorporate into the software application or reinstall the entire software application if further use of the application is desired. The wireless device API normally checks the software either at the time execution is requested or at some other period to determine if the software is licensed for use on the platform. If the license has expired then the wireless device will not execute the unlicensed software application. Thus these types of licensing schemes rely on the wireless device having an accurate date time setting in order to determine whether or not a license has expired.

In some networks however the date time in the wireless device may not be established in a trustworthy fashion thereby making time based licensing decisions difficult or impossible. For example some communication systems protocols such as GSM Global System for Mobile Communications TDMA Time Division Multiple Access and UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System do not require time to be synchronized between the wireless device and the wireless network. As such the date time setting on the wireless device may be a setting input by a user of the device or may be obtained from some other time service such as NTP Network Time Protocol . In any case the API or other logic on the wireless device responsible for determining the expiration of a time based license cannot verify the authenticity of the time date setting on the wireless device in these systems.

Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide a system that enables reliable time based licensing decisions to be made on wireless devices operating on wireless networks that do not require time synchronization with the wireless device.

To address one or more of the drawbacks of the prior art the disclosed embodiments provide apparatus and methods for managing time sensitive application privileges on a wireless device. In one embodiment the disclosed apparatus and methods determine whether or not to execute a time sensitive application based on a given date time result. In another embodiment the disclosed apparatus and methods determine which one of a plurality of functional modes of an application to execute based on a given date time result.

In one embodiment a method of managing time sensitive application privileges on a wireless device comprises receiving a request to execute an application having a time sensitivity requirement and retrieving a date time result. The method further includes determining execution of the application based on the date time result.

In another embodiment a computer readable medium embodying means for managing time sensitive application privileges on a wireless device comprises at least one sequence of instructions wherein execution of the instructions by a processor causes the processor to perform the acts of receiving a request to execute an application having a time sensitivity requirement and retrieving a date time result. The acts further including associating a corresponding confidence factor with the date time result and determining execution of the application based on the confidence factor.

In yet another embodiment a wireless device comprises a means for receiving a request to execute an application having a time sensitivity requirement and a means for retrieving a date time result. Further the wireless device includes a means for associating a corresponding confidence factor with the date time result and a means for determining execution of the application based on the confidence factor.

In still another embodiment a wireless device comprises a computer platform operable to execute an application having a time sensitivity requirement. The wireless device further includes a time retrieval service resident on the computer platform and operable to retrieve a date time result. Additionally a date time determination module is resident on the computer platform and is operable determine an execution of the application based on the date time result.

The described embodiments include apparatus methods and computer readable media for the management of time based licensing privileges on a wireless device. These apparatus methods and computer readable medium provide a wireless device with logic that enables the wireless device to determine an authenticity and or level of confidence associated with a given date time result. In turn this logic provides the wireless device with the ability to make decisions regarding the expiration of a time sensitive license for an application executable on the wireless device. In addition or alternatively the logic provides the wireless device with the ability to choose between functional modes of an application based on either the existence of a given date time result or on a level of confidence associated with the given date time result. The logic may be accessed at any time such as when an application is initially executed or after the initial execution for example when an application reaches an operation or mode requiring a date time result. Thus the described embodiments advantageously provide apparatus methods and computer readable media that allow for managing license privileges on wireless devices especially on wireless networks that do not require time to be synchronized between the network and the device.

Referring to one embodiment of an application license management system comprises a plurality of wireless devices each having a computer platform operable to store and execute a time sensitive licensed application . Licensed application is associated with a licensing configuration that includes a license having a time sensitivity requirement . For example time sensitivity requirement includes a time requirement such as a time period or an expiration date and or time that indicates when the respective wireless device is licensed to execute application . Further time sensitivity requirement includes a confidence requirement such as a minimum confidence factor or level type of authentication that indicates a threshold of trustworthiness associated with time requirement . As such time sensitivity requirement defines one or more levels of date time authenticity and or trustworthiness required to execute one or more modes or levels of functionality of licensed application . Additionally each of the plurality of wireless devices includes a date time determination module operable to retrieve a date time result having a confidence factor indicating the accuracy authenticity and or trustworthiness of date time result . For example confidence factor may be based upon a source of date time result where a trusted and or authenticated source is associated with a higher confidence factor than an untrusted and or unknown and or unauthenticated source. Alternatively confidence factor may be based on the existence or absence of a date time result in the respective wireless device . For example the existence of date time result may imply or be associated with a predetermined confidence factor such as a 100 confidence whereas the absence of date time result may imply a different predetermined confidence factor such as 0 . In one embodiment the source of date time result may include one or more remote time systems in communication with the respective wireless device across a wireless network and a local time system maintained on the respective wireless device. Thus date time determination module is operable to compare date time result and confidence factor with the corresponding time sensitivity requirement in order to determine whether or not a license for application is in effect or is expired and to determine whether or not to execute one or more modes of licensed application .

The wireless devices can include any type of computerized wireless devices such as cellular telephone personal digital assistant laptop computer two way text pager and even a separate computer platform that has a wireless communication portal and which also may have a wired connection to a network or the Internet. The wireless device can be a remote slave or other device that does not have an end user thereof but simply communicates data across the wireless network such as a remote sensor a diagnostic tool a data relay and the like. Thus the apparatus methods and computer readable media for the management of time based licensing privileges on a wireless device can accordingly be performed on any form of wireless device or computer module including a wired or wireless communication portal including without limitation wireless modems PCMCIA cards access terminals personal computers telephones asset tags telemetry modules or any combination or sub combination thereof.

Additionally referring to each wireless device such as cellular telephone in this case has computer platform that can transmit data across wireless network and that can receive and execute software applications and display data transmitted from another computer device connected to wireless network . Computer platform also includes an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other chipset processor logic circuit or other data processing device. ASIC or other processor may execute an application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs such as licensed application in a memory of the wireless device. API is a runtime environment executing on the respective wireless device . One such runtime environment is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW software developed by Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego Calif. Other runtime environments may be utilized that for example operate to control the execution of applications on wireless computing devices. Memory may include read only and or random access memory RAM and ROM EPROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. Computer platform also includes a local database that can hold the software applications files or data not actively used in memory . Local database typically includes one or more flash memory cells but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device such as magnetic media EPROM EEPROM optical media tape or soft or hard disk. Additionally local database can ultimately hold a resident copy of licensed application . Further computer platform includes a communications module that enables data communications between the various components of the respective wireless device as well as providing for data communications between the respective wireless device and wireless network and other computer devices connected to the wireless network.

In one embodiment memory includes licensed application and its corresponding licensing configuration . Licensed application may be any hardware software programs firmware logic and or instructions executable by ASIC processing engine to perform some function on the respective wireless device. For example licensed application may include games printed media stock updates news word processing programs data processing programs graphics related programs media related programs communications related programs browser programs or any other type of information or program operable on the respective wireless device. In one embodiment referring to application is a software program received by the respective wireless device from an application download server located across wireless network .

As noted above licensing configuration includes the respective license corresponding to application as well as the associated time sensitivity requirements . License can be copied to the respective wireless device from server with application or license can be created on the respective wireless device as a file key or other resident object. Further due to its limited timeframe license is associated with time sensitivity requirement which includes time requirement and confidence requirement . As noted above time requirement includes a time period or an expiration date and or time that indicates when the respective license expires. Also as noted above confidence requirement includes a minimum threshold of trustworthiness associated with time requirement . It should be noted that in some embodiments application may have a plurality of application modes corresponding to varying levels of operational functionality. In this case there may be a corresponding plurality of time sensitivity requirements each having differing levels of time requirements and or confidence requirements . For example a basic application mode may provide for basic operational functionality of application while an advanced application mode may provide for additional operational functionality. In turn the basic application mode may correspond to a first set of time sensitivity requirements while the advanced application mode may correspond to a second set of time sensitivity requirements. For example the first set of time sensitivity requirements may allow licensed execution of the application for a longer period of time and or may require a lower level of confidence in a date time result than the second set of time sensitivity requirements. In this case the selected one of the plurality of application modes may be launched upon an initial execution of application based on date time result and or confidence factor . Alternatively the selected one of the plurality of application modes may be invoked based on date time result and or confidence factor retrieved after the initial execution of application for example when application reaches an operation having time sensitivity requirement .

Additionally licensing configuration may also include user defined parameters and or third party defined parameters that govern how date time determination module retrieves date time result . User defined parameters include predetermined or real time settings input by a user of the respective wireless device while third party defined parameters include predetermined settings established by some third party such as a wireless network carrier or application download server having some control over portions of the respective device and or application . For example both user defined parameters and third party defined parameters may define one or more of a plurality of fetch parameters that dictate how date time determination module retrieves a given date time result .

In one embodiment plurality of fetch parameters available for use by date time determination module include one or more of a confidence requirement parameter a retrieval duration parameter a retrieval cost parameter a retrieval performance parameter and additional fetch instructions . As noted above confidence requirement parameter includes a predetermined confidence factor such as a minimum confidence factor required to be associated with a given date time result . Retrieval duration parameter includes a predetermined time such as a maximum time to utilize in retrieving a given date time result . Retrieval cost parameter includes a predetermined monetary cost such as a maximum cost associated with retrieving a given date time result . Retrieval performance parameter includes a predetermined performance level such as a minimum performance level associated with the operational capabilities of the respective wireless device during the retrieval of a given date time result . Additional fetch instructions include any other parameters or guidelines to be followed by date time determination module in retrieving and or determining a given date time result .

For example for a user wishing to minimize the delay prior to execution of the application user defined parameters may be configured to direct date time determination module to retrieve a date time result associated with the fastest responding source. In another example for a user worried about cost user defined parameters may be configured to direct date time determination module to retrieve a date time result associated with the least cost source or with a source that will not exceed a given maximum cost. In yet another example since some of the sources of date time result may require more wireless device processing power than other sources for a user concerned about maintaining a given level of wireless device operational performance user defined parameters may be configured to direct date time determination module to retrieve a date time result associated with the least processor intensive source. Similarly for a third party wishing to guarantee a minimum confidence level third party defined parameters may be configured to direct date time determination module to retrieve a date time result associated with a source achieving the defined minimum confidence requirement. It should be understood that the above examples are not to be construed as limiting and that user defined parameters and third party defined parameters may include any combination of the plurality of fetch parameters and such combinations may vary depending on the given situation.

Further memory may include a user device identification ID that provides a unique and or authenticatable identifier and or description associated with the respective wireless device and or the user of the respective device. Examples of ID include a mobile identification number MIN a phone number a user name a social security number an Internet Protocol IP address a subscriber identity module SIM a security identification module any other type of tracking mechanism and any combination thereof.

In one embodiment some portion of third party defined parameters and or time sensitivity requirements may vary based on ID . For example if ID is associated with a user having a high dollar account with carrier the carrier may set third party defined parameters in a manner to associate an increased confidence factor with a user input date time result as compared to an ID associated with a low dollar account. It should be understood that this is but one non limiting example and many other schemes may be utilized depending on the given situation whereby some portion of third party defined parameters and or time sensitivity requirements may vary based on ID .

Additionally ASIC processing engine includes various processing subsystems embodied in hardware firmware software and combinations thereof that enable the functionality of the respective wireless device and the operability of the respective device on wireless network such as for exchanging data communications with other devices. For example processing subsystems may include one or any combination of subsystems such as sound non volatile memory file system transmit receive searcher physical layer link layer call processing layer main control remote procedure handset power management diagnostic digital signal processor vocoder messaging call manager Bluetooth Bluetooth Location Position LPOS position determination position engine user interface sleep data services security authentication USIM SIM voice services graphics universal serial bus USB camera camcorder interface and associated display drivers multimedia such as moving picture experts group MPEG standard general packet radio service GPRS standard etc.

In one embodiment processing subsystems include one or more time retrieval services operable through communications module to fetch a date time result from a remote or local source of time. For example each time retrieval service may be associated with a respective one of remotely located time systems or local time system . Remotely located time systems include for example a carrier based time system a trusted time server time system and an unauthenticated time system . Carrier based time system may be for example a time server associated with carrier such as the wireless network carrier that provides the respective wireless device with access to all or portions of wireless network for voice and or data communications. Trusted time server time system includes for example a time system associated with a trusted or authenticated third party. For example trusted time server time system may be a time source approved by the provider of the given application as being a trustworthy provider of time. Unauthenticated time system includes for example a source of time that is unapproved unverified and or unauthenticated and therefore may have a lower level of trustworthiness when compared to carrier based time system and trusted time server time system . Local time system may include for example a time system set by a user input and maintained in memory on the respective wireless device. Further each of carrier based time system a trusted time server time system and unauthenticated time system may provide a certificate along with a date time result to indicate the source and or authenticity of the time. For example certificate may include a digital signature a hash etc.

Additionally as mentioned above associated with each respective time retrieval service is a date time result and a corresponding confidence factor . It should be noted that confidence factor may be associated with the respective date time result by date time determination module by time retrieval service by another processing subsystem for example based on the respective time system or supplying the respective date time result or based on an associated certificate indicating the authenticity and or trustworthiness of the date time result. Alternatively confidence factor may be supplied by the respective time system or . Further each respective time retrieval service may include a retrieval duration factor a retrieval cost factor and a retrieval performance factor . Retrieval duration factor comprises an actual or estimated time required to retrieve the corresponding date time result . Retrieval cost factor comprises an actual or estimated cost required to retrieve the corresponding date time result . Retrieval performance factor comprises an actual or estimated affect on data processing performance of the respective wireless device during retrieval the corresponding date time result .

Date time determination module which may be any combination of hardware software firmware and executable logic includes a comparator operable to match a given configuration of fetch parameters with each of the factors of the respective time retrieval services in order to select one or more services and retrieve one or more date time results . Alternatively date time determination module may present the various factors in one of a plurality of user interface messages presented in a view on a user interface of the respective wireless device . In this case a user of the respective device may select one or more time retrieval service such as by providing an input through an input mechanism such as a keypad touch display voice recognition software etc. on the device.

The plurality of user interface messages may include any other information presentable to the user of the respective device during the operation of date time determination module . For example the plurality of user interface messages may further include any combination of a request to connect to a network to obtain a date time result a listing of available time retrieval services for obtaining a date time result a retrieved date time result a confidence factor a retrieval duration factor a retrieval cost factor a retrieval performance factor an actual retrieval duration an actual retrieval cost an actual retrieval performance a message indicating the date time retrieval is in process etc.

Date time determination module is included as a portion of API . API includes a class of software extensions that allow applications resident on computer platform such as application to access ASIC processor . These software extensions can communicate with processing subsystems on the wireless device which allows both data reads and commands. For example this software extension can send commands including register for log messages on behalf of the applications that invoke it. Each resident application on wireless device can create an instance of this new software extension to communicate with the subsystems independently. The module can then forward the responses of the subsystems to the requesting application or across wireless network to another computer device. For example this capability allows application download server and or carrier or any approved third party to remotely monitor and or control licensing privileges on the respective wireless device.

Wireless network area is illustrated to include a plurality of cellular telephones . In addition wireless network area includes wireless network as previously described with respect to . Here wireless network includes multiple base stations BTS and a mobile switching center MSC .

MSC may be connected to network interface specifically its component carrier network through either a wired or wireline connection network . For example network may comprise a data services network a switched voice services network often referred to as POTS plain old telephone service and or a combination of both including for example an Internet portion of a network for data information transfer and a POTS portion of a network for voice information transfer. For example typically in network network or Internet portions transfers data and the POTS portion transfers voice information transfer.

MSC may also be connected to the multiple BTS s by another network . Network may carry data and or switched voice information. For example network may comprise carry a data network a voice network and or a combination of both including for example an Internet portion of a network for data transfer and a POTS portion of a network for voice information transfer.

BTS are wirelessly connected to exemplary cellular telephones in wireless network area . For example BTS may ultimately broadcast messages wirelessly to cellular telephones or receive messages wirelessly from cellular telephones via switched voice services data transfer services including short messaging service SMS or other over the air methods.

As noted the second main component of is network interface . Specifically network interface is shown to include carrier network data link and local area network LAN . The features and functions associated with data link and LAN are described below with reference to server environment .

Carrier network is any regional national or international network offering switched voice communication and or data communication services. As such carrier network may include switched voice or data service provider communications facilities and lines including data and or switched voice information or any combination of both including for example an Internet portion of a network for data transfer and a POTS portion of a network for voice information transfer. In one embodiment carrier network controls messages generally in the form of data packets sent to or received from mobile switching center MSC .

The third main component of is server environment . In one embodiment server environment is the environment wherein the above described application download server functions. As illustrated server environment may further include a separate data repository and a data management server .

Application download server can be in communication over LAN network of network interface with separate data repository for storing applications and or licensing configurations to download to wireless devices. Further data management server may be in communication with application download server to provide post processing capabilities data flow control etc. Data management server may be a network carrier server for example a server that manages user account information or a server that provides trustworthy date time results. Application download server data repository and data management server may be present on the illustrated network with any other network components that are needed to provide cellular telecommunication services. Application download server data repository and or data management server communicate with carrier network through a data link of network interface such as the Internet a secure LAN WAN or other network.

In operation referring to one embodiment of a method for managing time sensitive application privileges on a wireless device includes receiving a request to execute an application having a time sensitivity requirement Block . For example API may control the launching of applications on the respective wireless device. When licensed application is requested for launching date time determination module receives the request to execute and application and also receives or accesses the associated licensing configuration .

Based on licensing configuration date time determination module then retrieves a date time result Block . Date time determination module may utilize any of the factors associated with licensing configuration to determine which time retrieval service is utilized to fetch a date time result . For example comparator may review the given configuration of fetch parameters as well as the available time retrieval services in order to find a service that matches the fetch configuration. In one embodiment for example date time determination module and the respective licensed application communicate and automatically fetch a date time result that complies with the given license and time sensitivity requirements . In another embodiment date time determination module automatically fetches a given date time result based on a user defined parameter or a third party defined parameter . In another embodiment date time determination module present the user of the respective wireless device with the available time retrieval services along with their associated factors and then retrieves one or more date time results based on a selection input by the user.

Further the method includes associating a corresponding confidence factor with date time result Block . As mentioned above in one embodiment this association may be performed by date time determination module based on a source i.e. the respective time system or providing the given date time result . Alternatively the association may be based on a certificate indicating a level of authenticity and or trustworthiness of the given date time result . It should be understood however that these examples are to be construed as non limiting and any scheme may be utilized to associate a given date time with a confidence factor .

Additionally the method includes determining execution of the application based on the confidence factor Block . For example date time determination module automatically initiates execution of licensed application upon receipt of date time result that achieves the given fetch parameter configuration. In one embodiment in order to determine whether or not to execute licensed application date time determination module compares licensing configuration with the retrieved date time result and its confidence factor to ensure that the licensing configuration is achieved. In another embodiment date time determination module passes the retrieved date time result and its associated confidence factor to licensed application which ensures that licensing configuration is achieved and then sends an execute or do not execute command to date time determination module or API to either execute the application or to provide user with a message indicating that the application is not executable based on the retrieved date time result.

Referring to in another specific example of the operation of the described embodiments a user of the respective wireless device provides an input to input mechanism that generates a launch application request message . Launch application request message references a given licensed application and hence the corresponding licensing configuration . As such date time determination module ultimately receives this request or receives an associated request for a date time and generates a date time request message that is received by ASIC processor or an associated operating system component of the respective wireless device. ASIC processor then supplies an initial reply message to date time determination module .

Initial reply message may be any one of a plurality of messages relating to the current state of time maintained by the respective wireless device. For example initial reply message may be a message indicating that ASIC processor does not have any time. In this case date time determination module sends user an initial status message . For example initial status message is one of the plurality of user interface messages in a view that relays the fact that no time is currently available and that requests permission to retrieve a date time result from a remote time system . In another embodiment initial reply message may be a list of available time retrieval services and their associated factors and . In this case date time determination module generates initial status message which is one of the plurality of user interface messages in a view indicating the available time retrieval services and their associated factors and and prompts user for a selection.

Upon receiving initial status message user may then provide a user selection message indicating a choice of the user as to how to proceed. Continuing with the above listed examples user selection message may indicate a permission to utilize a remote time system in the retrieval of date time result or may indicate a selected time retrieval service based on a user s desired confidence factor retrieval duration retrieval cost and or retrieval performance. For example if user only desires to utilize a basic functional mode of application the user may select one of a plurality of time retrieval services having a relatively low confidence factor compared to other services that have higher confidence factors that meet a higher threshold corresponding to a more advanced function mode .

In any case date time determination module then generates a date time request message based on the received user selection message . The respective wireless device processes this date time request message and transmits it across wireless network to a corresponding remote time system . In turn the respective remote time system returns a date time response message which includes at least date time result and may also include confidence factor certificate and or any other associated factor relating to the retrieval of the date time result. If the received date time result and the associated confidence factor meet the licensing configuration then date time determination module executes licensed application message . If the received date time result and the associated confidence factor do not meet the licensing configuration or if no date time result and or confidence factor is received then date time determination module sends a status message to user . In this case status message which is one of the plurality of user interface messages in a view indicating for example that licensed application cannot be executed.

It should be understood that the above message sequence is but one of a plurality of message sequence scenarios and that many alternatives exist depending on the given situation. For example rather than initially communicating with user i.e. messages and date time determination module may automatically retrieve a date time result based on an associated licensing configuration .

While the various disclosed embodiments have been illustrated and described it will be clear that the subject matter of this document is not limited to these embodiments only. Numerous other modifications changes variations substitutions and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosed embodiments as described in the claims.
