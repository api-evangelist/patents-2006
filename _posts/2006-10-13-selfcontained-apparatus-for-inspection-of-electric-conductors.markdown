The present invention relates to the field of electric conductor inspection. In particular the invention relates to a self contained apparatus for inspecting energized and de energized conductors.

Utility companies have long sought to reap the benefits of early detection of overhead power line conductor defects. Identifying conductor issues early can facilitate the maintenance and replacement decision making process and prioritize repairs that should be made. Correctly separating troubled conductors from those with additional life can help companies avoid expensive maintenance work line drops failures and regional outages.

A number of methods and technologies have been used to detect damaged or aged transmission conductors. These include visual inspection infrared thermography and overhead line corrosion detection OHLCD .

The traditional method for detecting damage to an overhead transmission conductor has required power company line personnel to disassemble and remove tower hardware and armor rods and open up the conductor for visual inspection. This hands on method of inspection requires the conductor to be de energized in most cases. Further line personnel are only able to detect damage to the outer strands of the conductor and cannot see critical sub surface damage.

OHLCD technology uses a trolley unit that contains both a corrosion detector and a data telemetry system. The unit is attached to the conductor in question and towed along the conductor by a second lightweight motorized radio controlled trolley. While this technology is able to detect corrosion in the conductor core it does not look at the effects of corrosion on the outer conductor strands. Also the unit is not capable of testing areas under suspension clamps unless they are removed thus requiring the conductor to be de energized. Further OHLCD technology does not detect strand breaks or non functional splice repairs.

Infrared thermography and X ray techniques have improved the ability of utility companies to detect issues with substation and tower hardware. However these techniques have been less successful at the detection of flaws in overhead transmission conductors. Infrared or X ray surveys of transmission conductors require an airplane and other expensive equipment. The costs of such services and the limited results they yield have yet to demonstrate a real cost benefit justification.

The high cost and time intensive nature of the methods described above coupled with tight operational and maintenance budgets have resulted in infrequent conductor inspection and a growing risk of failure that is neither quantified nor fully understood. As a result companies are forced to make decisions regarding the replacement of power transmission conductors without proper diagnosis tools. These decisions often result in the replacement of conductors with remaining life and the non replacement of conductors near failure thereby resulting in substantial costs per year for unneeded replacements. Armed with solid information about the relative condition of various transmission conductors utility personnel can make more effective operational and maintenance decisions that save the company substantial amounts of both time and money.

Accordingly there is a need for a self contained apparatus that allows companies to test conductors accurately and efficiently for corrosion poorly installed splices and broken strands of the conductors without de energizing the conductors or disassembling hardware.

Therefore it is an object of the invention to provide a self contained apparatus that can detect small flaws in a conductor quickly and efficiently whether the conductor is energized or de energized.

Referring to the present invention utilizes Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducers EMAT to monitor diagnose and identify failures in an energized or de energized conductor i.e. transmission lines. An EMAT consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The EMAT couples ultrasonic energy into conductive materials. The simplest form of an EMAT is a wire loop held near a conductive material with a magnet placed above the wire. The transmitter operates based on principles similar to an electric motor which develops torsional waves. As shown a copper coil is placed as close to a test specimen as possible and an alternating current is injected. This current produces a dynamic magnetic field H which varies in time and space. The resulting eddy current density J produced in the test specimen is given by Maxwell s equation represented by 1 From Maxwell s equations for quasi static conditions this eddy current flows in the test specimen . To create a force in the test specimen permanent magnets with high intensity are placed directly over the coil to immerse the test specimen with magnetic flux. The eddy current interacts with the external magnetic flux density B to produce a force density given by 2 Coupled to the lattice of the test specimen this force is called a Lorentz force and acts in a direction as indicated in . An elastic disturbance involving particle displacements u and velocity du dt propagates through the test specimen . The receiver of the EMAT works similar to an electric generator. When the elastic waves pass under the receiver the surface of the specimen is displaced in the magnetic field. Because of the resultant elastic displacement of the test specimen an electric field E arises according to the following equation 

A further explanation of electromagnetic acoustic transducers and scientific principles related to analyzing in service conductive materials is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 382 029 issued to Shoureshi et al.

Referring to an EMAT system according to an embodiment of the invention is illustrated and shown generally at reference numeral . The EMAT system is self contained in a housing and includes transmitter and receiver units an on board microcontroller wireless communication A D and D A converters a 12 volt power supply a pulse generator DC to DC converters and remote command and control modules. An on board microprocessor performs advanced mathematical analysis and uses software that includes fuzzy logic neural network and Adaptive Resonant Theory ART network for system operation fault detection and classification. The EMAT system further includes transducers a power amplifier and electronics for the operation of the transducers. A schematic of the EMAT system is shown in .

The housing includes an upper housing portion A and a lower housing portion B. As illustrated the housing is a convex shaped enclosure made of a material such as plastic to prevent the creation of corona and to withstand over 500 kV and over 1000 amps. It should be appreciated that any suitable material and shape may be used for the housing .

The upper housing portion A includes an attachment device for attaching a hot stick to allow the EMAT system to be positioned on high voltage lines. The EMAT system is powered by a 12 volt battery not shown positioned behind a retainer plate for portability. The battery is keyed to be received in a battery slot on a front of the upper housing portion A to prevent an incorrect battery installation.

A bounding fork may be attached to a side of the lower housing portion B. The bounding fork is used to discharge any electricity or arcs that could damage the electronics of the EMAT system . This is done by allowing the bounding forks to make contact with a conductor prior to positioning the EMAT system on the conductor and subjecting the EMAT system to a high voltage.

The EMAT system is operated using control switches such as buttons A D on a front of the upper and lower housing portions A and B. The buttons A D may be operated by a remote hot stick such as hot stick and are used to perform a full conductor diagnostic and monitoring cycle. As illustrated button A is the on off switch button B is the test switch button C is the open switch and button D is the close switch. Light emitting diodes LEDs A G are also positioned on the front of the upper and lower housing portions A and B to indicate the results of the diagnostic and monitoring cycle. LED G indicates that the power is on LED F indicates that the EMAT system hardware is ready and LED E indicates that the EMAT system is ready to perform a test. The LED s A D indicate one of four conductor conditions normal A minor abnormal B major abnormal C and corrosion D . Additionally if the battery is fully discharged every LED A G on the EMAT system will illuminate indicating that the EMAT system is not functional.

The upper housing portion A and lower housing portion B are moved from an open position to a closed position around a conductor by two screw guides A and B. The screw guides A and B are operably connected to a worm gear and a feedback controlled electric motor shown in to allow the upper and lower housing portions A and B to be moved between the open position and the closed position remotely in the presence of high repelling forces that magnets in each of the upper housing portion A and lower housing portion B produce.

As shown in the EMAT system includes a pair of recesses and positioned in the upper housing portion A and lower housing portion B respectively. Each of the recesses and are adapted to receive a transmitter receiver cartridge like that shown in . As illustrated in the EMAT system uses upper and lower transmitter receiver cartridges A and B. The cartridges A and B are removable and can be interchanged with other cartridges to allow the EMAT system to perform testing on conductors of various sizes. Each of the upper and lower cartridges A and B have transmitter and receiver coils. The transmitter and receiver coils of the upper and lower cartridges A and B are connected in series and function electrically as a single transmitter or receiver coil in the EMAT system . The cartridges A and B include a concave section to allow a conductor to be received therein between the upper and lower cartridges A and B during testing.

The EMAT system is used to analyze the mechanical integrity of electric power conductors. The system generates micro scale displacement waves that are propagated through the conductor under investigation. By analyzing the conductor response to the combined torsional and longitudinal excitations the EMAT system reports the condition of the conductor.

The EMAT system may be described in terms of four functional units a transmitter a receiver a motor driver and a microcontroller. Since the EMAT system needs to create electric pulses having a frequency between about 50 KHz and 200 KHz an amplitude of between about 300 volts and 500 volts and a current of about 30 amperes from a 12 volt battery the transmitter includes a pulse generator circuit having an H Bridge component a high voltage generator circuit and a clocks and power on reset generator circuit . Example circuits for each of the generators is shown in and a block diagram of a programmable interval timer used in the clocks and power on reset generator circuit is shown in .

Referring to the pulse generator circuit uses an opto coupler such as Toshiba s TLP2631 to create electrical isolation between a transducer drive circuitry and the clock and power on reset circuitry shown in . An H Bridge is used to generate excitation pulses and includes four switches that are activated to generate positive and negative pulses. PHA and PHB are alternately switched low. As a result the output of the opto coupler goes low alternately thus current flows from pin to pin of the J3 which is connected to the transmitter coil. In the next stage PHA goes high and PHB goes low and similar operations occur in Q2 and Q3 resulting in opposite voltages being applied to the J3 pins causing current to flow in the opposite direction

In the second stage the active component is the MOSFET gate driver IC TC4424 . This driver is capable of sinking high current 3 A and has very low output resistances. It also shifts the signal from a Transistor Transistor Logic TTL compatible voltage level 5V 0.6V to a MOSFET gate driver voltage level 12V .

Referring to the high voltage generator circuit converts 12 volt pulses to high voltage pulses for example 400 volts. The heart of the high voltage generator circuit is the NE555 Timer IC . It is configured in mono stable mode. A clock of 33 KHz is fed to the trigger input pin . C2 works as a DC de coupling capacitor. R7 R10 and C3 form the timing component. The width of the output pulse has a canonical expression t 1.1 R C sec.

Referring to the clocks and power on reset circuit initiates the creation of pulses upon the user s command by pushing the test button B on the front of the EMAT system . The pulse generating circuit also uses an on board processor clock to assure the desired frequency of the pulse 50 KHz to 200 KHz . The central active component of this circuit is the CHMOS Programmable Interval Timer PIT 82C54 .

As shown in the PIT has three independent 16 bit counters blocks . Addressing inputs A and A are used to select these counters. A RD READ bar signal reads from the selected counter and a INR WRITE bar signal writes value to the selected counter. With a fixed clock input the counters blocks work as timers. On the EMAT system the counters blocks are setup as Mode III timers. Counters block and block receive a 10 MHz clock signal from a crystal oscillator. Depending on the microcontroller counter block is set up to generate corresponding frequencies. Counter block generates a delay between successive pulse bursts.

An output low on counter block sets gate high and vice versa because of inverter UB between them. Also the output of counter block controls activation of PHA and PHB outputs when there is a low on POR. The NOR gate UB 74HC02 ensures that there is no 33 KHz pulse going out of this circuit when the POR is high.

Referring to the receiver includes a signal amplifier and a negative voltage generator . Signatures from a conductor will be in the form of current induced by the reflective displacement waves of the conductor and the magnetic field of the receiver. This signature needs to be conditioned and amplified and to represent both a positive and a negative range of these signatures.

As shown in J is the input from the receiver coil. The voltage induced in the receiver coil appears here. The following capacitor 183 KpF is being used to block any DC components of the input. Because this circuit is concerned with the signal variability only it does not count on the DC level.

As shown in the active element of the negative voltage generator circuit is the DCP021212DP . This is an unregulated DC DC converter. This provides negative voltage on pin and a positive voltage on pin . The external capacitors connected to these two pins serve to stabilize the output voltage and hence eliminate noise.

Referring to a motor driver circuit uses an LMD18200 T0 chip . It is an H bridge for controlling the DC motor shown in by changing supply voltage polarity and turning the motor on and off. The DC motor is used to open and close the EMAT system . The motor is operated off of the EMAT system 12 volt battery. Since it has to rotate both clockwise and counter clockwise to open and close the EMAT system its polarity needs to be switched. Also it uses an optical feedback sensor to prevent over closing or over opening the EMAT system thus damaging the EMAT system .

Referring to the EMAT system uses a microcontroller that is centered on the VersaLogic Corporation s Bobcat PC 104 module . The Bobcat module also contains integrated peripheral connections such as a serial port utilized by the EMAT system . Attached to the Bobcat is a PC 104 compatible Chase Scientific CS 210 Data Acquisition DAQ card . The DAQ card utilizes a 12 bit Analog to Digital Converter A D to provide the digital data to the EMAT system . It should be appreciated that any suitable DAQ card or PC 104 module may be used.

As shown in the majority of the EMAT system electronics are housed in the upper housing portion A. The Bobcat processor module and Chase Scientific DAQ card can be seen in a stacked orientation on the right side of this figure. A motor drive assembly that includes the motor and a gear drive are located near the center of the upper housing portion A. Other motor drive electronics high voltage coil driver electronics can be seen on the left side of this figure. As shown in the lower housing portion B of the EMAT system houses the receiver amplifier .

The EMAT system does not require an operator to have any special skills to operate the EMAT system . Instead the EMAT system includes built in intelligence to perform feature extraction and signature analysis using nonlinear signal processing. Thus the EMAT system can provide an operator with an indication of the extent of damage in the conductor by using its intelligent built in software and highly specialized filters and algorithms to quickly and accurately detect corrosion poorly installed splices broken strands in the conductor loss of cross section in anchor rods and ground melt risers.

The EMAT system is used by placing the EMAT system on an electric power conductor. This is done using the hot stick as shown in . The hot stick is made from insulating fiberglass and is necessary to insulate a user from the energized high voltage power line.

As shown in once the EMAT system has been installed on the conductor block an amplified signal is transmitted to the conductor by the transmitter block and then received by the receiver block . The amplified signal is stored in the memory of the microcomputer and is processed through an artificial neural network blocks . Artificial neural networks have been applied widely for pattern recognition problems. The most popular one is a Multilayer Perceptron MLP classifier based on the back propagation learning rule BP algorithm . Since the main issue in classification is robustness to variances of general test sets an Adaptive Resonant Theory ART neural network for the classification has been used.

The ART neural network blocks resolves the instability of feedforward instar outstar systems. The ART neural network blocks is not only stable enough for significant past learning but also adaptable enough to incorporate new information whenever it may appear. The ART neural network blocks is composed of three layers and in the first layer the preprocessing for the other layers is accomplished. Usually the input pattern preprocessing includes noise reduction contrast enhancement normalization and input transformation.

The EMAT transmitter generates pulses and impinges them onto the conductor through transmitting coils. The EMAT receiver captures the reflected signals and amplifies them. The raw data is acquired at a very high sampling frequency. An eight step advanced signal processing and filtering process is used. This is done by obtaining ASCII coded frequency sweep data files making data sets mean zeroed applying a high order band pass filter overlapping data files on a time domain extracting the maximum value from each band pass filtered data and constructing one time domain data file strategically removing the initial points and final data points applying a running average filter and re sampling of the data. A low pass filter is applied to reduce the noise influence.

After analysis an overall damage rating is given which quantifies the amount of damage that a given conductor has sustained. The information on the EMAT system operation and the result of diagnostics after a classification process are displayed by turning on different LEDs on the front of the EMAT system .

A self contained apparatus for inspection of energized and de energized electric conductors is described above. Various details of the invention may be changed without departing from its scope. Furthermore the foregoing description of the preferred embodiments of the invention and best mode for practicing the invention are provided for the purpose of illustration only and not for the purpose of limitation.
