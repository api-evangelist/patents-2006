The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

To initiate the flow of oil and or other materials in a well a conventional shaped charge warhead or perforator is fired through the well casing the cement sheath and into the earthen formation. A shaped charge device comprises a shaped charge liner backed by high explosives. When the explosives are detonated the shaped charge device forms a high velocity forward moving penetrator or jet that is capable of deeply penetrating the targeted material.

Output of a well is dependent on several factors including the size of the hole made by the perforator the hole shape and the penetration depth. Fracturing fluids are pumped into the hole to fracture the rock formation and special agents in the fluid hold the fractures open to allow flow. Small diameter holes as produced by conventional shaped charges have a tendency to clog with these agents. Currently available perforators are designed to produce deep penetration but with a very small diameter hole.

One method of increasing hole size uses multiple initiation points to alter the perforator jet output. This method requires significantly changing the current perforator manufacturing procedures the perforator external hardware and the way the perforators are integrated into the holding apparatus. Other methods to alter jet output are being investigated. U.S. Pat. No. 6 925 924 issued on Aug. 9 2005 includes a detailed description of the well perforation process and is incorporated by reference herein.

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus and method for increasing the size of holes created in well bores for initiating material flow.

Another object of the invention is to provide a shaped charge that will produce a fan like jet to create slotted holes in rock formations.

One aspect of the invention is a shaped charge comprising a case having an open front end an external surface and a longitudinal axis all transverse cross sections of the case being bi symmetric an explosive material disposed in the case the case including at least one opening extending from the external surface to the explosive material for initiation of the explosive material and a liner disposed over the explosive material wherein a pair of substantially identical longitudinal slots are formed on the external surface the longitudinal slots being about 180 degrees apart.

Another aspect of the invention is a shaped charge comprising a case having on open front end an external surface and a longitudinal axis explosive material disposed in the case the case including at least one opening extending from the external surface to the explosive material for initiation of the explosive material and a liner disposed over the explosive material all transverse cross sections of the liner being bi symmetric at least one transverse cross section having a liner thickness that varies.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Conventional shaped charges or perforators are initiated from a single point at the rear of the warhead and are designed to produce a round axi symmetric jet. If two initiation points are used a fan like jet can be produced. However a fan jet can also be produced with single point initiation and without altering the normal initiation hardware. This is done by using a bi symmetric shaped charge liner or a bi symmetric shaped charge case.

A first aspect of the invention relates to shaped charges with bi symmetric cases. is a side sectional view of one embodiment of a shaped charge . is a sectional view along the line B B of . Shaped charge includes a case having an open front end an external surface and a longitudinal axis X X. Explosive material is disposed in the case . At least one opening extends from the external surface of the case to the explosive material for initiation of the explosive material . A liner is disposed over the explosive material . A pair of substantially identical longitudinal slots are formed on the external surface of the case . The longitudinal slots are spaced about 180 degrees apart.

All transverse cross sections i.e. taken in the manner of of the case are bi symmetric. Bi symmetric means that a plane perpendicular to the section of and passing through line Z Z where line Z Z bisects the slots will produce two case halves that are mirror images of each other. In addition bi symmetric means that a plane perpendicular to the section of and passing through line Y Y where line Y Y is shifted 90 degrees from line Z Z will produce two case halves that are also mirror images of each other.

In general case and or liner may be shaped in any of a variety of ways including but not limited to conical bi conical tulip hemispherical trumpet bell shaped hyperboloid hyperbolic paraboloid and parabolic. As shown in case may include a closed rear end and side walls wherein the pair of longitudinal slots are formed in the side walls . Preferably the at least one opening extending from the external surface to the explosive material is disposed on the longitudinal axis X X of the case .

While rectangular slots are shown slots may comprise any shape. The cross sections of slots may be constant or may vary although the pair of slots will be substantially identical to each other to maintain bi symmetry. The depth width and height of the slots may be constant or may vary. The slots may extend in a forward direction to front end as shown in or may end short of the front end . The slots may extend all the way to the rear end of the case or may stop short of the rear end as shown in .

Preferably the liner is axi symmetric about the longitudinal axis X X of the case . This means that for any transverse cross section of the liner the liner thickness will be constant in that cross section. Of course the liner thickness may vary in the longitudinal direction as long as the liner is axi symmetric about the axis X X.

While generally V shaped slots are shown slots may comprise any shape. The cross sections of slots may be constant or may vary although the pair of slots will be substantially identical to each other to maintain bi symmetry. For example a portion of slot may include a rectangular cross section as shown in slot . The depth width and height of the slots may be constant or may vary. The slots may extend in a forward direction to front end or may end short of the front end . The slots may extend all the way to the rear end of the case or may stop short of the rear end. It is noted that case is bi symmetric about axes Z Z and Y Y.

The shaped charge is preferably initiated along the center axis X X. As the detonation wave moves forward the liner is preferentially collapsed due to the bi symmetric case producing a jet profile that will cut a slotted hole through the well casing cement sheath and rock formation.

A second aspect of the invention relates to shaped charges with bi symmetric liners. is a side sectional view of one embodiment of a shaped charge . is a sectional view along the line B B of showing only the liner. Shaped charge includes a case having an open front end an external surface and a longitudinal axis X X. Explosive material is disposed in the case . At least one opening extends from the external surface of the case to the explosive material for initiation of the explosive material . The at least one opening is preferably disposed on the longitudinal axis X X. A liner is disposed over the explosive material .

The shaped charge is preferably initiated along the center axis X X. As the detonation wave moves forward the liner is preferentially collapsed due to its bi symmetry producing a jet profile that will cut a slotted hole through the well casing cement sheath and rock formation.

In the transverse cross section of the liner is generally annular and includes a pair of substantially identical increased thickness portions located substantially 180 degrees apart. is exemplary only differently shaped cross sections and differently shaped increased thickness portions are within the scope of the invention as long as the section is bi symmetric.

In the special case where the portions and portions are all substantially identical to each other then the cross section is quad symmetric about the axes Y Y Z Z and the pair of axes that are 45 degrees offset from Y Y and Z Z.

Preferably the case is axi symmetric about the longitudinal axis X X. In general case and or liner may be shaped in any of a variety of ways including but not limited to conical bi conical tulip hemispherical trumpet bell shaped hyperboloid hyperbolic paraboloid and parabolic.

The inventive shaped charges generate fan like jets that produce slotted holes in rock formations. In the case of bi symmetric liners a simple change to the press punches used for manufacturing liners allows the fabrication and loading of bi symmetric liners with existing perforator cases on existing production equipment all with a minimal additional cost burden. For bi symmetric cases minimal additional manufacturing is required to produce a slotting perforator that is capable of using existing initiation hardware.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
