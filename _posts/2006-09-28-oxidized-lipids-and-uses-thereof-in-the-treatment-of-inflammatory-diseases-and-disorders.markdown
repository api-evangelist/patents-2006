This is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 567 543 filed Feb. 8 2006 which is a National Phase of PCT Patent Application No. PCT IL2004 000453 filed May 27 2004 which is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 445 347 filed May 27 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 6 838 452 issued Jan. 4 2005. The contents of the above applications are all incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to novel oxidized lipids and to methods employing oxidized lipids for treating or preventing an inflammation associated with endogenous oxidized lipids. The methods of the present invention can be utilized in treating or preventing inflammation associated diseases and disorders such as for example atherosclerosis and related disorders autoimmune diseases or disorders and proliferative disease or disorders.

Cardiovascular disease is a major health risk throughout the industrialized world. Atherosclerosis the most prevalent of cardiovascular diseases is the principal cause of heart attack stroke and gangrene of the extremities and as such the principle cause of death in the United States. Atherosclerosis is a complex disease involving many cell types and molecular factors for a detailed review see Ross 1993 Nature 362 801 809 . The process which occurs in response to insults to the endothelium and smooth muscle cells SMCs of the wall of the artery consists of the formation of fibrofatty and fibrous lesions or plaques preceded and accompanied by inflammation. Plaque destabilization may lead to further complications such as rupture and thrombosis which result from an excessive inflammatory fibroproliferative response to numerous different forms of insults. For example shear stresses are thought to be responsible for the frequent occurrence of atherosclerotic plaques in regions of the circulatory system where turbulent blood flow occurs such as branch points and irregular structures.

The first observable event in the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque occurs when inflammatory cells such as monocyte derived macrophages adhere to the vascular endothelial layer and transmigrate through to the sub endothelial space. Elevated plasma LDL levels lead to lipid engorgement of the vessel walls with adjacent endothelial cells producing oxidized low density lipoprotein LDL . In addition lipoprotein entrapment by the extracellular matrix leads to progressive oxidation of LDL by lipoxygenases reactive oxygen species peroxynitrite and or myeloperoxidase. These oxidized LDL s are then taken up in large amounts by monocytes through scavenger receptors expressed on their surfaces.

Lipid filled monocytes and smooth muscle derived cells SMCs are called foam cells and are the major constituent of the fatty streak. Interactions between foam cells endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells surrounding them produce a state of chronic local inflammation which can eventually lead to activation of endothelial cells increased macrophage apoptosis smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration and the formation of a fibrous plaque Hajjar D P and Haberland M E J. Biol Chem 1997 Sep. 12 272 37 22975 78 . Plaque rupture and thrombosis occlude the blood vessels concerned and thus restrict the flow of blood resulting in ischemia a condition characterized by a lack of oxygen supply in tissues of organs due to inadequate perfusion. When the involved arteries block the blood flow to the heart a person is afflicted with a heart attack when the brain arteries occlude the person experiences a stroke. When arteries to the limbs narrow the result is severe pain decreased physical mobility and possibly the need for amputation.

Oxidized LDL has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis by its action on monocytes and smooth muscle cells and by inducing endothelial cell apoptosis impairing anticoagulant balance in the endothelium. Oxidized LDL also inhibits anti atherogenic HDL associated breakdown of oxidized phospholipids Mertens A and Holvoet P FASEB J 2001 October 15 12 2073 84 . This association is also supported by many studies demonstrating the presence of oxidized LDL in the plaques in various animal models of atherogenesis and the retardation of atherogenesis through inhibition of oxidation by pharmacological and or genetic manipulations see for example Witztum J and Steinberg D Trends Cardiovasc Med 2001 April May 11 3 4 93 102 for a review of current literature . Indeed oxidized LDL and malondialdehyde MDA modified LDL have been recently proposed as accurate blood markers for 1and 2stages of coronary artery disease U.S. Pat. No. 6 309 888 to Holvoet et al. and U.S. Pat No. 6 255 070 to Witztum et al. .

Reduction of LDL oxidation and activity has been the target of a number of suggested clinical applications for treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Bucala et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 534 discloses methods for the modulation of lipid peroxidation by reducing advanced glycosylation end product lipid characteristic of age disease and diabetes related foam cell formation. Tang et al. at Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. U.S. Pat. No. 5 945 308 have disclosed the identification and proposed clinical application of a Human Oxidized LDL Receptor in the treatment of cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases and cancer.

Because of the presumed role of the excessive inflammatory fibroproliferative response in atherosclerosis and ischemia a growing number of researchers have attempted to define an autoimmune component of vascular injury. In autoimmune diseases the immune system recognizes and attacks normally non antigenic body components autoantigens in addition to attacking invading foreign antigens. The autoimmune diseases are classified as auto or self antibody mediated or cell mediated diseases. Typical autoantibody mediated autoimmune diseases are myasthenia gravis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ITP while typical cell mediated diseases are Hashimoto s thyroiditis and type I Juvenile Diabetes.

The recognition that immune mediated processes prevail within atherosclerotic lesions stemmed from the consistent observation of lymphocytes and macrophages in the earliest stages namely the fatty streaks. These lymphocytes which include a predominant population of CD4 cells the remainder being CD8 cells were found to be more abundant over macrophages in early lesions as compared with the more advanced lesions in which this ratio tends to reverse. These findings posed questions as to whether they reflect a primary immune sensitization to a possible antigen or alternatively stand as a mere epiphenomenon of a previously induced local tissue damage. Regardless of the factors responsible for the recruitment of these inflammatory cells to the early plaque they seem to exhibit an activated state manifested by concomitant expression of MHC class II HLA DR and interleukin IL receptor as well as leukocyte common antigen CD45R0 and the very late antigen 1 VLA 1 integrin.

The on going inflammatory reaction in the early stages of the atherosclerotic lesion may either be the primary initiating event leading to the production of various cytokines by the local cells i.e. endothelial cells macrophages smooth muscle cells and inflammatory cells or it may be that this reaction is a form of the body s defense immune system towards the hazardous process. Some of the cytokines which have been shown to be upregulated by the resident cells include TNF IL 1 IL 2 IL 6 IL 8 IFN and monocyte chemoattractant peptide 1 MCP 1 . Platelet derived growth factor PDGF and insulin like growth factor IGF which are expressed by all cellular constituents within atherosclerotic plaques have also been shown to be overexpressed thus possibly intensifying the preexisting inflammatory reaction by a co stimulatory support in the form of a mitogenic and chemotactic factor. Recently Uyemura et al. Cross regulatory roles of IL 12 and IL 10 in atherosclerosis. J Clin Invest 1996 97 2130 2138 have elucidated type 1 T cell cytokine pattern in human atherosclerotic lesions exemplified by a strong expression of IFN but not IL 4 mRNA in comparison with normal arteries. Furthermore IL 12 a T cell growth factor produced primarily by activated monocytes and a selective inducer of Th1 cytokine pattern was found to be overexpressed within lesions as manifested by the abundance of its major heterodimer form p70 and p40 its dominant inducible protein mRNA.

Similar to the strong evidence for the dominance of the cellular immune system within the atherosclerotic plaque there is also ample data supporting the involvement of the local humoral immune system. Thus deposition of immunoglobulins and complement components have been shown in the plaques in addition to the enhanced expression of the C3b and C3Bi receptors in resident macrophages.

Valuable clues with regard to the contribution of immune mediated inflammation to the progression of atherosclerosis come from animal models. Immunocompromised mice class I MHC deficient tend to develop accelerated atherosclerosis as compared with immune competent mice. Additionally treatment of C57BL 6 mice Emeson E E Shen M L. Accelerated atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic C57BL 6 mice treated with cyclosporin A. Am J Pathol 1993 142 1906 1915 and New Zealand White rabbits Roselaar S E Schonfeld G Daugherty A. Enhanced development of atherosclerosis in cholesterol fed rabbits by suppression of cell mediated immunity. J Clin Invest 1995 96 1389 1394 with cyclosporin A a potent suppressor of IL 2 transcription resulted in a significantly enhanced atherosclerosis under normal lipoprotein burden . These latter studies may provide insight into the possible roles of the immune system in counteracting the self perpetuating inflammatory process within the atherosclerotic plaque.

Atherosclerosis is not a classical autoimmune disease although some of its manifestations such as the production of the plaque which obstructs the blood vessels may be related to aberrant immune responsiveness. In classical autoimmune disease one can often define very clearly the sensitizing autoantigen attacked by the immune system and the component s of the immune system which recognize the autoantigen humoral i.e. autoantibody or cellular i.e. lymphocytes . Above all one can show that by passive transfer of these components of the immune system the disease can be induced in healthy animals or in the case of humans the disease may be transferred from a sick pregnant mother to her offspring. Many of the above are not prevailing in atherosclerosis. In addition the disease definitely has common risk factors such as hypertension diabetes lack of physical activity smoking and others the disease affects elderly people and has a different genetic preponderance than in classical autoimmune diseases.

Treatment of autoimmune inflammatory disease may be directed towards suppression or reversal of general and or disease specific immune reactivity. Thus Aiello for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 034 102 and 6 114 395 discloses the use of estrogen like compounds for treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic lesion progression by inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment. Similarly Medford et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 846 959 disclose methods for the prevention of formation of oxidized PUFA for treatment of cardiovascular and non cardiovascular inflammatory diseases mediated by the cellular adhesion molecule VCAM 1. Furthermore Falb U.S. Pat. No. 6 156 500 designates a number of cell signaling and adhesion molecules abundant in atherosclerotic plaque and disease as potential targets of anti inflammatory therapies.

Since oxidized LDL has been clearly implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis see above the contribution of these prominent plaque components to autoimmunity in atheromatous disease processes has been investigated.

Immune responsiveness to Oxidized LDL It is known that oxidized LDL Ox LDL is chemotactic for T cells and monocytes. Ox LDL and its byproducts are also known to induce the expression of factors such as monocyte chemotactic factor 1 secretion of colony stimulating factor and platelet activating properties all of which are potent growth stimulants.

The active involvement of the cellular immune response in atherosclerosis has recently been substantiated by Stemme S. et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1995 92 3893 97 who isolated CD4 within plaques clones responding to Ox LDL as stimuli. The clones corresponding to Ox LDL 4 out of 27 produced principally interferon rather than IL 4. It remains to be seen whether the above T cell clones represent mere contact with the cellular immune system with the inciting strong immunogen Ox LDL or that this reaction provides means of combating the apparently indolent atherosclerotic process.

The data regarding the involvement of the humoral mechanisms and their meaning are much more controversial. One recent study reported increased levels of antibodies against MDA LDL a metabolite of LDL oxidation in women suffering from heart disease and or diabetes Dotevall et al. Clin Sci 2001 November 101 5 523 31 . Other investigators have demonstrated antibodies recognizing multiple epitopes on the oxidized LDL representing immune reactivity to the lipid and apolipoprotein components Steinerova A. et al. Physiol Res 2001 50 2 131 41 in atherosclerosis and other diseases such as diabetes renovascular syndrome uremia rheumatic fever and lupus erythematosus. Several reports have associated increased levels of antibodies to Ox LDL with the progression of atherosclerosis expressed by the degree of carotid stenosis severity of peripheral vascular disease etc. . Most recently Sherer et al. Cardiology 2001 95 1 20 4 demonstrated elevated levels of antibodies to cardiolipin beta 2GPI and OxLDL in coronary heart disease. Thus there seems to be a consensus as to the presence of Ox LDL antibodies in the form of immune complexes within atherosclerotic plaque although the true significance of this finding has not been established.

Antibodies to Ox LDL have been hypothesized as playing an active role in lipoprotein metabolism. Thus it is known that immune complexes of Ox LDL and its corresponding antibodies are taken up more efficiently by macrophages in suspension as compared with Ox LDL. No conclusions can be drawn from this consistent finding on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since the question of whether the accelerated uptake of Ox LDL by the macrophages is beneficial or deleterious has not yet been resolved.

Important data as to the significance of the humoral immune system in atherogenesis comes from animal models. It has been found that hyperimmunization of LDL receptor deficient rabbits with homologous oxidized LDL resulted in the production of high levels of anti Ox LDL antibodies and was associated with a significant reduction in the extent of atherosclerotic lesions as compared with a control group exposed to phosphate buffered saline PBS . A decrease in plaque formation has also been accomplished by immunization of rabbits with cholesterol rich liposomes with the concomitant production of anti cholesterol antibodies yet this effect was accompanied by a 35 reduction in very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

Thus both the pathogenic role of oxidized LDL components and their importance as autoantigens in atherosclerosis as well as other diseases have been extensively demonstrated in laboratory and clinical studies.

Recently new methods and pharmaceutical formulations have been found that are useful for treating autoimmune diseases and related T cell mediated inflammatory disorders such as allograft rejection and retroviral associated neurological disease . These treatments modulate the immune system by inducing tolerance orally or mucosally e.g. by inhalation using as tolerizers autoantigens bystander antigens or disease suppressive fragments or analogs of autoantigens or bystander antigens. Such treatments are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 935 577 to Weiner et al.. Autoantigens and bystander antigens are defined below for a general review of mucosal tolerance see Nagler Anderson C. Crit Rev Immunol 2000 20 2 103 20 . Intravenous administration of autoantigens and fragments thereof containing immunodominant epitopic regions of their molecules has been found to induce immune suppression through a mechanism called clonal anergy. Clonal anergy causes deactivation of only immune attack T cells specific to a particular antigen the result being a significant reduction in the immune response to this antigen. Thus the autoimmune response promoting T cells specific to an autoantigen once anergized no longer proliferate in response to that antigen. This reduction in proliferation also reduces the immune reactions responsible for autoimmune disease symptoms such as neural tissue damage that is observed in MS . There is also evidence that oral administration of autoantigens or immunodominant fragments in a single dose and in substantially larger amounts than those that trigger active suppression may also induce tolerance through anergy or clonal deletion .

A method of treatment has also been disclosed that proceeds by active suppression. Active suppression functions via a different mechanism from that of clonal anergy. This method discussed extensively in PCT Application PCT US93 01705 involves oral or mucosal administration of antigens specific to the tissue under autoimmune attack. These are called bystander antigens . This treatment causes regulatory suppressor T cells to be induced in the gut associated lymphoid tissue GALT or bronchial associated lymphoid tissue BALT or most generally mucosa associated lymphoid tissue MALT MALT includes GALT and BALT . These regulatory cells are released in the blood or lymphatic tissue and then migrate to the organ or tissue afflicted by the autoimmune disease and suppress autoimmune attack of the afflicted organ or tissue. The T cells elicited by the bystander antigen which recognize at least one antigenic determinant of the bystander antigen used to elicit them are targeted to the locus of autoimmune attack where they mediate the local release of certain immunomodulatory factors and cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta TGF interleukin 4 IL 4 and or interleukin 10 IL 10 . Of these TGF is an antigen nonspecific immunosuppressive factor in that it suppresses immune attack regardless of the antigen that triggers the attack. However because oral or mucosal tolerization with a bystander antigen only causes the release of TGF in the vicinity of autoimmune attack no systemic immunosuppression ensues. IL 4 and IL 10 are also antigen nonspecific immunoregulatory cytokines. IL 4 in particular enhances T helper type 2 Th response i.e. acts on T cell precursors and causes them to differentiate preferentially into Thcells at the expense of Thresponses. IL 4 also indirectly inhibits Thexacerbation. IL 10 is a direct inhibitor of Thresponses. After orally tolerizing mammals afflicted with autoimmune disease conditions with bystander antigens increased levels of TGF IL 4 and IL 10 are observed at the locus of autoimmune attack Chen Y. et al. Science 265 1237 1240 1994 . The bystander suppression mechanism has been confirmed by von Herreth et al. J. Clin. Invest. 96 1324 1331 September 1996 .

More recently oral mediated immunomodulation resulting in oral tolerance has been effectively applied in treatment of animal models of inflammatory bowel disease by feeding probiotic bacteria Dunne C et al. Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek 1999 July November 76 1 4 279 92 autoimmune glomerulonephritis by feeding glomerular basement membrane Reynolds J. et al. J Am Soc Nephrol 2001 January 12 1 61 70 experimental allergic encephalomyelitis EAE which is the equivalent of multiple sclerosis or MS by feeding myelin basic protein MBP adjuvant arthritis and collagen arthritis by feeding a subject with collagen and HSP 65 respectively. A Boston based company called Autoimmune has carried out several human experiments for preventing diabetes multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis and uveitis. The results of the human experiments have been less impressive than the non human ones however there has been some success with the prevention of arthritis.

Immunomodulation by induction of oral tolerance to autoantigens found in atherosclerotic plaque lesions has also been investigated. Study of the epitopes recognized by T cells and Ig titers in clinical and experimental models of atherosclerosis indicated three candidate antigens for suppression of inflammation in atheromatous lesions oxidized LDL the stress related heat shock protein HSP 65 and the cardiolipin binding protein beta 2GP1. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 806 400 to Shoenfeld et al. filed Sep. 30 1999 which is incorporated herein in its entirety discloses the reduction by approximately 30 of atherogenesis in the arteries of genetically susceptible LDL RD receptor deficient transgenic mice fed with oxidized human LDL. This protective effect however was achieved by feeding a crude antigen preparation consisting of centrifuged filtered and purified human serum LDL which had been subjected to a lengthy oxidation process with Cu or malondialdehyde MDA . Although significant inhibition of atherogenesis was achieved presumably via oral tolerance no identification of specific lipid antigens or immunogenic LDL components was made. Another obstacle encountered was the inherent instability of the crude oxidized LDL in vivo due to enzymatic activity and uptake of oxidized LDL by the liver and cellular immune mechanisms and its heterogeneity between different donors. It is plausible that a stable more carefully defined oxidized LDL analog would have provided immunomodulation e.g. by oral tolerance of greater efficiency.

The induction of immune tolerance and subsequent prevention or inhibition of autoimmune inflammatory processes has been demonstrated using exposure to suppressive antigens via mucosal sites other than the gut. The membranous tissue around the eyes and the mucosa of the nasal cavity as well as the gut are exposed to many invading as well as self antigens and possess mechanisms for immune reactivity. Thus Rossi et al. Scand J Immunol 1999 August 50 2 177 82 found that nasal administration of gliadin was as effective as intravenous administration in downregulating the immune response to the antigen in a mouse model of celiac disease. Similarly nasal exposure to acetylcholine receptor antigen was more effective than oral exposure in delaying and reducing muscle weakness and specific lymphocyte proliferation in a mouse model of myasthenia gravis Shi F D. et al. J Immunol 1999 May 15 162 10 5757 63 . Therefore immunogenic compounds intended for mucosal as well as intravenous or intraperitoneal administration should optimally be adaptable to nasal and other membranous routes of administration.

Thus there is clearly a need for novel well defined synthetic oxidized phospholipid derivatives and related substances exhibiting enhanced metabolic stability and efficient immunomodulation induced by e.g. oral intravenous intraperitoneal and mucosal administration.

Modification of phospholipids has been employed for a variety of applications. For example phospholipids bearing lipid soluble active compounds may be incorporated into compositions for trans dermal and trans membranal application U.S. Pat. No. 5 985 292 to Fournerou et al. and phospholipid derivatives can be incorporated into liposomes and biovectors for drug delivery see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 261 597 and 6 017 513 to Kurtz and Betbeder et al. respectively and U.S. Pat. No. 4 614 796 . U.S. Pat. No. 5 660 855 discloses lipid constructs of aminomannose derivatized cholesterol suitable for targeting smooth muscle cells or tissue formulated in liposomes. These formulations are aimed at reducing restenosis in arteries using PTCA procedures. The use of liposomes for treating atherosclerosis has been further disclosed in WO 95 23592 to Hope and Rodrigueza who teach pharmaceutical compositions of unilamellar liposomes that may contain phospholipids. The liposomes disclosed in WO 95 23592 are aimed at optimizing cholesterol efflux from atherosclerotic plaque and are typically non oxidized phospholipids.

Modified phospholipid derivatives mimicking platelet activating factor PAF structure are known to be pharmaceutically active in variety of disorders and diseases effecting such functions as vascular permeability blood pressure heart function inhibition etc. It has been suggested that one group of these derivatives may have anti cancerous activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 778 912 to Inoue at al. . U.S. Pat. No. 4 329 302 teaches synthetic phosphoglycerides compounds lysolechitin derivatives that are usable in mediating platelet activation. While the compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 329 302 are either 1 O alkyl ether or 1 O fatty acyl phosphoglycerides it was found that small chain acylation of lysolechitin gave rise to compounds with platelet activating behavior as opposed to long chain acylation and that the 1 O alkyl ether are biologically superior to the corresponding 1 O fatty acyl derivatives in mimicking PAF.

The structural effect of various phospholipids on the biological activity thereof has also been investigated by Tokumura et al. Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. July 1981 Vol. 219 No. 1 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4 827 011 to Wissner et al. with respect to hypertension.

Another group of modified phospholipid ether derivatives has been disclosed in CH Pat. No. 642 665 to Berchtold. These modified phospholipid ether derivatives were found useful in chromatographic separation but might have some physiological effect.

Oxidation of phospholipids occurs in vivo through the action of free radicals and enzymatic reactions abundant in atheromatous plaque. In vitro preparation of oxidized phospholipids usually involves simple chemical oxidation of a native LDL or LDL phospholipid component. Investigators studying the role of oxidized LDL have employed for example ferrous ions and ascorbic acid Itabe H. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1996 271 33208 217 and copper sulfate George J. et al. Atherosclerosis. 1998 138 147 152 Ameli S. et al. Arteriosclerosis Thromb Vasc Biol 1996 16 1074 79 to produce oxidized or mildly oxidized phospholipid molecules similar to those associated with plaque components. Similarly prepared molecules have been shown to be identical to auto antigens associated with atherogenesis Watson A. D. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1997 272 13597 607 and able to induce protective anti atherogenic immune tolerance U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 806 400 to Shoenfeld et al. filed Sep. 30 1999 in mice. Likewise Koike U.S. Pat. No. 5 561 052 discloses a method of producing oxidized lipids and phospholipids using copper sulfate and superoxide dismutase to produce oxidized arachidonic or linoleic acids and oxidized LDL for diagnostic use. Davies et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2001 276 16015 teach the use of oxidized phospholipids as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor agonists.

1 Palmitoyl 2 5 oxovaleroyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine POVPC see Example I for a 2 D structural description and derivatives thereof such as 1 palmitoyl 2 glutaroyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine PGPC are representative examples of oxidized esterified phospholipids that have been studied with respect to atherogenesis see for example Boullier et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2000 275 9163 Subbanagounder et al. Circulation Research 1999 pp. 311 . The effect of different structural analogs that belong to this class of oxidized phospholipids has also been studied see for example Subbanagounder et al. Arterioscler. Thromb. Nasc. Biol. 2000 pp. 2248 Leitinger et al. Proc. Nat. Ac. Sci. 1999 96 12010 .

However in vivo applications employing oxidized phospholipids prepared as above have the disadvantage of susceptibility to recognition binding and metabolism of the active component in the body making dosage and stability after administration an important consideration.

Furthermore the oxidation techniques employed are non specific yielding a variety of oxidized products necessitating either further purification or use of impure antigenic compounds. This is of even greater concern with native LDL even if purified.

Thus there is a widely recognized need for and it would be highly advantageous to have a novel synthetic oxidized phospholipid improved methods of synthesizing same and uses thereof as immunomodulators devoid of the above limitations.

Experimental and clinical evidence indicates a causative role for oxidized LDL ox LDL and LDL components in the etiology of an excessive inflammatory response in atherosclerosis. Both cellular and humoral immune reactivity to plaque related oxidized LDL have been demonstrated suggesting an important anti oxidized LDL autoimmune component in atherogenesis. Thus LDL oxidized LDL and components thereof have been the targets of numerous therapies for prevention and treatment of heart disease cerebral vascular disease and peripheral vascular disease.

Prior art studies associated with the role of oxidized LDL and components thereof in reducing the immune response to endogenous e.g. plaque related oxidized LDL employed either a crude antigen preparation consisting of centrifuged filtered and purified human serum LDL which had been subjected to a lengthy oxidation process with Cu or MDA or synthetically prepared oxidized LDL analogs. Since phospholipids are considered as active LDL components studies with synthetically prepared oxidized LDL analogs typically involved oxidized phospholipids e.g. POVPC and PGPC .

Although the prior art teaches that oral administration of oxidized LDL can result in 30 reduction in atherogenesis thus suggesting a protective effect of oxidized LDL presumably via oral tolerance no identification of specific lipid antigens or immunogenic LDL components was made. Another obstacle encountered by these prior art studies was the inherent instability of the crude oxidized LDL in vivo due to enzymatic activity and uptake of oxidized LDL by the liver and cellular immune mechanisms. Such an inherent instability is also associated with in vivo applications that utilize synthetic oxidized LDL derivatives such as POVPC and PGPC described hereinabove .

Hence hitherto no direct correlation between exogenous oxidized LDL or components thereof and endogenous oxidized LDL in terms of immunomodulation has been established. Oxidized LDL analogs devoid of the inherent instability and other limitations involved with the administration of oxidized LDL which can modulate the immune and or inflammatory response associated with endogenous oxidized LDL and other endogenous oxidized lipids have not been uncovered so far as well.

While conceiving the present invention it was hypothesized that synthetically defined oxidized lipids in general and oxidized LDL analogs in particular could modulate the immune reactivity to endogenous oxidized lipids in general and oxidized LDL in particular and thus be used in the treatment or prevention of a myriad of diseases and disorders associated with inflammation and or altered immune response such as for example atherosclerosis and related diseases or disorders as well as other diseases and disorder associated with endogenous oxidized lipid.

Inflammation involved in atherogenesis often leads to complications such as plaque rupture and thrombosis Libby et al. Inflammation and atherosclerosis. Circulation. 2002 105 1135 1143 .

The presence of activated T lymphocytes in human atherosclerotic lesion may imply their involvement in the disease initiation and progression Ross R. Atherosclerosis an inflammatory disease. NEJM. 1999 340 115 126 . The major class of T lymphocytes CD4 can differentiate into the lineages Th1 or Th2 which are functionally defined by the produced cytokine interferon IFN secreted from the Th1 cells and interleukin IL 4 secreted from the Th2 cells. Among the principle inducers of the Th1 and Th2 cells are IL 12 and IL 10 respectively Daugherty A and Rateri D L T lymphocytes in atherosclerosis the Yin Yang of Th1 and Th2 Influence on lesion formation Circ Res. 2002 90 1039 1040 Hansson G K Vaccination against atherosclerosis science or fiction. Circulation. 2002 106 1599 1601 .

T lymphocytes isolated from whole blood in patients with acute coronary syndromes or harvested from human carotid plaques have been shown to specifically recognize Ox LDL and proliferate when exposed to Ox LDL Hansson G K. Immune mechanisms in atherosclerosis. Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 2001 21 1 876 90 . Ox LDL and oxidized lipid byproducts thereof e.g. oxidized phospholipids are present within atherosclerotic plaques Witztum 2001 supra .

Hence while oxidative modification of LDL can be a prerequisite for rapid accumulation of LDL in macrophages and foam cell formation it can further induce immunogenic epitopes in the LDL molecule which lead to formation of antibodies against Ox LDL.

Oxidized LDL epitopes therefore serve as important ligands mediating the binding and clearance of oxidatively damaged lipoprotein particles and apoptotic cells and inducing an innate immune response which effects their removal. On the other hand the oxidized LDL epitopes can play a role in the immune activation that characterizes the progressive atherosclerotic plaque.

In view of the above the present inventors postulated that compounds which can serve as oxidized LDL epitopes may modulate the immune response so as to induce a beneficial rather than deleterious effect on atherogenesis. In other words it was postulated that administering preferably orally oxidized LDL analogs such as oxidized phospholipids would induce tolerance to the endogenous oxidized LDL formed during atherogenesis and would thus reduce the inflammatory response thereto and attenuate atherogenesis progression.

Evidence supporting immunomodulation as a new therapeutic approach to treat atherosclerosis has recently been published Nicoletti et al. Induction of neonatal tolerance to oxidized lipoprotein reduces atherosclerosis in Apo E knockout Apo E KO mice. Mol. Med. 2000 6 4 283 290 . It was shown that intraperitoneal injection of oxidized LDL to Apo E KO mice at birth induced T cell tolerance due to clonal deletion reduced the immune response to oxidized LDL and as a result reduced susceptibility to atherosclerosis.

Adaptive and innate immunity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as well as in many other disease and disorders. Given their abundance in the lesion lipids are possible targets of the atherosclerosis associated immune response. Recently it has been shown that natural killer T NKT cells can recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1 molecules. CD1 molecules present lipid antigens to T cells unlike the evolutionarily related major histocompatibility complex MHC class I and II molecules which display peptide antigens. Like MHC class I molecules however CD1 molecules consist of a heavy chain associated with the microglobulin M light chain. Crystal structures of two CD1 isoforms human CD1b and mouse CD1d show an overall domain organization that resembles MHC class I molecules. Notably the antigen binding site in CD1 is hydrophobic forming channels CD1b or pockets mouse CD1d that can accommodate hydrocarbon chains of lipids. A narrow opening between the helices permits the display of polar moieties of the lipid in a region accessible for recognition by T cell receptors TCRs . This system facilitates the binding of different lipid molecules linked to diverse polar head groups thereby creating an enormous pool of potential CD1 presented antigens Zeng et al. Crystal structure of mouse CD1 an MHC like fold with a large hydrophobic binding groove. Science 1997 277 339 345 .

CD1 molecules bind foreign lipid antigens as they survey the endosomal compartments of infected antigen presenting cells. Unlike T cells that recognize CD1 restricted foreign lipids CD1 restricted T cells that are self antigen reactive function as auto effectors that are rapidly stimulated to carry out helper and effector functions upon interaction with CD1 expressing antigen presenting cells. The functional distinctions between subsets of CD1 restricted T cells and the pathways by which these cells both influence the inflammatory and tolerogenic effects of dendritic cells and activate natural killer cells and other lymphocytes provide insight into how CD1 restricted T cells regulate antimicrobial responses antitumor immunity and the balance between tolerance and autoimmunity Vincent et al. Understanding the function of CD1 restricted T cells. Nat Immunol. 2003 4 517 23 .

Tupin et al. CD1d dependent Activation of NKT Cells Aggravates Atherosclerosis. J Exp Med. 2004 199 417 22 have explored the role of CD1d restricted NKT cells in atherosclerosis by using apolipoprotein E deficient apoE mice and ApoE mice crossed with CD1d CD1d apoE mice that exhibited a 25 decrease in lesion size compared with apoE mice. Administration of alpha galactosylceramide a synthetic glycolipid that activates NKT cells via CD1d induced a 50 increase in lesion size in apoE mice whereas it did not affect lesion size in apoE CD1d mice. These results show that activation of CD1d restricted NKT cells exacerbates atherosclerosis. Zhou et al. Editing of CD1d bound lipid antigens by endosomal lipid transfer proteins. Science. 2004 303 523 7 have reported that mice deficient in prosaposin the precursor to a family of endosomal lipid transfer proteins LTP exhibit specific defects in CD1d mediated antigen presentation and lack V 14 NKT cells. In vitro saposins extracted monomeric lipids from membranes and from CD1 thereby promoting the loading as well as the editing of lipids on CD1. Transient complexes between CD1 lipid and LTP suggested a tug of war model in which lipid exchange between CD1 and LTP is on the basis of their respective affinities for lipids. LTPs constitute a previously unknown link between lipid metabolism and immunity and are likely to exert a profound influence on the repertoire of self tumor and microbial lipid antigens.

Type 2 activation of macrophages M2 is an alternative pathway to the classic macrophage activation. These M2 cells are APC s that are presented in the Lamina Propria of the gut as part of the gut associated immune system. These M2 cells will response with IL 10 expression instead of the classic Th1 cytokine response of macrophages as describe below.

Activated macrophages are used as antigen presenting cells APCs . Antigen recognition by T cells is the key event controlling the adaptive immune response.

The classical pathway of IFN dependent activation of macrophages by Th1 type responses is a well established feature of cellular immunity. Macrophage activation depends on the products of specifically activated T helper Th1 type lymphocytes and natural killer cells in particular IFN and cytokine network involving IL 12 and IL 18 which are produced by APCs. The concept of an alternative pathway of macrophage activation by the Th2 type cytokines IL4 and IL 13 together with IL 10 has gained credence in the past decade to account for a distinctive macrophages phenotype that is consistent with a different role in humoral immunity and repair.

IL 4 and IL 13 up regulates expression of the mannose receptor and MHC class II molecules by macrophages which stimulate endocytosis and antigen presentation.

Immunoglobulins and immune complexes can bind both activating and inhibitory receptors for Fc and for complement. Also Fc receptor ligation induces marked effects on the release of cytokines such as IL 12 IL 10 and IL 4 by APCs themselves and by other cells of the innate and acquired immune systems Gordon S. Alternative Activation of Macrophages. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 3 23 34 2003 .

Macrophages challenged with inflammatory stimuli IFN for example and introduced to immune complexes dramatically opposed in their action instead of a Th1 response elevated levels of IL 12 and moderate levels of IL 10 there is a dramatic decrease in IL 12 and an increase in IL 10 levels. IL 10 exerts immune suppressive effects on macrophages. Anderson C. F. and Mosser D. M. A Novel Phenotype for an Activated Macrophages the Type 2 Activated Macrophage. J. Leukoc. Biol. 72 101 106 2002 . IL 10 acts on a distinct plasma membrane receptor to those for IL 4 and IL 13 and its effect on macrophage gene expression are different involving a more profound inhibition of a range of antigen presenting and effector functions together with the activation of selected genes or functions Gordon S. Alternative Activation of Macrophages. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 3 23 34 2003 . 

Hence in addition to its effect on atherosclerosis and other diseases which are directly associated with oxidized LDL it was further postulated that the immunomodulation and the anti inflammatory effect induced by oxidized LDL synthetic analogs can be utilized in the treatment and prevention of other disease and disorders directly or indirectly associated with endogenous oxidized LDL and other oxidized lipids. This was supported by several studies which were directed at immunotherapy of human autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis RA type I diabetes and multiple sclerosis either by modulation of individual immune pathways involved in inflammation or by tolerization to various antigens Bielekova et al. Encephalitogenic potential of the myelin basic protein peptide amino acids 83 99 in multiple sclerosis Results of a phase II clinical trial with an altered peptide ligand. Nat Med. 2000 6 1167 1175 Kappos et al. Induction of a non encephalitogenic type 2 T helper cell autoimmune response in multiple sclerosis after administration of an altered peptide ligand in a placebo controlled randomized phase II trial. Nat. Med. 2000 6 1176 1182 .

Hence there are ample data supporting the relation between lipids inflammation and the immune system indicating a direct linkage therebetween.

In an attempt to improve treatment of inflammation and diseases and disorders associated with oxidized lipids the present inventors have designed novel synthetic oxidized phospholipids and structurally related compounds which are devoid of the limitations associated oxidized LDL and other known oxidized phospholipids and lipids as delineated hereinabove .

As is demonstrated in the Examples section that follows while reducing the present invention to practice it was indeed confirmed that oral and or mucosal administration of the newly designed oxidized LDL analogs modulate the immune and or inflammatory response to endogenous oxidized LDL thereby reducing the inflammatory response in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. These results clearly demonstrate the effect of exogenous oxidized lipids on inflammatory and immune processes which involve endogenous oxidized lipids.

Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there are provided novel compounds designed so as to mimic the immunomodulation effect induced by oxidized LDL and or an inflammation associated with oxidized LDL and or other oxidized lipids while avoiding the limitations associated with oxidized LDL and other oxidized lipids and are thus highly suitable for oral mucosal treatment of inflammatory associated diseases and disorders which involve oxidized lipids.

Since oxidized phospholipids are known as active components of ox LDL and further since biological membranes typically include phospholipids and mainly phosphoglycerides the compounds according to the present invention are structurally based on oxidized phospholipids in general and oxidized phosphoglycerides in particular.

Hydrocarbon chains that terminate with the oxidized group Z are typically lower sized chains preferably having between 3 and 10 carbon atoms more preferably between 3 and 6 carbon atoms not including the carbon atom in the oxidized group.

LDL is a lipoprotein composed of functionally different moieties components . Among these moieties are phospholipids which are considered to play an important role in the effect of oxidized LDL on plaque related diseases.

As used herein throughout the term moiety or component refers to a major portion of a functional molecule which is linked to another molecule while retaining its activity. Phospholipids are natural substances that include a non polar lipid group and a highly polar phosphatidyl group at the end. The most prevalent phospholipids in nature are phosphoglycerides which include a glycerol backbone and fatty acyl moieties attached thereto. Phosphoglycerides such as 1 2 O fatty acyl phosphoglycerides as well as oxidative modifications thereof such as POVPC and PGPC have been involved in atherogenesis related studies as is described in detail hereinabove.

In addition to LDL phospholipids and phosphoglycerides other lipids are involved in various biological processes such as inflammation. These include for example sphingolipids glycolipids and other membrane lipids.

The compounds of the present invention described above have been primarily designed according to the basic structure of phosphoglycerides such that in a preferred embodiment of the present invention n in the general formula I above equals 3. Such compounds are referred to herein as oxidized phosphoglyceride analogs while the compounds of the present invention are collectively referred to herein as oxidized lipids and include analogs and derivatives thereof.

As used herein throughout the term analogs refers to compounds that are structurally related to the subject molecule e.g. oxidized phospholipids oxidized LDL etc. and can therefore exert the same biological activity.

The term derivatives refers to subject molecules which has been chemically modified but retain a major portion thereof unchanged e.g. subject molecules which are substituted by additional or different substituents subject molecules in which a portion thereof has been oxidized or hydrolysed and the like.

In view of the inherent instability of the O fatty acyl moiety in naturally occurring phosphoglycerides as well as in other structurally related compounds which results from its high susceptibility to fast hydrolysis in biological systems by phospholipase A see for example A Textbook of Drug Design and Development Povl Krogsgaard Larsen and Hans Bundgaard eds. Harwood Academic Publishers chapter 13 pages 478 480 the compounds of the present invention have been designed to include at least one O fatty ether moiety such that in the general formula I above when n equals 3 at least one of Aand Ais preferably a CR R group. Compounds in which one of Aand Ais a CR R group are referred to herein as mono etherified phosphoglyceride analogs while compounds in which both Aand Aare CR R are referred to herein as di etherified phosphoglyceride analogs and are characterized by improved in vivo stability particularly as compared with the presently known synthetic oxidized phosphoglycerides e.g. POVPC and PGPC .

As is defined under the general formula I above when n equals 3 at least one of Xand Xis a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with an oxidized group such that Z is not hydrogen. However since in naturally occurring oxidized LDL derivatives the oxidized alkyl chain is typically located at the second position and since it has been demonstrated that the biological activity of several phospholipids directly depends on the structure thereof see the Background section for a detailed discussion in another preferred embodiment of the present invention Xis a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with an oxidized group.

One example of a novel etherified oxidized phosphoglyceride according to the present invention is 2 5 Aldehyde Lecithin Ether ALLE 1 hexadecyl 2 5 oxo pentanyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine D ALLE 3 hexadecyl 2 5 oxo pentanyl sn glycero 1 phosphocholine L ALLE and the racemic mixture thereof the synthesis and use of which are further detailed in the Examples section which follows.

However as aldehydes are known as unstable compounds which tend to be easily oxidized preferred examples of novel etherified oxidized phosphoglycerides according to the present invention include the acid derivative 1 Hexadecyl 2 5 Carboxy butyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine also referred to hereinafter as IC 201 and its corresponding acetals 1 Hexadecyl 2 5 5 Dimethoxy pentyloxy sn glycero 3 phosphocholine and 1 Hexadecyl 2 5 5 Diethoxy pentyloxy sn glycero 3 phosphocholine see for 2 D structural formulas the synthesis and use of which are also further detailed in the Examples section which follows.

While the oxidized lipids described above are derived from phosphoglycerides oxidized lipids derived from for example sphingolipids are also within the scope of the present invention. Such oxidized sphingolipids analogs according to the present invention have the general formula I above wherein n equals 3 Y is hydrogen Bis NH and Ais C O whereby the hydrocarbon chain terminating with an oxidized group is attached either to the amide as Xor to C.

While oxidized phosphoglycerides are derived from glycerol which is a monosaccharide molecule and oxidized sphingolipids are derived from sphingosine an amino alcohol it is envisioned that oxidized phospholipids derived from other biologically prevalent alcohol base units would exert the same effect. Furthermore since no correlation between the distance of the oxidized moiety and the phosphatidyl moiety in oxidized phospholipids has been established it is envisioned that oxidized lipids that are derived from a 4 6 carbon atoms backbone would retain structure characteristics similar to those of oxidized phosphoglycerides and as such in all probability would possess the same antigenicity and immune modulation activity and employed and applied similarly to the oxidized phosphoglyceride derivatives described herein.

A preferred example of such an alcohol base unit is a monosaccharide base unit such as for example glucose erythritol and threitol.

Thus in another preferred embodiment the compounds according to the present invention include up to 6 carbon atoms in the backbone chain. The carbon atoms in the backbone chain can be linearly attached one to another so as to form an open chain monosaccharide backbone or alternatively can form a heteroalicyclic monosaccharide backbone namely a pyranose or furanose backbone such that in the general formula above one of Rand R is covalently attached to one of Rn or R n via an etheric bond an R O R bond Still alternatively the compounds of the present invention can include 4 6 carbon atoms in the backbone chain which form a non saccharidic ring namely a four five or six membered carbocyclic or heteroalicyclic ring such that in the general formula I above one of Rand R is covalently attached to one of Rn or R n via different bonds e.g. a sigma bond a bond a carboxylic bond an ether bond a thioether bond and any other bond .

As is further described in the general formula I hereinabove Y is either a phosphoryl moiety e.g. phosphoryl choline phosphoryl ethanolamine etc. or a non phosphoryl moiety e.g. hydrogen acyl or alkyl . When Y is a non phosphoryl moiety the resultant compound is not a phospholipid rather a diglyceride compound for n 3 or any other alcohol derived e.g. monosaccharide derived compound.

Since no particular activity of the phosphoryl group has been taught so far with respect to the immunomodulation activity of oxidized LDL it is further envisioned that such non phosphoryl compounds would retain similar structure characteristics as the above oxidized phospholipids and as such in all probability would posses antigenicity and immune modulation activity and can be employed and applied similarly to the oxidized phospholipid derivatives described herein.

In an embodiment of the present invention Y is a saccharide as is defined hereinabove and thus the compound according to the present invention is an oxidized analog of glycolipids.

The preferred structural features described above with respect to oxidized phosphoglycerides apply for all the compounds described hereinabove. Hence in a preferred embodiment of the present invention at least one of A A . . . and An 1 is a CR R group such that the compound include at least one etherified side chain. Due to the instability of an O acyl side chain it is further preferred that at least one of the oxidized groups in X Xn 1 would be linked to such an etherified side chain.

Although naturally occurring phospholipids and oxidized phospholipids typically include O acyl chains there is evidence that thiol derivatives of oxidized phospholipids which include for example S acyl chains may exert the same biological activity see for example Reddy et al. Antitumor ether lipids an improved synthesis of ilmofosine and an entioselective synthesis of an ilmofosine analog. Tetrahedron Letters. 1994 17 2679 2682 Batia and Hajdu. Stereospecific synthesis of ether and thioether phospholipids. The use of L glyceric acid as a chiral phospholipids precursor. J. Org. Chem. 1988 53 5034 5039 Bosies et al. Lipids. 1987 22 947 Bosies et al. Ger. Offen. DE 3 906 952 C.A. 1991 114 102394w and Herrmann et al. NCI EORTC Symposium on New Drugs in Cancer Therapy Amsterdam March 1992 . As thiols are characterized by enhanced biostability such compounds can further be highly beneficial.

Hence in one embodiment of the present invention at least one of B Bn is sulfur such that at least one of the side chains is a thiolated S acyl or an s alkyl chain. In another embodiment at least one of X Xn 1 which comprises an oxidized group is linked to such a thiolated side chain.

Alternatively each of B Bn can be a biocompatible heteroatom other than oxygen and sulfur such as for example nitrogen phosphor or silicon as is described within the general formula I hereinabove.

Apart from the structural features delineated herein the compounds of the present invention can be further substituted at any position thereof e.g. at any of the side chain carbon atoms and at any of the backbone carbon atoms. While a myriad of possible substituents delineated hereinabove and encompassed by the present invention preferred substituents include for example halo and aryl.

Although the compounds of the present invention have been basically designed from oxidized phospholipids such as phosphoglycerides the present inventors also envisage that a single oxidized hydrocarbon chain which is optionally attached to a polar group would exert that same antigenicity and immunomodulation activity as the oxidized phospholipid analogs described above.

Such an oxidized hydrocarbon chain is a common feature of arachidonic acid metabolites. Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid having 20 carbon atoms which is produced in vivo by the enzymatic hydrolysis of phospholipids containing same. Upon its release arachidonic acid is oxidized into a number of important autacoids by certain lipoxygenases and following a cascade of additional enzymatic reactions the autacoids are metabolized into a family of classical prostaglandins PG prostacyclin PGI and thromboxane TX A which are active in many biological pathways. All these metabolites include a common feature of a six carbon chain terminating with an oxidizable double bond.

As is described hereinabove and is further demonstrated in the Examples section that follows the presence of an oxidized group in oxidized LDL analogs that are designed for mimicking the immunomodulation induced by ox LDL is essential. Thus in comparative studies it was shown for example that Compound V the non oxidized compound corresponding to CI 201 Compound VII is non active while CI 201 is see for example Examples XIV and XV in the Examples section that follows . Furthermore based on the metabolism pathway of arachidonic acid it is assumed that other oxidized phospholipids undergo the same pathway which results in the release of the oxidized side chain. As is further described hereinabove the oxidized side chain preferably includes between 3 and 7 carbon atoms and is therefore similar to the six carbon chain feature on the arachidonic acid metabolites. Moreover the CD1 mechanism described above which suggest a role for lipids in the immune system indicate that the hydrophilic head i.e. the carbon C2 and or the carbon C3 head group in CD1 d are most probably the antigenic epitope presented to the immune system as it is the part presenting by the CD1 groove that hide the hydrophobic part of the molecule indicating a role of an hydrophilic epitope at carbon C2.

In oxidized phospholipids such as phosphoglycerides the oxidized side chain is attached to a phosphoglycerol backbone. However as is mentioned hereinabove no particular role for the phosphoglycerol backbone has been suggested.

Hence in a preferred embodiment of the present invention n equals 1 such that the compound of the present invention is a single hydrocarbon chain terminating with an oxidized group. While such an oxidized single hydrocarbon chain is non polar it can be attached to a polar group such as a phosphoryl group such that in the general formula I hereinabove when n equals 1 at least one of Rand R is a phosphate or phosphonate group. Alternatively at least one of Rand R can be selected from other biocompatible polar groups such as for example peptides saccharides and the like.

Depending on the substituents each of the carbon atoms in each of the compounds described above namely C Cn and Ca Cm can be chiral or non chiral. Any chiral carbon atom that is present in the compounds of the present invention can be either in an R configuration an S configuration or racemic. Thus the present invention encompasses any combination of chiral and racemic carbon atoms including all the possible stereoisomers optical isomers enantiomers and anomers. As is demonstrated in the Examples section that follows the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized while retaining a configuration of the starting material. The compounds of the present invention can be further selectively synthesized in terms of the stereochemistry of the oxidized group. Hence by selecting the appropriate starting materials and the appropriate syntheses conditions the optical purity e.g. the inclusion of chiral and or racemic carbons and the obtained stereoisomers of the resulting compounds can be determined. In cases where racemic mixtures are obtained known techniques can be used to separate the optical or stereo isomers. Such techniques are described for example in Organic chemistry fourth Edition by Paula Yurkanis Bruice page 180 185 and page 214 Prentice Hall Upper Sadde River N.J. 07458 .

The present invention further encompasses any pharmaceutically acceptable salts prodrugs hydrates and solvates of the compounds described hereinabove.

The term prodrug refers to an agent which is converted into the active compound the active parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are typically useful for facilitating the administration of the parent drug. They may for instance be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility as compared with the parent drug in pharmaceutical compositions. Prodrugs are also often used to achieve a sustained release of the active compound in vivo. An example without limitation of a prodrug would be a compound of the present invention having one or more carboxylic acid moieties which is administered as an ester the prodrug . Such a prodrug is hydrolysed in vivo to thereby provide the free compound the parent drug . The selected ester may affect both the solubility characteristics and the hydrolysis rate of the prodrug.

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to a charged species of the parent compound and its counter ion which is typically used to modify the solubility characteristics of the parent compound and or to reduce any significant irritation to an organism by the parent compound while not abrogating the biological activity and properties of the administered compound. An example without limitation of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt would be a carboxylate anion and a cation such as but not limited to ammonium sodium potassium and the like.

The term solvate refers to a complex of variable stoichiometry e.g. di tri tetra penta hexa and so on which is formed by a solute the compound of present invention and a solvent whereby the solvent does not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Suitable solvents include for example ethanol acetic acid and the like.

As is detailed hereinbelow the newly designed compounds of the present invention exert a highly beneficial immunomodulation activity and therefore can be utilized in various therapeutic applications. Utilizing these compounds in therapeutic application involves administration thereof either per se or as a part of a pharmaceutical composition where it is mixed with suitable carriers or excipients.

Optionally the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the active ingredients to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.

Alternatively the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle e.g. sterile pyrogen free water based solution before use.

The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas using e.g. conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.

Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in context of the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. More specifically a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of active ingredients effective to prevent alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of a disorder e.g. atherosclerosis or prolong the survival of the subject being treated.

Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.

For any preparation used in the methods of the invention the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from in vitro and cell culture assays. For example a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a desired concentration or titer. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.

Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the active ingredients described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in vitro in cell cultures or experimental animals. The data obtained from these in vitro and cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient s condition. See e.g. Fingl et al. 1975 in The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Ch. 1 p. 1 .

Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma or brain levels of the active ingredient are sufficient to induce or suppress angiogenesis minimal effective concentration MEC . The MEC will vary for each preparation but can be estimated from in vitro data. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. Detection assays can be used to determine plasma concentrations.

Depending on the severity and responsiveness of the condition to be treated dosing can be of a single or a plurality of administrations with course of treatment lasting from several days to several weeks or until cure is effected or diminution of the disease state is achieved.

The amount of a composition to be administered will of course be dependent on the subject being treated the severity of the affliction the manner of administration the judgment of the prescribing physician etc.

Compositions of the present invention may if desired be presented in a pack or dispenser device such as an FDA approved kit which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. The pack or dispenser may also be accommodated by a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture use or sale of pharmaceuticals which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the compositions or human or veterinary administration. Such notice for example may be of labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs or of an approved product insert. Compositions comprising a preparation of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared placed in an appropriate container and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition as is further detailed hereinbelow.

Thus in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the pharmaceutical composition is packaged in a packaging material and identified in print on or in the packaging material for use in the treatment or prevention of an inflammation associated with an endogenous oxidized lipid. A list of representative examples of diseases and disorders associated with such an inflammation is provided hereinbelow.

As is further described in detail hereinbelow the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can further include an additional compound which is useful in the treatment or prevention of the above inflammation.

As is described in detail in the Examples section that follows representative examples of the newly designed compounds of the present invention have been found effective in modulating an immune response and or an inflammatory response associated with endogenous oxidized LDL thus leading to attenuation of diseases associated with endogenous oxidized LDL. These results clearly suggest that i modulation of an immune and or inflammatory response to endogenous oxidized LDL in particular and endogenous oxidized lipids in general can be induced by any compound that is structurally related to an oxidized lipid and ii compounds capable of modulating an immune and or inflammatory response to oxidized lipids can be utilized to treat or prevent inflammation associated with endogenous oxidized lipids.

Hence according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating or preventing an inflammation associated with an endogenous oxidized lipid. The method according to this aspect of the present invention is effected by administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of one or more oxidized lipids.

As used herein the phrase an endogenous oxidized lipid refers to one or more oxidized lipids that are present or formed in vivo as a result of inflammatory and other cell or humoral mediated processes.

The term method refers to manners means techniques and procedures for accomplishing a given task including but not limited to those manners means techniques and procedures either known to or readily developed from known manners means techniques and procedures by practitioners of the chemical pharmacological biological biochemical and medical arts.

As used herein the phrase treating or preventing includes abrogating substantially inhibiting slowing or reversing the progression of a disease substantially ameliorating clinical symptoms of a disease or substantially preventing the appearance of clinical symptoms of a disease.

Examples of subjects suitable for such treatment include subjects suffering from a disease or disorder associated with an inflammation as is detailed hereinbelow. Preferred individual subjects according to the present invention are mammals such as canines felines ovines porcines equines and bovines. Preferably the individual subjects according to the present invention are humans.

The phrase oxidized lipid refers to a natural or preferably synthetically prepared compound that has common structural features with a natural lipid an oxidized lipid and any components moieties analogs and derivatives thereof. For example oxidized LDL is composed of several functionally and structurally different moieties and this phrase encompasses any synthetically prepared compound that has common structural features with any one of these moieties. This phrase further encompasses any derivative of such analogs.

Representative examples of oxidized lipids include without limitation oxidized phospholipids platelet activating factor analogs plasmalogen analogs substituted or unsubstituted 3 30 carbon atoms hydrocarbons terminating with an oxidized group sphingolipids oxidized analogs glycolipids oxidized analogs oxidized analogs of membrane lipids and any analogs or derivatives thereof.

Phospholipids in general and phosphoglycerides in particular are well known lipids which are also components of oxidized LDL. Phosphoglycerides are derivatives of phsophoglycerol which include one or more fatty acyl or acyl groups attached to the phsophoglycerol backbone.

Hence synthetically prepared oxidized phospholipids may be efficiently used in the method according to this aspect of the present invention. Representative examples of known synthetic oxidized phospholipids include without limitation 1 palmitoyl 2 azelaoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 hexadecyl 2 azelaoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 palmitoyl 2 glutaroyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine PGPC 1 palmitoyl 2 5 oxovaleroyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine POVPC and 1 palmitoyl 2 9 oxononanoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine.

More preferred examples of synthetic oxidized phospholipids include the compounds of the present invention as described hereinabove including those compounds in which n 1. The latter are delineated herein as substituted or unsubstituted 3 30 carbon atoms hydrocarbons terminating with an oxidized group.

Other compounds which are structurally related to oxidized phosphoglycerides and can therefore be efficiently used in this and other aspects of the present invention are platelet activating factor PAF analogs.

PAF are 1 alkyl 2 acetyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholines naturally occurring ether linked glycerolipids. The alkyl chain at the sn 1 position is typically an unsaturated alkyl having 16 18 carbon atoms. Some well known PAF analogs typically include substitution of the acyl moiety at the sn 2 position by a long chain acyl moiety e.g. a fatty acid acyl . Additional PAF analogs include an oxidative modification either at the unsaturated O alkyl chain present in the sn 1 position or at the fatty acyl chain present at the sn 2 position.

Representative examples of known PAF analogs that can be used in this context of the present invention include without limitation 1 palmitoyl 2 9 oxononanoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 hexadecyl 2 acetoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 octadecyl 2 acetoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 hexadecyl 2 butyroyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 octadecyl 2 butyroyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 palmitoyl 2 acetoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 octadecenyl 2 acetoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 hexadecyl 2 homogammalinolenoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 hexadecyl 2 arachidonoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 hexadecyl 2 eicosapentaenoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 hexadecyl 2 docosahexaenoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 octadecyl 2 methyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 hexadecyl 2 butenoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine Lyso PAF C16 and Lyso PAF C18. However any other PAF analogs or derivatives thereof can further be used in this context of the present invention.

Additional compounds which are structurally related to oxidized phosphoglycerides and can therefore be efficiently used in this and other aspects of the present invention are plasmalogen analogs.

Plasmalogens are 1 alkyl 2 acetyl sn glycero 3 phosphatidyl naturally occurring ether linked glycerolipids in which the alkyl chain at the sn 1 position is typically saturated. Some well known plasmalogen analogs typically include substitution of the acyl moiety at the sn 2 position by a long chain acyl moiety e.g. a fatty acid acyl and further include an oxidative modification either at the sn 1 position or at the sn 2 position.

Representative examples of known plasmalogen analogs that can be used in this context of the present invention include without limitation 1 O 1 Z hexadecenyl 2 12 7 nitro 2 1 3 benzoxadiazol 4 yl amino dodecanoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 O 1 Z hexadecenyl 2 oleoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 O 1 Z hexadecenyl 2 arachidonoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 O 1 Z hexadecenyl 2 docosahexaenoyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine 1 O 1 Z hexadecenyl 2 oleoyl sn glycero 3 phosphoethanolamine 1 O 1 Z hexadecenyl 2 arachidonoyl sn glycero 3 phosphoethanolamine and 1 O 1 Z hexadecenyl 2 docosahexaenoyl sn glycero 3 phosphoethanolamine. However any other plasmalogen analogs or derivatives thereof can further be used in this context of the present invention.

As used herein the phrase an inflammation associated with an endogenous oxidized lipid describes an inflammation that is associated with the in vivo formation or presence of one or more oxidized lipids e.g. oxidized LDL oxidized membrane lipids etc. .

Inflammation is a protective response of the body to an injury. Several cytokines play key roles in mediating inflammatory reactions amongst are IFN and IL 10. IFN has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions. On the other hand IL 10 inhibits IFN production by activated immune cells such as TH2 and M2 cells this cytokine IL 10 serve as the major anti inflammatory gate .

Excessive inflammation is oftentimes deleterious involving or leading to a myriad of diseases and disorders. As is explained in detail hereinabove excessive inflammatory response is typically associated with oxidized lipid epitopes.

As is shown in the Examples section that follows modulating the immune response to oxidized LDL by synthetic oxidized LDL analogs is associated with an anti inflammatory effect. This anti inflammatory effect may be utilized in treating or preventing inflammation associated disease or disorders in which endogenous oxidized LDL or any other endogenous oxidized lipid is implicated. Such diseases and disorders include for example diseases or disorders associated with plaque formation including but not limited to atherosclerosis atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease cerebrovascular disease peripheral vascular disease stenosis restenosis and in stent stenosis as well as autoimmune diseases or disorders neurodegenerative diseases or disorders proliferative disease or disorders and aging processes.

Thus representative examples of diseases or disorders associated with an inflammation which in turn is associated with an endogenous oxidized lipids and are therefore treatable by the method of the present invention include for example idiopathic inflammatory diseases or disorders chronic inflammatory diseases or disorders acute inflammatory diseases or disorders autoimmune diseases or disorders infectious diseases or disorders inflammatory malignant diseases or disorders inflammatory transplantation related diseases or disorders inflammatory degenerative diseases or disorders diseases or disorders associated with a hypersensitivity inflammatory cardiovascular diseases or disorders inflammatory cerebrovascular diseases or disorders peripheral vascular diseases or disorders inflammatory glandular diseases or disorders inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases or disorders inflammatory cutaneous diseases or disorders inflammatory hepatic diseases or disorders inflammatory neurological diseases or disorders inflammatory musculo skeletal diseases or disorders inflammatory renal diseases or disorders inflammatory reproductive diseases or disorders inflammatory systemic diseases or disorders inflammatory connective tissue diseases or disorders inflammatory tumors necrosis inflammatory implant related diseases or disorders inflammatory aging processes immunodeficiency diseases or disorders proliferative diseases and disorders and inflammatory pulmonary diseases or disorders as is detailed hereinbelow.

HMGCoA reductase inhibitors statins are well known drugs that effectively reduce LDL cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme that regulates the rate of cholesterol production and increasing the clearance of LDL cholesterol present in the blood by the liver. Non limiting examples of commonly prescribed statins include Atorvastatin Fluvastatin Lovastatin Pravastatin and Simvastatin.

Ezetimibe is the first of a new class of cholesterol absorption inhibitors that potently and selectively inhibits dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption at the brush border of the intestinal epithelium without affecting the absorption of triglyceride or fat soluble vitamins. Ezetimibe thus reduces overall cholesterol delivery to the liver secondarily inducing increased expression of LDL receptors resulting in an increased removal of LDL C from the plasma.

Peroxisome is a single membrane organelle present in nearly all eukaryotic cells. One of the most important metabolic processes of the peroxisome is the oxidation of long and very long chain fatty acids. The peroxisome is also involved in bile acid synthesis cholesterol synthesis plasmalogen synthesis amino acid metabolism and purine metabolism.

Nicotinic acid is a known agent that lowers total cholesterol LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels while raising HDL cholesterol levels. There are three types of nicotinic acid drugs immediate release timed release and extended release. Nicotinic acid or niacin the water soluble B vitamin improves all lipoproteins when given in doses well above the vitamin requirement.

Squalene an isoprenoid compound structurally similar to beta carotene is an intermediate metabolite in the synthesis of cholesterol. In humans about 60 percent of dietary squalene is absorbed. It is transported in serum generally in association with very low density lipoproteins and is distributed ubiquitously in human tissues with the greatest concentration in the skin where it is one of the major components of skin surface lipids. Squalene inhibitors e.g. monooxygenase and synthase serve as cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors.

Proliferative Activated Receptor PPAR agonists e.g. fibrates are fatty acid activated members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that play important roles in lipid and glucose metabolism and have been implicated in obesity related metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia insulin resistance and coronary artery disease. Fibrates are generally effective in lowering elevated plasma triglycerides and cholesterol and act as PPAR agonists. The most pronounced effect of fibrates includes a decrease in plasma triglyceride rich lipoproteins TRLs . Levels of LDL cholesterol LDL C generally decrease in individuals with elevated baseline plasma concentrations and HDL cholesterol HDL C levels are usually increased when baseline plasma concentrations are low. Non limiting examples of commonly prescribed fibrates include bezafibrate gemfibrozil and fenofibrate.

Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein CETP inhibitors play a major role in atherogenesis by reducing cholesteryl ester accumulation within macrophages and the arterial wall and thus reducing foam cell formation and affecting the cholesterol absorption.

The HSP family consists of approximately 25 proteins discerned by their molecular weights with highly conserved structures. Almost all humans have cellular and humoral immune reactions against microbial heat shock protein 60 HSP60 . Because a high degree of antigenic homology exists between microbial bacterial and parasitic and human HSP60 the cost of immunity to microbes might be the danger of cross reactivity with human HSP60 expressed by the endothelial cells of stressed arteries. Genuine autoimmunity against altered autologous HSP60 might trigger this process also Wick et al. Atherosclerosis as an autoimmune disease an update. TRENDS in Immunology. 2001 22 12 665 669 . HSP has been implicated as a target autoantigen in several experimental autoimmune diseases arthritis type I diabetes . Anti HSP65 as well as anti HSP60 antibodies have been demonstrably associated with atheromatous lesions in humans. Studies conducted in rabbits and mice show that the generation of an HSP65 induced immune response by immunization with the recombinant protein or with an HSP65 rich preparation of enhances atherogenesis. As autoimmune processes pointing to HSP65 as a possible antigenic candidate creating a state of unresponsiveness by induction of mucosal tolerization has been employed in order to block these responses our group reported that early atherosclerosis was attenuated in HSP65 fed mice compared with either BSA or PBS fed mice Harats et al. Oral tolerance with heat shock protein 65 attenuates induced and high fat diet driven atherosclerosis lesions. J Am Coll Cardiol. 2002 40 1333 1338 this was further supported by Maron who demonstrated that nasal vaccination with HSP reduces the inflammatory process associated with atherosclerosis Maron et al.

Beta 2 glycoprotein I beta2GPI is a phospholipid binding protein shown to serve as a target for prothrombotic antiphospholipid antibodies. It has recently been demonstrated to drive an immune mediated reaction and enhance murine atherosclerosis. Antibodies to beta 2 GPI have the ability to activate monocytes and endothelial cells and can induce an immune response to beta2GPI in atherosclerosis prone mice accelerated atherosclerosis. When beta2GPI reactive lymph node and spleen cells were transferred to LDL receptor deficient mice they promoted fatty streak formation proving a direct proatherogenic role for beta2GPI specific lymphocytes. Inducing immunological tolerance to beta2GPI by prior oral feeding with the antigen resulted in a significant reduction in the extent of atherosclerotic lesions. Thus beta2GPI is a candidate player in the atherosclerotic plaque and can possibly be employed as an immunomodulator of plaque progression. Oral feeding with of beta2GPI inhibited lymph node cell reactivity to beta2GPI in mice immunized against the human protein. IL 4 and IL 10 production was upregulated in lymph node cells of beta2GPI tolerant mice immunized against beta2GPI upon priming with the respective protein. Thus oral administration of beta2GPI is an effective means of suppressing atherogenesis in mice George et al. Suppression of early atherosclerosis in LDL receptor deficient mice by oral tolerance with beta2 glycoprotein I. Cardiovasc Res. 2004 62 3 603 9 .

The present inventors have demonstrated that immunization with the stable etherified synthetic LDL component ALLE can reduce the extent of atherosclerotic plaque formation in susceptible mice. 19 female 5 7 weeks old Apo E C 57 mice were divided into 3 groups. In group A n 6 the mice were immunized intraperitoneally as described in Materials and Methods section above with 150 g mouse L ALLE D ALLE once every 2 weeks 0.3 mi mouse X4. In group B n 6 the mice were immunized with tuberculin toxin Purified Protein Derivative PPD once every 2 weeks 0.3 ml mouse . In group C n 7 the mice received no immunization. Mice from all three groups were bled prior to immunization Time 0 and one week after the second immunization for determination of anti ox LDL antibodies anti ALLE antibodies and lipid profile. Atherosclerosis assessment was performed as described above 4.5 weeks post 4immunization. The mice from all groups were weighed at 2 week intervals throughout the experiment. All mice were fed normal chow diet containing 4.5 fat by weight 0.02 cholesterol and water ad libitum.

As can be seen in the results depicted in Table I demonstrate the significant reduction in atheromatous lesions measured in the heart tissues of the ALLE immunized mice compared to both PPD and unimmunized control mice. No significant effect is apparent on other parameters measured such as weight gain triglyceride or cholesterol plasma levels or immune competence as measured by the levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF . Thus immunization with the synthetic oxidized LDL component ALLE a mixture of racemic forms D and L confers significant 50 protection from atherosclerotic lesion formation in these genetically susceptible Apo E KO mice. A significant but less dramatic reduction in plaquing was observed in mice immunized with PPD.

Intraperitoneal immunization with the ester analogs of plaque lesion components was effective in inhibiting atherogenesis in Apo E KO mice .

Thus the ability of oral administration of L and D ALLE to suppress atherogenesis was investigated. 34 male 8 10 week old Apo E KO mice were divided into three groups. In group A n 11 mice were orally administered by gavage of L ALLE D ALLE suspended in PBS 5 ethanol 1 mg mouse for 5 days every other day. In group B n 11 mice were fed with 10 g mouse L ALLE D ALLE suspended in PBS 5 ethanol for 5 days every other day. 0.2 ml mouse . Mice in group C n 12 received PBS containing the same volume of ethanol as in groups A B . Mice were bled prior to feeding Time 0 and at the conclusion of the experiment End for determination of lipid profile. Atherosclerosis was assessed in the aorta sinus as described above 8 weeks after the last feeding. Mice were weighed every 2 weeks during the experiment. All mice were fed normal chow diet containing 4.5 fat by weight 0.02 cholesterol and water ad libitum.

As can be seen from the results depicted in Table 2 demonstrate a striking attenuation of atherosclerotic progression measured in the tissues of mice fed low doses 10 g 1 mg mouse of ALLE compared to unexposed control mice. No significant effect is apparent on other parameters measured such as weight gain triglyceride or cholesterol blood levels or immune competence as measured by the levels of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF . Thus oral administration of the synthetic oxidized LDL component ALLE provides for significant 50 protection from atherosclerosis in these genetically susceptible Apo E KO mice similar to the protection achieved with peritoneal immunization see .

Mechanisms of mucosal mediated immunomodulation are active in the nasal mucosa as well as the gut. Thus nasal exposure and oral exposure to L and D ALLE were compared for their effectiveness in suppressing atherogenesis in Apo E KO mice. 34 male 7 10 weeks old Apo E KO mice were divided into 3 groups. In group A n 11 mice were orally administered with L ALLE suspended in PBS 5 ethanol 1 mg mouse 0.2 ml for 5 days every other day. In group B n 11 mice were nasally administered as described above in Materials and Methods with 10 g mouse 10 L ALLE suspended in PBS every other day for 3 days. Mice in group C n 12 received PBS administered orally and nasally containing the same volume of ethanol as in groups A B . Mice were bled prior to feeding Time 0 and at the conclusion of the experiment End for determination of lipid profile. Atherosclerosis was assessed in the aorta sinus as described above 8 weeks after the last feeding. Mice were weighed every 2 weeks during the experiment. All mice were fed normal chow diet containing 4.5 fat by weight 0.02 cholesterol and water ad libitum.

As can be seen from the results depicted in Table 3 demonstrate effective inhibition of atherogenesis measured in the tissues of mice receiving nasal exposure to low doses 10 g mouse of ALLE compared to unexposed control mice. Nasal administration like oral administration had no significant effect on other parameters measured such as weight gain triglyceride or cholesterol plasma levels. Thus the synthetic oxidized LDL component ALLE provides for significant approximately 50 protection from atherogenesis in these genetically susceptible Apo E KO mice by both oral and nasal administrations.

Immunomodulation induced by mucosal exposure to oxidized analogs of LDL may be mediated by suppression of specific immune responses to the plaque related antigens. POVPC 1 Hexadecanoyl 2 5 oxo valeroyl sn glycerophosphocholine is a non ether oxidized LDL analog which unlike ALLE is susceptible to breakdown in the liver and gut. Lymphocyte proliferation in response to oral exposure to both POVPC and the more stable analog ALLE was measured in Apo E KO mice. 8 male 6 week old Apo E KO mice were divided into 3 groups. In group A n 2 mice were fed with 1 mg mouse L ALLE suspended in 0.2 ml PBS administered by gavage as described above every other day for 5 days. In group B n 3 mice were fed with 1 mg mouse POVPC suspended in 0.2 ml PBS administered per os as described above every other day for 5 days. The mice in group C n 3 control were fed with 200 l PBS every other day for 5 days. Immune reactivity was stimulated by immunization with Human oxidized LDL as described above in the Materials and Methods section one day after the last feeding. One week after the immunization lymph nodes were collected for assay of proliferation. All mice were fed normal chow diet containing 4.5 fat by weight 0.02 cholesterol and water ad libitum.

As can be seen from the results depicted in Table 4 demonstrate significant suppression of immune reactivity to Human oxidized LDL antigen measured by inhibition of proliferation in the lymph nodes of Apo E KO mice. Lymphocytes from mice receiving oral exposure to atherogenesis inhibiting doses 1 mg mouse of ALLE or POVPC showed a reduced stimulation index following immunization with ox LDL as compared to control PBS mice. Since induction of oral mediated like nasal mediated immunomodulation had no significant effect on other parameters measured such as weight gain triglyceride or cholesterol plasma levels or immune competence see Tables 1 2 and 3 these results indicate a specific suppression of anti ox LDL immune reactivity. Thus oral administration of the synthetic oxidized LDL component L ALLE is an effective method of attenuating the cellular immune response to immunogenic and atherogenic plaque components in these genetically susceptible Apo E KO mice. also demonstrates a similar if less effective inhibition of proliferation with oral administration of the less stable synthetic oxidized LDL component POVPC.

Since feeding of ALLE and POVPC was shown to inhibit early atherogenesis and immune reactivity to plaque related Human LDL antigen the ability of both D and L isomers of the ether LDL analog and the non ether analog POVPC to suppress the progression of atherogenesis in older mice was compared. Their effect on the triglyceride and cholesterol fractions of VLDL was also monitored by FPLC. 57 male 24.5 week old Apo E KO mice were divided into 5 groups. In group A n 11 mice were fed with 1 mg mouse L ALLE suspended in 0.2 ml PBS administered by gavage as described above every other day for 5 days. In group B n 9 mice were fed with 1 mg mouse D ALLE suspended in 0.2 ml PBS administered per os as described above every other day for 5 days. In group C n 10 mice were fed with 1 mg mouse POVPC suspended in 0.2 ml PBS administered by gavage as described above every other day for 5 days. Control group D n 10 received oral administration of PBS containing the same volume of ethanol as in groups A B C . Base line group was sacrificed on time 0. Oral administration of the tested antigens took place every 4 weeks 5 oral feedings every other day starting at 24.5 weeks age during 12 weeks 3 sets of feedings .

Mice were bled prior to feeding Time 0 after the 2set of feeding and at the conclusion of the experiment End for determination of lipid profile lipid fractionation and plasma collection. Atherosclerosis was assessed as described above in the aorta sinus and aorta. Spleens were collected for proliferation assay 12 weeks after the first feeding. Weight was recorded every 2 weeks throughout the experiment. All mice were fed normal chow diet containing 4.5 fat by weight 0.02 cholesterol and water ad libitum.

The ability of a stable form of an etherified phospholipid the acid derivative of ALLE CI 201 to suppress atherogenesis was investigated. Male 12 weeks old Apo E KO mice were divided into two groups. In group A n 14 mice were orally administered by gavage of CI 201 0.025 mg dose suspended in PBS for 8 weeks every day 5 times a week . Mice in group B n 15 received PBS control . Atherosclerosis was assessed as described above. All mice were fed normal chow diet containing 4.5 fat by weight 0.02 cholesterol and water ad libitum.

As can be seen from the results demonstrate a striking attenuation of atherosclerotic progression measured in the tissues of mice fed low doses of CI 201 as compared with unexposed control mice PBS . Aortic sinus lesion in the CI 201 treated group was 125 192 19 824 mand in the control group PBS treated was 185 400 20 947 m demonstrating a decrease of 33 P 0.051 of the aortic sinus lesion by oral administration of CI 201 in low dose. IL 10 expression determined by RT PCR in the aorta was higher by 40 in the CI 201 treated group as compared with the control group. The elevated expression levels of IL 10 in the target organ the aorta support an anti inflammatory effect induced by CI 201 oral administration. Thus the stable synthetic oxidized LDL 201 exerts both oral mediated immunomodulation and anti inflammatory effect.

The effect of ALLE CI 201 its corresponding acetal derivatives Et acetal and Me acetal Compounds IIa and IIb and oxLDL on cytokine expression in the target organ the aorta was evaluated using RT PCR as described hereinabove. Apo E KO mice were orally administered with 1 mg mouse ALLE 1 mg mouse CI 201 1 mg mouse Et acetal 1 mg mouse Me acetal 0.1 mg mouse oxLDL or 0.2 ml mouse PBS. Oral administrations took place 5 times every other day. The expression of the anti inflammatory cytokine IL 10 and the pro inflammatory cytokine IFN and IL 12 were determined 8 weeks after final oral administration.

As can be seen in and mice treated with ALLE CI 201 Et acetal Me acetal and oxLDL showed elevated levels of IL 10 expression as compared with the control PBS treated group. As can be seen in and an opposite effect was shown in the expression level of IFN and IL 12. Reduced expression levels of IFN was detectable in mice treated with ALLE CI 201 Me acetal and oxLDL and reduced levels of IL 12 was detectable in mice treated with ALLE CI 201 Et acetal and oxLDL.

In order to show that the synthetic oxidized phospholipids described above induce a similar effect as human oxidized LDL a model for evaluating the effect of oxLDL on atherosclerosis progression in mice was designed.

LDL RD Mice 8 12 weeks old were stratified by age weight and lipid profile Cholesterol and Triglyceride to different groups. Each group was treated with oxLDL in escalating doses 10 100 or 1 000 g dose dissolved in PBS in a total volume of 0.2 ml PBS albumin 100 g dose dissolved in PBS in a total volume of 0.2 ml PBS or PBS 0.2 ml 5 times every other day. One day following the last oral administration mice were challenged with an atherogenic diet Western diet ad libitum and kept in 12 hours dark light cycle for five weeks.

Mice were sacrificed 6.5 weeks after the first oral administration and evaluated for the extent of atheromatous plaque area within the aortic sinus as described hereinabove.

The effect of oxLDL treatment on metabolic parameters is delineated in Table 6 below. As is shown in Table 6 while oxLDL did not affect body weight or cholesterol levels OxLDL in a dose of 100 g dose significantly P

The attenuation of atherogenesis by oral administration of OxLDL is demonstrated in and in Table 7 below. As is shown in treatment with both 100 g dose and 1 000 g dose oxLDL significantly decreased P

26 28 weeks old Apo E KO mice APO E C57B 6J were used as a prevention of progression model. Mice were stratified by age weight and lipid profile cholesterol and triglyceride to different groups. One group was sacrificed at the beginning of the experiment and served as the base line group. Each of the other groups was treated with CI 201 in escalating doses 0.1 1 or 10 g dose dissolved in PBS 0.05 ethanol in a total volume of 0.2 ml PBS . The control group received PBS 0.05 ethanol 0.2 ml .

Mice were treated with CI 201 or PBS at three sets at the beginning of each month each set consisted of 5 oral administrations every other day. All mice were fed normal chow diet containing 4.5 fat by weight 0.02 cholesterol and water ad libitum and were kept in a 12 hours dark light cycle.

After 12 weeks mice were sacrificed and evaluated for the extent of atheromatous plaque area within the aortic sinus as described hereinabove.

The effect of CI 201 treatment on metabolic parameters is presented in Table 8 below. The results show that CI 201 does not affect both the body weight and the lipid profile of the tested mice.

The attenuation of atherogenesis by oral administration of CI 201 is demonstrated in and in Table 9 below.

The results presented in Table 9 show that CI 201 treatment completely. inhibited disease progression such that the lesion areas in the aortic sinus of mice treated with different doses of CI 201 were similar to that of the base line group.

As is demonstrated in all doses of CI 201 inhibited the disease progression while the most effective dose was the minimal dose of 0.1 g dose. As is demonstrated in the group treated with 0.1 g dose CI 201 exhibit a 92 significant P

In view of the dramatic inhibition of atherosclerosis progression by oral administration of CI 201 which as described hereinabove is not attributed to alteration of body weight or lipid profile induced thereby the effect of oral administration of CI 201 on the level of inflammation markers in the serum was evaluated in order to investigate its mechanism of action.

As is shown in experimental and clinical studies IL 10 is a major protective cytokine in plaque growth and stability. For example Caligiuri et al. Interleukin 10 deficiency increases atherosclerosis thrombosis and low density lipoproteins in apolipoprotein E knockout mice. 2003 9 1 2 10 17 recently reported that lesion size was dramatically increased in double KO mice for Apo E and IL 10 as compared with controls and the proteolitic and procoagulant activity were elevated showing that IL 10 may reduce atherosclerosis and improve the stability of plaques.

Another marker of acute inflammatory state is Serum Amyloide A SAA a high sensitive inflammatory marker which can be increased up to 1 000 fold during inflammation. SAA as a CRP C Reactive Protein is synthesized by the liver in response to IL 1 IL 6 and TNF Balke and Ridker Novel clinical markers of vascular wall inflammation 2001 89 763 771. . SAA has been found to be expressed by several cell types in atherosclerotic lesion Meek et al. Expression of apolipoprotein serum amyloid A mRNA in human atherosclerotic lesions and cultured vascular cells implications for serum amyloid A function. 1994 91 3186 3190 Uhlar and Whitehead. Serum amyloid A the major vertebrate acute phase reactant. 1999 265 501 523 .

Initiation of the inflammatory cascade occurs primarily through activated blood monocytes and tissue macrophages at the site of the inflammatory stimulus. Upon activation macrophages release a range of primary inflammatory mediators the most important of which are members of the IL 1 and TNF cytokine families which trigger the release of a range of secondary cytokines and chemokines IL 6 IL 8 and MCP . The chemotactic activities of these molecules draw leukocytes to the inflammatory site where they in turn release further pro inflammatory cytokines.

Thus Apo E KO mice were orally administered with 0.1 g mouse CI 201 or 0.2 ml mouse PBS 5 times every other day. Mice serum was collected before treatment day 0 at the end of the treatment two weeks and two weeks thereafter 4 weeks and the level of the inflammation markers IL 10 and Serum Amyloide A SAA were evaluated.

As can be seen in at the end of the treatment 2 weeks a substantial increase in IL 10 serum level was observed while 2 weeks thereafter 4 weeks a decay has been noticed. In the control PBS treated group no change in IL 10 serum levels was noticed throughout the experiment.

As can be seen in while SAA serum levels dramatically increased in the control group no alterations in SAA serum levels in the CI 201 treated group were observed.

These results clearly indicate that by elevating IL 10 levels in the serum CI 201 induce an anti inflammatory response that may shut down a pro inflammatory response demonstrated by elevated levels of SAA. Systemic inflammation manifested by high SAA may promote atherosclerotic plaque destabilization in addition to exerting a possible direct effect on atherogenesis. These results further suggest a direct effect of CI 201 on inflammatory processes.

The effects of CI 201 treatment on cytokine expression in the targeted organ the aorta as well as in the spleen liver kidneys and small intestine were evaluated using RT PCR as described hereinabove. Apo E KO mice were orally administered with 1 mg dose CI 201 or with 0.2 ml mouse PBS 5 times every other day. The expression of the anti inflammatory cytokine IL 10 and the pro inflammatory cytokine IFN were determined 8 weeks after final oral administration. The data obtained are presented in and .

As can be seen in and mice treated with CI 201 showed elevated levels of the anti inflammatory cytokine IL 10 as compared with the control PBS treated group while an opposite effect namely reduced expression level was shown in the expression level of the pro inflammatory cytokine IFN in the CI 201 treated group.

The increase in the anti inflammatory response as demonstrated by elevated levels of IL 10 accompanied with decreased pro inflammatory response as demonstrated by decreased levels of IFN further emphasize the immunomodulation induced by CI 201 which is effected by switching from Th1 towards Th2 response within the aorta as well as the anti inflammatory effect thereof

While in the targeted organ the aorta CI 201 increases the anti inflammatory response such an effect was not observed in other organs. As can be seen in no differences were observed in cytokine expression in the spleen and in the small intestine between the CI 201 treated group and the control PBS treated group. It is suggested that the Peyers patches located therein encountered the orally administered antigen. No change in cytokine expression was observed in the liver and in kidney as well data not shown .

The results above suggest that the oxidized phospholipids analogs of the present invention inhibit atherosclerosis via a pathway that affects both the immune system and inflammation. However it is possible that other mechanisms are also involved in the most potent inhibitory effect thereof.

Rheumatoid arthritis RA is a severe autoimmune disease involving chronic joint inflammation and destruction. Adjuvant induced arthritis AIA is the first experimental arthritis model Pearson.

Studies of polyarthritis and other lesions induced in rats by injection of mycobacterial adjuvant. I. general clinical and pathologic characteristics and some modifying factors. 1959 2 440 459 .

The morphologic character of early AIA lesions is based on cell mediated immunity CMI . Lymphocytes infiltration is followed by edema fibrin deposition and necrosis accompanied by proliferation of synoviocytes and fibroblasts and activation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The inflammatory infiltrate in the joint lesions of AIA contain T cells activated by specific antigens. Th1 cytokines such as IL 17 IFN and TNF are expressed in early AIA together with cytokines characteristics of macrophage activation. In a later phase of the disease levels of IL 4 IL 6 and JE murine homologe of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and TGF are elevated. There is local release of proteolytic enzymes and or free radicals of oxygen which results in a progressive breakdown of collagen type II and DC matrix damage and in time degradation of bone Van Eden and Waksman.

Several attempts at immunotherapy of human autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis RA type I diabetes and multiple sclerosis based either on modulation of individual immune pathways involved in inflammation or on tolerization to various antigens have shown that this approach may be viable Bielekova et al.

In many patients the outcome of Rheumatoid Arthritis is complicated by cardiovascular disease the latter being the main cause of the increased mortality in this disorder. Autoantibodies against cardiolipin CL and oxidatively modified low density lipoproteins copper oxidized LDL including malondialdehyde modified LDL MDA LDL have been suggested to have a predictive value for cardiovascular disease. It has been demonstrated that there are increased levels of autoantibodies against copper oxidized low density lipoprotein malondialdehyde modified low density lipoproteins and cardiolipin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis Cvetkovic et al. Increased levels of autoantibodies against copper oxidized low density lipoprotein malondialdehyde modified low density lipoprotein and cardiolipin in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. 2002 41 988 995 . Moreover there are evidences for oxidized low density lipoprotein in synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis patients Dai et al.

Since CI 201 was found to be effective in both induction of immunomodulation to Ox LDL and increasing an anti inflammatory response its effect on arthritis development was tested.

Nine weeks old male Lewis rats were orally administered with different doses of CI 201 4 mg kg or 0.4 mg kg or with PBS 5 times every other day. Adjuvant arthritis was then induced by intradermal injection of 0.1 ml of tuberculosis suspension. Intensity of arthritis was monitored by measuring paw swelling while mobility of the animals was monitored as well. The study design is presented in . The results are presented in .

As can be seen in pre treatment with the higher dose 4.0 mg kg of CI 201 resulted in a significant decrease in rats paw swelling as compared with the control PBS pretreated rats.

While the PBS treated rats were barely moving using only their back legs the mobility of rats pre treated with the higher dose of CI 201 was close to that of normal rats.

In order to evaluate the effect of a continuous treatment with CI 201 on AIA induced Lewis rats following the AIA induction 9 weeks old male Lewis rats were fed 5 times every other day before induction of AIA by intradermal injection of 0.1 ml of tuberculosis suspension and were thereafter continuously fed three times a week for about 30 days. The study design is presented in . The results are presented in .

As can be seen in CI 201 a continuous treatment with high dose of CI 201 substantially attenuated arthritis development in all the tested parameters.

These results clearly indicate that the anti inflammatory properties of CI 201 can further influence a classic inflammatory disease RA in addition to its effect on atherosclerosis.

CD4 T helper cells and macrophages infiltrate the synovial membrane SM in chronic destructive rheumatoid arthritis and probably play a central role in promoting and maintaining the disease process. CD4 T cells can differentiate into Th1 subpopulation characterized by predominant production of IFN . Predominance of pro inflammatory Th1 type cells has been postulated in RA Schmidt Weber et al. Cytokine gene activation in synovial membrane regional lymph nodes and spleen during the course of rat adjuvant arthritis. 1999 195 53 65. . Macrophages are also highly activated in the inflammatory process in RA both locally and systemically.

The resemblances in the inflammatory response involved both in atherosclerosis and arthritis support the suggestion that CI 201 induces an anti inflammatory response in AIA similarly to that demonstrated above in atherosclerosis.

It can therefore be postulated that CI 201 treatment induce IL 10 elevation in AIA model and IL 10 can suppress pro inflammatory cytokine thus reducing the disease outcome as was demonstrated by decreased paw swelling and better mobility. These results therefore implicate that the oxidized phospholipids analogs of the present invention can serve as a new family of therapeutic drug for treating Rheumatoid Arthritis as well as other autoimmune and or inflammatory diseases.

The effect of the oxidized group in ALLE and CI 201 was tested by comparing the effect of oral administration of ALLE and CI 201 on early atherogenesis and progression of advanced atherosclerotic plaques shown above with the effect of the pre oxidized derivative thereof Compound V 1 Hexadecyl 2 5 hexenyl sn glycero 3 phosphocholine Example I .

25 female 8 10 week old Apo E KO mice were divided into 4 groups. Each group was fed with 5 mg mouse Compound V suspended in 0.2 ml PBS Group A n 6 1 mg mouse Compound V suspended in 0.2 ml PBS Group B n 6 0.2 mg mouse Compound V suspended in 0.2 ml PBS Group C n 6 and PBS Group D control n 7 every other day for 5 days. Eight weeks after the last oral administration mice were sacrificed. Mice were bled prior to feeding Time 0 and at the conclusion of the experiment End for determination of lipid profile. Atherosclerosis was assessed in the heart as described hereinabove. All mice were fed normal chow diet containing 4.5 fat by weight 0.02 cholesterol and water ad libitum.

The effect of Compound V treatment on metabolic parameters and on atherogenesis is delineated in Table 10 below. The effect of Compound V on atherogenesis is further presented in .

As can be clearly seen in while oral administration of the oxidized compounds CI 201 and ALLE substantially inhibited atherogenesis in Apo E KO mice no effect on atherogenesis was observed following treatment with the pre oxidized derivative Compound V thus indicating the importance of the presence of the oxidized group in treating atherogenesis.

The pre oxidized Compound V was further tested in the prevention of progression model in ApoE KO mice described hereinabove. 23 26 weeks old Apo E KO mice APO E C57B 6J were stratified by age weight and lipid profile cholesterol and triglyceride to different groups. One group was sacrificed at the beginning of the experiment and served as the base line group B.L. n 10 . The second group was treated with Compound V 0.1 g dose n 10 dissolved in PBS 0.05 ethanol in a total volume of 0.2 ml PBS. The control group received PBS 0.05 ethanol 0.2 ml n 11 .

Mice were treated with compound V or PBS at three sets at the beginning of each month each set consisted of 5 oral administrations every other day. All mice were fed normal chow diet containing 4.5 fat by weight 0.02 cholesterol and water ad libitum and were kept in a 12 hours dark light cycle.

After 12 weeks mice were sacrificed and evaluated for lipid profile and extent of atheromatous plaque area within the aortic sinus as described herein above. The results are presented in Table 11 below and in and clearly indicate that oral administration of Compound V did not effect atherogenesis progression.

As indicated above oral administration of CI 201 reduces the level of IFN messenger RNA in the aortas of ApoE mice. As T cells are a major source of IFN and Th1 cells were shown to play a role in atherosclerosis the effect of CI 201 treatment on IFN production by CD4 T cells was assessed.

The data presented in demonstrates that in vivo treatment with CI 201 resulted in reduced IFN production by CD4 T cells.

In light of the above it was speculated that CI 201 might have a direct inhibitory effect on IFN production by T cells. To address that radiolabeled CI 201 was incubated with different immune cell lines and the level of incorporation was measured. Unexpectedly the highest CI 201 incorporation was detected in DC s and macrophages and not in T cells which showed a mild increase in radioactive levels only at the 24 hours time point compared to control cells . Accordingly it was hypothesized that CI 201 impairs IFN production by CD4 T cells through regulation of IL 12p40 p40 secretion by APC s.

To test that BMDC s were activated with several TLR antagonists in the presence of varying concentrations of CI 201. Supernatants collected 24 hours later were assayed for the production of p40 by ELISA. demonstrate that IL12p40 production was inhibited to various degrees by CI 201 treatment following activation of BMDC s with the different TLR ligands used. When BMDC S were activated with PGN TLR 2 6 a significant and dose dependent reduction in p40 production was observed while activation with another TLR 2 ligand Pam3CSK4 TLR1 2 resulted in significant p40 inhibition .

The effect on p40 production was then tested following activation with LPS an agonist to TLR4 that signals downstream through both Myd88 dependent and independent pathways. A significant but small reduction of p40 levels were detected in the presence of intermediated concentrations of CI 201 .

Next the effect of CI 201 on p40 production from DC s activated through intracellular TLR was investigated. While a significant and dose dependent p40 inhibition with CI 201 could be noticed following PolyI C TLR3 activation Myd88 independent only 20 g ml of CI 201 was able to significantly inhibit p40 secretion after CpG TLR9 engagement . To determine whether CI 201 conveys its inhibitory function via interfering with TLR binding BMDC s were activated with Fc CD40L. This induces cytokine production by BMDC s in a TLR MyD88 independent pathway. As shown in Fc CD40L activation in the presence of CI 201 resulted in a significant reduction of p40 secretion by BMDC s.

Because activation of BMDC s through TLR s and CD40 is known to induce the production of cytokines other than p40 TNF levels were measured following activation with all TLR agonists used above. In addition IL 6 and IL 1 levels were also measured following PGN DC s activation in the presence of CI 201. The results presented in demonstrate that except for PolyI C CI 201 did not impair the production of TNF by other activators and likewise did not impair the production of IL 6 and IL 1 following PGN activation of BMDC s. Taken together these results suggest that CI 201 impedes a particular pathway responsible for the induction of p40 production while leaving pathways regulating acute proinflammatory cytokine production unaffected.

In order to determine p40 s level of regulation and to reveal putative additional modified genes subsequent to CI 201 treatment gene chip analysis was conducted on purified CD11c BMDC s activated for 3 hours with PGN in the presence of CI 201.

Several genes were found to be up regulated and 5 genes including p40 had a reduced RNA expression. In order to confirm the gene chip results and examine p40 s regulation kinetics by CI 201 quantitative real time PCR was performed for p40 and for the paired chains constituting IL12 p35 IL 23 p19 and IL 27 p28 with the latter recently shown to play a role in IFN production by T cells as well. Similar to the results obtained from the gene chip analysis CI 201 clearly inhibited p40 RNA expression in the first 6 hours following activation by more than two folds compared to control. It was also discovered that treatment with CI 201 resulted in a substantial inhibition of the RNA expression level of p19 . Following reevaluation of the gene chip results a reduced p19 expression in the CI 201 treated cells was indeed observed thereby confirming the real time PCR results. CI 201 did not modify the RNA expression levels of p35 and p28 . These results indicate that CI 201 regulates the RNA expression levels of IL 12 and IL 23 two key pro inflammatory cytokines shown to play a pivotal role in inflammatory diseases.

Since CI 201 leads to the reduction of p40 expression from activated BMDC s the effect of CI 201 on human cells was also examined. Mo DC s were activated with PGN in the presence of CI 201 and the supernatants were tested for p40 and TNF production.

The results depicted in indicate that CI 201 can inhibit p40 production by activated Mo DC s without altering the cells ability to produce TNF .

The data presented above clearly demonstrate that CI 201 can regulate p40 production by DC s. The next experiment was performed in order to test whether p40 inhibition could be detected when CI 201 is applied on total PBMC s and monocytes macrophages.

PBMC s from healthy donors were incubated over night with IFN and then activated with PGN in the presence of CI 201 for another 24 hours. Supernatants were then evaluated for p40 and TNF production. As observed with DC s CI 201 inhibited p40 production when applied to PGN activated PBMC s from two different donors. However unlike with DC s a close to complete inhibition of p40 production could be achieved in all CI 201 s tested concentrations . In agreement with the DC data above CI 201 did not impair TNF production by PBMC s from donor I while a modest reduction in TNF levels was measured from donor II PBMC s .

In order to assess CI 201 effect on p40 production by macrophages splenic CD11b cells were incubated over night with IFN and then activated for 24 hours with PGN in the presence CI 201. When supernatants were evaluated for p40 no major differences in p40 and TNF production levels were observed between control and CI 201 treated cells suggesting that CI 201 may selectively act on DC s .

The in vitro experiments described hereinabove demonstrated that p40 production by activated DC s could be maximally inhibited by the highest concentration of CI 201 used 20 g ml . However based on others previous experience with small molecules designed for therapeutic applications it is highly desirable to reach beneficial effect with lower substance concentration in the range of ng ml. Therefore it was a priority to design a superior molecule on the backbone of CI 201 that will exhibit similar in vitro effect on p40 production when applied to DC s. To attain such a molecule it is important to establish the residue s which are essential for CI 201 s functionality.

In a set of experiments BMDC s were activated with PGN in the presence of commercially available and self synthesized oxidized and non oxidized phospholipids with p40 production levels placed as the measured parameter to determine inhibitory efficacy. Preliminary results indicated that several facets such as the length the chemical composition and the chemical bonds of each chain should be considered in future molecular designs. Thus replacement of the hydrogen group for a methyl group in R2 methyl ester of CI 201 and removal of the phosphocholine group in R3 non phosphorylated metabolite of CI 201 restored p40 production . Nonetheless exchange of the three methyl groups in R3 for three hydrogen molecules phosphoethanol amine did not alter the molecule s p40 inhibitory effect . A group of molecules some closely resembling the structure of CI 201 POVPC and PVPC were tested all bearing an esteric bond on R1 and R2 instead of the etheric bonds found in CI 201. A third group of molecules was also selected for testing that were derived from PAF which has some similarities to CI 201. It was found that PAF itself and PAF2C with an extended R2 molecule were efficient in p40 inhibition . Shortening of R2 mildly reduced the activity of PAF but an additional esteric bond in R1 elongation by 2 methyl group of R2 or a long R2 with oxidized edge all resulted in loss of p40 inhibition .
