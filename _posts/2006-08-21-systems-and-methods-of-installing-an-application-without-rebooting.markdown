The present invention generally relates to data communication networks and in particular to systems and methods for automatically installing for a non administrative user a change in version to a client agent used for communicating with an appliance.

In some systems an appliance provides a client computer with access to a network. In one kind of system an appliance may provide the client computer with secure access to a private network via virtual private network VPN connection. The client computer may use a client agent to access the functionality or services provided by the appliance. For example the client agent may establish a virtual private network connection to a network via the appliance. In some cases the client agent may be installed under an administrative user or with administrative privileges. As such any changes to the client agent may also require administrative privileges.

Typically a network administrator may deploy an appliance to provide access to the network to a multitude of non administrative users such as remote or mobile users. In some cases the administrator may install on the appliance software maintenance revisions updates or upgrades to the appliance. In other cases the administrator may replace an appliance with a newer version of hardware such as another model. In one case a newer version of the client agent is available. In another cases the appliance may work with one or more versions of a client agent. As a result of any of these cases the network administrator may want to deploy a different version of the client agent to the vast user community. However the deployment and installation of the client agent to client computers of non administrative users can be challenging as the non administrative users do not have the required administrative privileges. Furthermore users of the system may be frustrated with not having the most up to date client agent an inappropriate version of the client agent or having to spend the time to install or get installed the client agent.

It would therefore be desirable to provide systems and methods for efficiently allowing a client computer of a non administrative user to automatically detect install and use a changed version of a client agent.

The present solution of the appliance and client agent described herein provides techniques for efficiently administering deploying and installing changed versions of a client agent to access an appliance. With an enterprise or corporate network providing access to a multitude of users via the appliance these systems and methods allow for a more efficient and automatic administration deployment and configuration of client agents to the user community. An appliance administrator can update and configure the appliance with a different version of the client agent to deploy to a client. With the present solution a non administrative user automatically seamlessly and transparently obtains access to and use of maintenance versions patches and upgrades of the client agent that are to be installed via administrative privileges.

In one aspect the present invention relates to a method for automatically upgrading or downgrading a version of a client agent for a non administrative user account without rebooting the user s machine. A service having installation privileges executes on the client and installs a client agent. The client agent communicates with a network appliance. The client agent detects a difference between its version and a version of the client agent identified by the network appliance. The agent signals the service that it has detected the difference and in response the service executes an installation program that installs without rebooting the client the version of the client agent identified by the appliance.

In some embodiments the service is installed on the client using an administrative user account. In other embodiments the version of the client agent identified by the appliance comprises one of an upgrade or a downgrade to the version of the first client agent. In still other embodiments the client agent transmits the difference signal as a socket event on a predetermined User Datagram Protocol port. In further embodiments the client agent receives a HyperText Markup language HTML file transmitted from the network appliance which has a tag identifying a version of the client agent. In still further embodiments the first client agent is a plugin to a web browser. In some of these embodiments the client agent unregisters itself with the web browser and deletes the HTML file from a cache of the web browser. In others of these embodiments the agent requests that the web browser reload the HTML file.

In another aspect the present invention relates to a system for automatically upgrading or downgrading a version of a client agent for a non administrative user account without rebooting the user s machine. A service having an installation privilege and executing on a client installs a client agent on the client for communicating with a network appliance. A client agent executing on behalf of a non administrative user detects a difference between a version of the client agent and a version of the client agent identified by the appliance. In response to detecting the version difference the client agent transmits a signal to the service which in response executes an installation program. The installation program installs the version of the client agent identified by the appliance without rebooting the client.

In some embodiments either the service or the installation program is installed on the client via an administrative user account. In other embodiments the version of the client agent identified by the appliance comprises one of an upgrade or a downgrade to the version of the first client agent. In other embodiments the first client agent transmits the difference detected signal as a socket event on a predetermined User Datagram Protocol port. In further embodiments the installed client agent receives a HyperText Markup language HTML file transmitted from the appliance the HTML file having a tag identifying the version of the client agent identified by the appliance. In still further embodiments the client agent is a plugin to a web browser. In some of these embodiments the client agent unregisters itself with the web browser and deletes the HTML file from a cache of the web browser. In others of these embodiments the client agent requests that the web browser to reload the HTML file.
