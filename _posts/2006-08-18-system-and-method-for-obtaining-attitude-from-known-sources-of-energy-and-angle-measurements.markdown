title: System and method for obtaining attitude from known sources of energy and angle measurements
abstract: A system and method of determining an orientation of a spinning object at a known GPS location comprises radially deploying antennae around a plurality of axes of measurement of the spinning object; determining a spin axis of a first end of the spinning object; measuring, using a frequency domain correlation, a roll angle corresponding to the spin axis in relation to a first plane of the GPS location; repeating the measuring process for multiple planes of the GPS location; and generating the orientation of the spinning object by combining all roll angle measurements. The method further comprises determining a sensing vector orthogonal to the spin axis; identifying at least two known GPS locations corresponding to the spinning object; and rotating the sensing vector about the spin axis until two of the known GPS locations become visible or are in the plane of the sensing vector and the spin axis.
