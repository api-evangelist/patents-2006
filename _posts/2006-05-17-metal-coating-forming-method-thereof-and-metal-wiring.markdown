The present invention relates to a metal coating formed by applying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid including metal nanoparticles to a base material and baking the applied liquid a method of forming the metal coating and a metal wiring formed by pattern formation of the metal coating.

In recent years techniques for forming metal coating using metal nanoparticles as a material of metal wiring have caught much attention. For example Patent document 1 discloses a method of forming a metal coating having a film thickness of 0.01 1 m in which method a metallic paste made by uniformly and fully dispersing metallic ultrafine particles having particle sizes of 0.001 0.1 m in an organic solvent is applied to a surface of a base material and thereafter the metallic paste is dried and baked.

Also in Patent document 2 a method of forming a metal coating is described in which method a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid having a viscosity of 1000 cP or less at room temperature is applied onto a surface of a base material and baked after being dried wherein the metallic nanoparticle dispersed liquid is prepared by dispersing metal nanoparticles consisting of Ag or silver oxide etc. and having a size of nano meter level in an organic solvent which does not easily evaporate at room temperature but evaporates when heated during a process of drying or baking a coated film in a manner such that the surface of each metallic nanoparticle is covered with the organic solvent and does not cause agglomeration so that an independent condition thereof may be achieved.

Moreover in Patent document 3 a method of forming a metal coating is described in which method a Cu independent ultrafine particles dispersed liquid having a viscosity of 50 cP or less is applied onto a surface of a base material and baked after being dried wherein the Cu independent ultrafine particles dispersed liquid is prepared by mixing ultrafine particles containing Cu metal particles having a particle size of 0.01 m or less and an organic solvent which does not easily evaporate at room temperature but evaporates during drying or baking a coated film in a process of forming a Cu wiring on a semiconductor substrate and wherein the surface of each Cu independent ultrafine particle is covered with the organic solvent and the individual Cu independent ultrafine particles are independently dispersed.

However according to the examination of the present inventors metal coatings formed by any of the inventions described in the above mentioned patent documents have shortcomings the surface is so rough that there is a problem in terms of smoothness and denseness of the metal coating. Also the metal coating has problems to be solved in respect of adhesion to the base material and the ease of processing by etching.

The objects of the present invention are to provide a metal coating having small surface roughness and superior in terms of the smoothness and the denseness and having excellent properties for etching and adhesion to a base material to provide a method of forming such metal coating and to provide a metal wiring formed by pattern formation of the metal coating.

A first aspect of the invention in the present patent application is a metal coating which is formed by baking after applying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid onto a surface of a base material the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid being composed of metal nanoparticles water and a dispersant having a molecular weight of 2000 30000 and having a solid form at room temperature wherein the metal coating comprises an alloy including 1 Ag and 2 at least one kind of metal selected from the group consisting of Au Pt Pd Ru Ir Sn Cu Ni Fe Co Ti and In the content ratio of Ag being 80 99.9 by atomic percent in the total quantity of the alloy and wherein the metal coating has an average grain size of 0.2 5 m.

In the first aspect of invention of the present patent application the dispersant contained in the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid which is to become a metal coating exists in a state of surrounding metal nanoparticles in the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid which contains water and the dispersant performs a function of preventing the metal nanoparticles from agglomeration. Also the water swells the dispersant well so that the metal nanoparticles surrounded by the dispersant may satisfactorily be dispersed without being agglomerated in the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid. Therefore by drying after applying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid to a surface of a base material it is possible to form a coated film which is dense and smooth and in which a void is not easily generated by baking.

Also at least one kind of metals used at the above mentioned ratio relative to Ag performs a function of restraining grain growth of the grain size of Ag during the baking of the coated film or a function of preventing a metal coating from being easily oxidized or a function of causing itself to be oxidized thereby improving the property of the metal coating so as to adhere to the base material which is mainly oxide. Therefore by baking the coated film it is possible to form a metal coating having an average grain size limited to 0.2 5 m and a uniform film thickness and which is not only smooth and dense without a void and the like but also superior in the property of adhesion to the base material.

In addition the metal coating thus formed not only exhibits the same ease of etching as that which consists of only Ag but also has high conductivity which is equivalent to or nearly equivalent to that of a metal coating which consists of only Ag. Moreover the above mentioned metal coating is superior in conductivity since it has an average grain size that is limited to 0.2 5 m and the grain boundaries thereof are less. Therefore according to the first aspect of invention of the present patent application it is possible to provide a metal coating which has not only smooth and dense film quality but also superior properties in terms of adhesion to a base material ease of etching and high conductivity.

A second aspect of the invention in the present patent application is a metal coating which is formed according to the above described first aspect wherein the metal coating comprises an alloy including 1 Ag and 2 1 a first metal which is at least one kind of metal selected from the group consisting of Au Pt Pd Ru and Ir and 2 2 a second metal which is at least one kind of metal selected from the group consisting of Sn Cu Ni Fe Co Ti and In the content ratio of the second metal being 0.1 2 by atomic percent in the total quantity of the alloy.

In the second aspect of invention of the present patent application the first metal classified as 2 1 and the second metal classified as 2 2 are both used together with Ag the former is superior in the properties of restraining grain growth of the grain size of Ag and preventing a metal coating from being easily oxidized during the baking and the latter is not only superior in the property of restraining the grain growth of the grain size of Ag during the baking the property of ease in etching and the property of causing itself to be oxidized during the baking so as to improve the adhesive property of the metal coating with respect to the base material which is mainly oxide but also the content ratio of the second metal is defined to be 0.1 2 by atomic percent. Therefore according to the second aspect of invention it is possible to produce a metal coating in which the above described individual characteristics are better exhibited while the characteristics are balanced well.

A third aspect of the invention in the present patent application is a metal coating in which the arithmetic mean roughness Ra is equal to or less than 100 nm according to the first or second aspect of the present invention. The third aspect of the invention makes it possible to obtain a metal coating in which the surface smoothness and the denseness are further improved by defining the arithmetic mean roughness Ra to be equal to or less than 100 nm.

A fourth aspect of the invention in the present patent application is a metal coating which is set forth in any of the first to third aspects of the present invention and which is formed using a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid that contains a water soluble organic solvent. In the fourth aspect of the present invention by preparing a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid which contains a water soluble organic solvent it is made possible to adjust the viscosity of the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid to fall in a range that is optimal for coating method to be adopted in order to apply the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid onto a surface of a base material. In addition by adjusting the vapor pressure of the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid it is made possible to adjust the speed of drying to be done after coating or the like to the optimum range. Therefore according to the fourth aspect of the invention by baking after applying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid to a surface of a base material it is made possible to form a metal coating in which the film quality is more smooth and dense and which has no void or the like.

A fifth aspect of the invention in the present patent application is a metal coating which is set forth in any of the first to fourth aspects of the present invention and which is formed using a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid having an electric conductivity of 5 mS cm or more. According to the fifth aspect of the invention by defining the electric conductivity of the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid to be 5 mS cm or more thereby suitably controlling the electric repulsive force around the metal nanoparticles it is possible to improve the dispersibility of the metal nanoparticles and the reliability of the dispersion and to form a dense metallic coated film by drying after applying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid to a base material. Therefore in the fourth aspect of the invention by baking the metallic coated film it is made possible to form a metal coating in which the film quality is more smooth and dense and which has no void or the like.

A sixth aspect of the invention in the present patent application is a method of forming a metal coating set forth in any of the first to fifth aspects of the present invention the method comprising a step of applying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid onto a surface of a base material the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid being composed of metal nanoparticles water and a dispersant having a molecular weight of 2000 30000 and having a solid form at room temperature a step of forming a coated film by drying the so applied liquid and a step of forming a metal coating by baking the coated film at a temperature of 700 C. or less.

In the sixth aspect of the invention a coated film is formed by applying and drying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid containing the above described components onto a surface of a base material and thereafter a metal coating is formed by baking the coated film at a temperature of 700 C. or less so as to prevent excessive growth of grain size or generation of a void or the like. Therefore the sixth aspect of the invention makes it possible to obtain a metal coating having superior properties with respect to the above described characteristics.

A seventh aspect of the invention in the present patent application is a metal wiring characterized in that a metal coating that is set forth in any of the first to fifth aspects of the present invention is made by pattern formation. As described herein above in the first to fifth aspects of the invention it is possible to form a metal coating which has not only smooth and dense film quality but also superior properties in terms of adhesion to a base material ease of etching and high conductivity. Therefore according to the seventh aspect of the invention by forming the metal coating in a pattern of minute planar shape in which the thickness is 1 m or less and in which the line width and the line interval are both equal to or less than several tens of m for example it is possible to obtain metal wiring in which the individual micro pattern regions exhibit superior properties with respect to the above mentioned characteristics and which has particularly excellent conductivity.

An eighth aspect of the invention in the present patent application is a metal wiring of the seventh aspect of the invention wherein the metal wiring is formed by etching in pattern formation of the metal coating formed on a base material. In the eighth aspect of the invention since the pattern form is made by etching after a metal coating that can be easily etched has been formed on a base material as explained earlier the metal coating removed by etching can be prevented from remaining between the adjacent metal wirings as residues that have not been completely removed by the etching. Therefore according to the eighth aspect of the invention it is possible to obtain a metal wiring in which there is no possibility of a shortcoming such as the residues causing a short circuit between the adjacent metal wirings.

According to the present invention it is possible to provide a metal coating having small surface roughness and superior in terms of the smoothness and the denseness and having excellent properties for etching and adhesion to a base material to provide a method of forming such metal coating and to provide a metal wiring formed by pattern formation of the metal coating.

A metal coating according to one aspect of the invention is formed by baking after applying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid onto a surface of a base material the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid being composed of metal nanoparticles water and a dispersant having a molecular weight of 2000 30000 and having a solid form at room temperature 5 35 wherein the metal coating comprises an alloy including 1 Ag and 2 at least one kind of metal selected from the group consisting of Au Pt Pd Ru Ir Sn Cu Ni Fe Co Ti and In the content ratio of Ag being 80 99.9 by atomic percent in the total quantity of the alloy and wherein the metal coating has an average grain size of 0.2 5 m. The content ratio of Ag is limited to the above mentioned range because of the following reasons.

That is if the content ratio of Ag in the alloy which forms a metal coating is less than 80 by atomic percent the effect of Ag to afford high conductivity to the metal coating cannot be achieved which results in decrease of conductivity of the metal coating. Also depending on the kind of a metal in 2 above which forms the alloy together with Ag the condition of the metal coating becomes such that it is difficult to perform etching and consequently in the case of forming a metal coating in a shape of metal wiring by etching for example the residues of the metal coating which could not be removed completely by the etching may cause a problem such as a short circuit between adjacent metal wirings.

Also if the content ratio of Ag exceeds 99.9 by atomic percent the content ratio of a metal described in 2 above decreases relatively and consequently in the case of baking the metal fails to achieve the effect of preventing too much growth of the grain size or generation of a void or the effect of restraining the growth of the grain size of Ag or the effect of making a metal coating hardly susceptible to oxidization or the like. Accordingly there occurs a problem that it is impossible to form a metal coating having not only smooth and dense film quality without voids but also superior conductivity.

In order to achieve the above mentioned various effects effectively in a well balanced manner by using both of Ag and a metal mentioned in 2 above the content ratio of Ag in the total quantity of the alloy is more preferably 90 99.9 by atomic percent and most preferably 98 99.9 by atomic percent.

As for the metals of 2 above it is preferable to co use 2 1 a first metal which is at least one kind of metal selected from the group consisting of Au Pt Pd Ru and Ir and which has excellent properties for the function of restraining the grain size growth of Ag and the function of making a metal coating hardly susceptible to oxidization during baking and 2 2 a second metal which is at least one kind of metal selected from the group consisting of Sn Cu Ni Fe Co Ti and In and which is superior in the property of restraining the grain growth of the grain size of Ag during the baking the property of ease in etching and the property of causing itself to be oxidized during the baking so as to improve the adhesive property of the metal coating with respect to the base material which is mainly oxide.

Also in the case of the above mentioned co use preferably the content ratio of the second metal is 0.1 2 by atomic percent and most preferably 0.1 1 by atomic percent in the total quantity of the alloy. Thus it is made possible to cause the above described individual characteristics to be better exhibited while the characteristics are balanced well.

If the content ratio of the second metal is less than the above mentioned range the property of ease in etching and the property of improving the adhesiveness of the metal coating which properties can be obtained by the effect of containing the second metal may not sufficiently be achieved. Reversely if the content ratio of the second metal is more than the above mentioned range the entire metal coating may become susceptible to oxidization resulting in decrease of the conductivity or degradation of the film quality.

The first metal may be contained in the range of the content ratio equivalent to the remaining portion which is obtained by excluding Ag and the second metal from the total quantity of the alloy and most preferably the first metal may be contained in the same content ratio as that of the second metal. Thus by compensating the negative effect of the second metal that is by compensating such negative effect as the entire metal coating becoming susceptible to oxidization resulting in decrease of the conductivity or degradation of the film quality with the effect of the first metal which not only is hardly susceptible to oxidization but also has high heat resistance it is possible to effectively achieve only positive effects of the second metal that is the effect of causing ease in etching and the effect of improving the adhesiveness of the metal coating.

In consideration of affording satisfactory conductivity to a metal coating by decreasing the crystal grain boundary which hinders the conductivity the average grain size of the metal coating is preferably equal to or more than 0.2 m. Also the average grain size of the metal coating is preferably 5 m or less in order to afford satisfactory conductivity by improving the smoothness and denseness of the metal coating and maintaining the smooth and dense conditions at a micro region of individual patterns of metal wiring which is formed by pattern formation into a minute planar shape for example having a thickness of 1 m or less and in which a line width and an interval between adjacent lines are both equal to or less than several tens of m.

Also in consideration of forming a metal coating in which the above mentioned effects are well balanced and which has superior surface smoothness and denseness as well as excellent conductivity more preferably the average grain size of the metal coating is 0.5 3 m.

The thickness of the metal coating may be designed in an arbitrary range according to the use of the metal coating. For example in the case of a metal coating for forming a minute metal wiring in which a line width and a line interval are both equal to or less than several tens of m as described above preferably the metal coating has a thickness of 1 m or less. Also in view of affording satisfactory conductivity to the metal coating by means of Ag the electrical resistivity of the metal coating is preferably 20 cm or less.

In the present invention the metal coating is formed by baking after a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid which includes metal nanoparticles water and a dispersant is applied to a surface of a base material. Therefore the metal coating can be formed more easily with a productive efficiency as compared with the conventional sputtering method or the like. Also as compared with the conventional method employing a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid in which metal nanoparticles are dispersed in an organic solvent it is possible to form a metal coating which is superior in terms of not only smooth and dense film quality but also adhesion to a base material ease of etching and high conductivity.

As for the metal nanoparticles it is possible to use one or more kinds of metal nanoparticles with which a metal coating made of an alloy including the above mentioned compositions can be formed by baking. More specifically one kind of metal nanoparticles consisting of an alloy having the same composition as the metal coating may be used or it is possible to use metal nanoparticles with which an alloy can be formed by baking and in which the content ratio between Ag nanoparticles and one or more kinds of metal nanoparticles consisting of metals mentioned in 2 above are adjusted according to the composition of the alloy.

For the purpose of forming a metal coating which is as dense as possible the particle size of the metal nanoparticles is preferably 200 nm or less and more preferably 150 nm or less for primary particle size. The minimum of primary particle size of the metal nanoparticles is not particularly limited. However from the viewpoint of practical use the primary particle size is preferably 1 nm or more. In the present invention the primary particle size of the metal nanoparticles is defined by the peak value of the particle size distribution which is measured using a particle size distribution measuring instrument utilizing a laser Doppler method.

The metal nanoparticles can be manufactured by a conventional known method such as a hot processing method which is called an impregnation method a liquid phase reduction method and a vapor phase method. In order to manufacture metal nanoparticles by the liquid phase reduction method for example a dispersant and water soluble metallic compounds which are to become metal ions for forming metal nanoparticles are dissolved in water and in addition a reducing agent is added such that preferably while being stirred for a given time ions of both metals may be subjected to reduction reaction. The metallic nanoparticle which is manufactured by the liquid phase reduction method has generally a spherical or granular shape which is characterized in that the particle size distribution is sharp and the primary particle size is small.

The water soluble metallic compounds which become the source of metal ions are for example in the case of Ag silver nitrate I AgNO silver methansulfonic acid CHSOAg etc. and in the case of Au tetrachloroauric acid tetrahydrate HAuCl.4HO etc. In the case of Pt dinitro diammineplatinum II Pt NO3 2 NH3 2 hydrogen hexachloroplatinate hexahydrate H PtCl .6HO etc. can be mentioned as examples and in the case of Pd palladium nitrate II nitric acid solution Pd NO HO palladium chloride II solution PdCl etc. can be mentioned.

Likewise in the case of Ru ruthenium nitrate III solution Ru NO etc. can be named and in the case of Ir indium chloride III IrCl etc. can be named. In the case of Sn tin chloride pentahydrate SnCl 5HO etc. can be named and in the case of Cu copper nitrate II Cu NO copper sulfate pentahydrate CuSO 5HO etc. can be mentioned. In the case of Ni nickel chloride hexahydrate NiCl 6HO nickel nitrate hexahydrate Ni NO 6HO etc. can be mentioned.

The examples in the case of Fe are ferric nitrate hexahydrate nonahydrate Fe NO 6HO.9HO ferric chloride tetrahydrate FeCl 4HO ferric sulphate heptahydrate FeSO 7HO acetylacetone iron III Fe CH COCH etc. In the case of Co cobalt chloride hexahydrate CoCl 6HO cobalt nitrate hexahydrate Co NO .6HO etc. and in the case of Ti titanium chloride III TiCl etc. can be named. In the case of In indium chloride tetrahydrate InCl.4HO indium nitrate trihydrate In NO .3HO etc. can be named.

As for the reducing agent various reducing agents which can precipitate metal nanoparticles by reducing metal ion in a liquid phase reaction system may be used. For example the reducing agents that may be used are sodium borohydride sodium hypophosphite hydrazine and transition metal ion trivalent titanium ion divalent cobalt ion etc. . However it is preferable to select and use a reducing agent having practically weakest reduction power so that the reduction and precipitation rates may be decreased because delaying the reduction of metal ion and decreasing the precipitation rate are effective for the purpose of lessening as much as possible the primary particle size of the metallic nanoparticle to be precipitated.

The reducing agents having weak reduction power are for example alcohols such as methanol ethanol 2 propanol etc. and ascorbic acid ethylene glycol glutathione organic acids citric acid malic acid tartaric acid etc. reducing saccharide glucose galactose mannose fructose sucrose maltose raffinose stachyose etc. and sugar alcohols sorbitol etc. . In particular the reducing saccharides and the derivatives thereof such as the sugar alcohols are preferable.

The dispersants that can be used are various dispersants which can well disperse the extracted metal nanoparticles in water and which have a molecular weight of 2000 30000 a solid form at room temperature and satisfactory solubility relative to water. The dispersant exists surrounding the extracted metal nanoparticles in the reaction system and prevents the agglomeration of the metal nanoparticles performing the function of maintaining the dispersion.

Also the liquid phase reaction system which has precipitated metal nanoparticles can be used as the starting raw material for adjusting the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid in a state where only impurities are removed without separating metal nanoparticles from the reaction system. In such case the dispersant which remains little removed in the process of removing the impurities continues to perform the function of preventing the agglomeration of the metal nanoparticles and maintaining the dispersion as described earlier hereinabove.

If the molecular weight of the dispersant is less than 2000 the dispersant may not be able to sufficiently perform the function of preventing the agglomeration of the metal nanoparticles and maintaining the dispersion. Therefore it may occur that the metal coating which is formed by baking the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid applied onto a surface of a base material fails to have the smooth and dense film quality without a void or the like.

Also the dispersant having a molecular weight exceeding 30000 has a bulk which is too large and consequently may hamper the mutual sintering of the metal nanoparticles thereby causing voids or decreasing the denseness of film quality in the baking process for forming a metal coating. Likewise there may be a shortcoming such that the resolved residues of the macromolecular dispersant remain as impurities in the metal coating thereby decreasing the conductivity of the metal coating.

On the other hand a dispersant having a molecular weight of 2000 30000 is not only superior in the function of dispersing metal nanoparticles in a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid but also has a bulk that is not too large and therefore the dispersant neither causes the metal coating to have a void upon baking nor decreases the denseness of film quality. Moreover the dispersant does not cause any resolved residues to remain in the metal coating the remaining resolved residues may cause the degradation of the conductivity.

In consideration of preventing the degradation of electronic components which will be arranged at the vicinity of the metal coating when the metal coating is used in the electronics field it is preferable that the dispersant do not contain any of sulfur phosphorus boron and halogen atom.

Of dispersants having a polar group including for example macromolecular dispersants of amine type such as polyethylenimine and polyvinyl pyrrolidone macromolecular dispersants of hydrocarbon type such as polyacrylic acid carboxymethylcellulose etc. which have carboxylic acid function in the molecule poval polyvinyl alcohol and interpolymers having a polyethylenimine part and a polyethylene oxide part in one molecule the suitable dispersants that can meet the above mentioned conditions are macromolecular dispersants having a molecular weight of 2000 30000. The dispersant can be added to a reaction system in a liquid state in which the dispersant is dissolved in water or water soluble organic solvent.

In order to adjust the primary particle size of the metal nanoparticles the kind and the combination ratio of a metallic compound a dispersant and a reducing agent may be adjusted and in addition the stirring speed temperature time pH etc. may be adjusted at the time of subjecting the metal compound to reduction reaction. For example the pH of the reaction system is preferably 7 13 in order to form metal nanoparticles having a primary particle size that is as small as possible.

For the purpose of adjusting the pH of the reaction system within the above mentioned range a pH adjusting agent is used. In order to prevent the degradation of an electronic component which will be arranged at the vicinity of the metal coating when the above mentioned metal coating or a metal coating to be formed is used in the electronics field it is preferable to use pH adjusting agents such as nitric acid and ammonia which do not include any impurity elements such as alkali metal alkaline earth metal sulfur phosphorus boron and halogen element such as chlorine.

A metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid may be prepared in a manner such that the metal nanoparticles extracted in a liquid phase reaction system are processed into powder through steps such as filtration washing drying and cracking and thereafter the powder of metal nanoparticles is mixed with water and a dispersant and if necessary further mixed with a water soluble organic solvent at given ratios so as to prepare the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid. However it is preferable that the liquid phase reaction system which has extracted the metal nanoparticles be used as starting raw materials to prepare a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid as described earlier hereinabove.

That is a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid is prepared in a manner in which after treatments such as ultrafiltration centrifuging water washing electrodialysis etc. are performed so as to remove impurities from the liquid phase reaction system that has extracted metal nanoparticles and that includes the metal nanoparticles and the water used for the reaction the concentration of the metal nanoparticles is adjusted by removing water by means of concentration processing or reversely by adding water in accordance with the need and thereafter if needed by further mixing a water soluble organic solvent at a given ratio. This method makes it possible to form a more dense and uniform metal coating by preventing the particles from having irregular shapes due to agglomeration of metal nanoparticles.

The content ratio of water in the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid is preferably 20 400 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of metal nanoparticles. If the content ratio of water is less than such range it may not possible to fully achieve the effect by water of swelling dispersants sufficiently and dispersing the metal nanoparticles surrounded by the dispersant without causing agglomeration in the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid. Also if the content ratio of water exceeds the range the content ratio of the metal nanoparticles in the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid decreases which may result in failure to form a metal coating having sufficient thickness and density on a surface of a base material.

As to the water soluble organic solvent various organic solvents which are soluble in water can be used. The specific examples are as follows alcohols such as methyl alcohol ethyl alcohol n propyl alcohol isopropyl alcohol n butyl alcohol isobutyl alcohol sec butyl alcohol tert butyl alcohol etc. ketone such as acetone methyl ethyl ketone polyalcohol such as glycerine ethylene glycol etc. and ester etc.

The content ratio of the water soluble organic solvent is preferably 30 900 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of metal nanoparticles. If the content ratio of the water soluble organic solvent is less than the range the effect afforded by the organic solvent being contained for enabling the adjustment of the vapor pressure and viscosity of the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid may not sufficiently be achieved. In contrast if the content ratio of the water soluble organic solvent exceeds the range a surplus organic solvent may hamper the water from achieving the effect for swelling the dispersant sufficiently and dispersing well without causing agglomeration the metal nanoparticles surrounded by the dispersant in the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid.

The content ratio of the dispersant is preferably 3 60 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of metal nanoparticles. If the content ratio of the dispersant is less than such range the contained dispersant may not be able to sufficiently achieve the effect of preventing the agglomeration of the metal nanoparticles by existing so as to surround the metal nanoparticles in the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid which includes water. Reversely if the content ratio of the dispersant exceeds the range the shortcomings may be such that the surplus dispersant causes a void or decreases the denseness of the film quality by inhibiting the sintering of metal nanoparticles during the baking process or such that the decomposed residues of the macromolecule dispersant remain as impurities in the metal coating and decrease the conductivity of the metal coating.

The metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid preferably has an electric conductivity of 5 mS cm or more. At the time of forming metal nanoparticles by the liquid phase reduction method the electric conductivity can be changed by adjusting the content ratio of the water soluble organic solvent and the remaining quantity of the impurities such as metal ions and ammonia ions etc. as the pH adjusting agent added to the reaction system the reducing agent and counter ions which have formed metal salt which becomes the sources of metal nanoparticles.

Therefore it is preferable to adjust the electric conductivity by choosing the method and the conditions for the process of removing impurities from the reaction system and by adjusting the concentration for diluting or concentrating the reaction system as well as by adjusting the added amount of the water soluble organic solvent. The electric conductivity of the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid is preferably 100 mS cm or less. If the electric conductivity exceeds such range the impurities will increase and remain in the metal coating after baking which may result in the adverse effects.

The metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid must have a suitable viscosity for a coating method which is applied to coating onto the surface of a substrate. For such purpose the content ratio of the total amount of water and a water soluble organic solvent which occupies in the total quantity of the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid may be adjusted or the molecular weight and the content ratio of the dispersant may be adjusted.

As for the method of forming a metal coating of the present invention first a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid is applied to a surface of a base material. The thickness of the applied layer of the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid is adjusted so as to be able to form a metal coating having a target thickness through the processes of drying and baking after coating. The recommendable coating methods are for example a spin coating method a spray coating method a bar coating method a die coating method a roll coating method and a dip coating method. According to these methods it is possible to make the thickness of the metal coating more uniform because the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid can be applied uniformly to a surface of a base material.

Next a coated film is formed by drying the metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid which has been applied to the surface of the base material. The conditions for the drying are set such that almost all of the water and the water soluble organic solvent can be evaporated. Then a metal coating is formed when the coated film is subjected to baking by heating at a temperature higher than the temperature for the thermal decomposition of the dispersant so that not only can the dispersant be removed by the thermal decomposition but also the metal nanoparticles can be sintered.

The baking may be performed in the atmospheric air in order to subject the dispersant to thermal decomposition and in order to prevent the oxidation of the metal nanoparticles further baking may be performed in a reducing atmosphere after baking in the atmospheric air. The temperature for baking is preferably 700 C. or less and most preferably 250 550 C. from the viewpoint of preventing the excessive growth of the grain size of metal which constitutes the metal coating formed by the baking and the generation of voids in the metal coating.

The metal wiring of the present invention is characterized in that the above mentioned metal coating of the present invention is formed in a predetermined planar shape by pattern formation. The metal wiring can suitably be used for example as wiring and an electrode in a liquid crystal display LCD such as TFT liquid crystal reflection type liquid crystal etc. a plasma display PDP a solar cell a multilayer substrate and so on.

For forming metal wiring the method comprising the following steps can preferably be adopted a step of forming a coated film by applying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid to a surface of a base material and drying the so coated liquid a step of baking the coated film at a pre determined temperature to form a metal coating of the present invention and a step of forming metal wiring by subjecting the metal coating to etching so as to form in a pre determined planar shape by pattern formation in the same manner as in the case of a metal coating prepared by means of a conventional wet plating method. According to the method since it is easy to etch the metal coating of the present invention as explained earlier regardless of any minute planar shape formed by pattern formation no residues of a metal coating which could not completely be removed by etching will remain between adjacent metal wirings. Therefore it is possible to form metal wiring which will not have a shortcoming such as short circuit caused between adjacent metal wirings.

An etching method suitable for pattern formation of a metal coating is an etching technique utilizing photolithography that enables with sufficient reproducibility precise formation of a minute pattern of metal wiring. More specifically a photoresist layer having photosensitivity is formed on a metal coating and the resist layer is exposed and developed so as to form a resist mask for covering a region of the metal coating which region corresponds to the pattern to be formed and thereafter the metal coating portion which is not covered with the resist mask is removed selectively by etching in a predetermined planar shape such that metal wiring is formed by pattern formation. As to the method of etching for removing the metal coating portion which is not covered with the resist mask either a liquid phase method which uses an etching solution or a vapor phase method which uses an etching gas and an ion beam may be adopted in the present invention.

The metal wiring of the present invention may be formed by baking a coated film prepared beforehand by the following manner a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid which contains metallic nanoparticles which are to become a metal coating of the present invention water and a dispersant having a molecular weight of 2000 30000 and having a solid form at room temperature are applied onto a surface of a base material so that a predetermined planar shape of pattern formation may be formed by a printing method such as an ink jet printing dispenser printing or screen printing and thereafter the so applied metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid is dried to make the coated film. Also the metal wiring of the present invention may be formed by the following steps applying a metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid onto a surface of a base material and forming a coated film by drying the so applied metal nanoparticles dispersed liquid and prior to the baking the coated film is formed into a predetermined planar shape of the pattern formation by etching which employs a photolithography method or the like and thereafter the baking is performed.

Moreover the metal wiring of the present invention can be formed by combining the above described forming methods. For example the above mentioned forming method using the ink jet printing may be applied for forming the whole metal wiring in a predetermined planar shape by pattern formation and the minute part can be formed by pattern formation by means of etching using the photolithography.

More specifically after the whole metal wiring pattern including the region which corresponds to the minute part formed as an overall coated pattern is formed by the forming method using the ink jet printing or the like the region of above mentioned overall coated pattern can be shaped into a pattern form by etching using the photolithography or the like. In such case the shaping of the minute part by etching the overall coated pattern may be done at a stage either prior to or after baking the coated film formed by a method using the ink jet printing or the like.

In any of the above mentioned cases since the metal coating of the present invention and the metal nanoparticles which constitute the metal coating can easily be etched there will be no possibility that the residues of the metal coating which could not be removed completely by the etching remain between adjacent metal wirings which constitute the minute part. Therefore it is possible to make metal wiring in which there will be no problem such as the above mentioned residues causing short circuit between the adjacent metal wirings.
