This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 712 821 filed Sep. 1 2005 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety

A portion of this work was funded by the National Institutes of Health under grant numbers U54 CA105008. The government may own certain rights in the present invention.

This invention is directed to a molecular beacon methods and kits for the detection of expression of p21 WAF1 CIP1 in response to chemotherapy. Specifically the introduction of a phosphorothioate modified p21 beacon by transfection in human tumor cells yields increased signal in a dose dependent manner.

Molecular beacons were introduced in the mid 1990 s as novel probes that can fluorescently detect in solution or in living cells nucleic acid synthesis expression or trafficking. The basic structure of molecular beacons includes a stem loop structure with a fluorophore and a quencher at the respective 5 and 3 ends of the molecule. Proximity of the fluorophore to the quencher results in fluorescence resonance energy transfer and quenching of the fluorescence. Upon hybridization of the loop region to a target DNA or RNA in solution or in living cells the fluorophore and quencher become spatially separated resulting in emission of fluorescence. Molecular beacons have been widely used to detect either DNA or RNA in the real time quantitative PCR methodologies. Microinjection of antisense oligonucleotide molecular beacons designed to detect the myb vav protooncogene in human K562 leukemia cells provided evidence for DNA RNA hybridization in living cells.

One of the potential targets for real time in vivo imaging with molecular beacons is the p53 pathway which since dysfunctional in cancer portends a poor patient prognosis and poor response to chemo and radiotherapy. Mutations in the p53 gene are common in human tumors and even when the gene is wild type there are usually other defects resulting in p53 inactivity. Mechanisms of p53 inactivation include accelerated degradation due to MDM2 or human papillomavirus E6 protein cytoplasmic sequestration due to Parc inefficient stabilization due to ARF deletion or mutation or dominant negative isoforms of p53 family members. While detection of p53 mutation in vivo may be potentially useful in prognostication this has proven to be difficult for a variety of reasons.

p53 mutations occur at many different sites primarily within a large central DNA binding domain and while it is possible to detect such mutations with microarray technology this requires DNA isolation. Immunohistochemistry has been used to detect overexpressed p53 protein due to the fact that most mutants have a greatly increased half life. However increased expression of p53 occurs even when p53 is wild type and so this has not been a uniformly reliable method. While there are some antibodies that can distinguish wild type from some mutated epitopes of p53 these methods require at a minimum fixing the cells and therefore cannot be used in living tissue.

In the last decade significant progress has been made in the identification and characterization of the events downstream of p53 activation. Wild type p53 protein is stabilized in response to a variety of cellular stresses including exposure to DNA damaging chemo or radio therapy hypoxia or inappropriate proliferative signals such as oncogene activation. Transcriptional targets of p53 have been linked to its tumor suppressive activities. For example the p53 dependent transcriptional activation of p21 WAF1 CIP1 in response to cellular stress results in cell cycle arrest through inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase activity.Other p53 targets include death receptors such as Fas or KILLER DR5 or other proapoptotic genes such as Puma Noxa Bax Bak Bid or PIDD that either directly or indirectly impact on the mitochondria or caspase activation leading to cell death. The most consistently induced p53 target gene is the p21 WAF1 CIP1 gene being induced during either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis or in all tissues or cell lines examined.

Therefore there is a need to non invasively imaging cellular and molecular events associated with effective chemotherapy and radiotherapy that use p21 WAF1 CIP1 gene.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method of evaluating the efficiency of a cancer chemotherapy in a subject comprising contacting a cancerous cell of said subject with an effective concentration of a molecular beacon comprising an oligonucleotide comprising a stem and a loop structure and having a photoluminescent dye at one of the 5 or 3 ends and a quenching agent at the opposite 3 or 5 ends wherein said loop consists of about 12 25 bases and has a melting temperature T of 52 54 C. and wherein the stem consists of 7 base pairs having a sequence comprising 5 CCAAACCGGTTTGG 3 SEQ ID NO.2 and comparing a detected signal to a control.

This invention relates in one embodiment to a molecular beacon methods and kits for the detection of expression of p21 WAF1 CIP1 in response to chemotherapy. Specifically the introduction of a phosphorothioate modified p21 beacon by transfection in human tumor cells yields increased signal in a dose dependent manner.

Molecular Beacons comprise in one embodiment nucleic acid molecules having a target complementary sequence an affinity pair or nucleic acid arms holding the probe in a closed conformation in the absence of a target nucleic acid sequence and a label pair that interacts when the probe is in a closed conformation. In another embodiment hybridization of the target nucleic acid and the target complementary sequence separates the members of the affinity pair thereby shifting the probe to an open conformation. The shift to the open conformation is detectable in one embodiment due to reduced interaction of the label pair which may be in one embodiment a fluorophore and a quencher e.g. DABCYL and EDANS . Molecular Beacons are fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 925 517 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

According to this aspect of the invention and in one embodiment the invention provides molecular beacon comprising an oligonucleotide comprising a stem and a loop structure and having a photoluminescent dye at one of the 5 or 3 ends and a quenching agent at the opposite 3 or 5 ends wherein said loop consists of about 12 25 bases and has a melting temperature T of 52 54 C. and wherein the stem consists of 7 base pairs having a sequence comprising 5 CCAAACCGGTTTGG 3 SEQ ID NO.2 .

In one embodiment the molecular beacon of the invention comprises a detectable label in the 5 or 3 ends of the stem. The term detectable label refers in one embodiment to a composition or moiety that is detectable by spectroscopic photochemical biochemical immunochemical electromagnetic radiochemical using technetium 99m Tc e.g. or chemical means such as fluorescence chemifluoresence or chemiluminescence or any other appropriate means. In another embodiment detectable labels are fluorescent dye molecules or fluorophores such fluorescein phycoerythrin CY3 CY5 allophycocyanine Texas Red peridenin chlorophyll cyanine FAM JOE TAMRA TET VIC. Methods and compositions for detectably labeling molecules such as oligonucleotides PNA DNA hybrids etc. are well known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 316 230 6 297 016 6 316 610 6 060 240 6 150 107 and 6 028 290 each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

In one embodiment the photoluminescent dye used in the beacons methods and kits of the invention is fluorescein phycoerythrin CY3 CY5 allophycocyanine Texas Red peridenin chlorophyll cyanine FAM JOE TAMRA TET VIC or a combination thereof. In another embodiment the FAM is 6 carboxyfluorescein 6 FAM .

In one embodiment molecular beacon probes according to the present invention utilize any photoluminescent moiety as a detectable moiety. Typically these are dyes. In another embodiment these are fluorescent dyes. Photoluminescence is any process in which a material is excited by radiation such as light in one embodiment is raised to an excited electronic or vibronic state and subsequently re emits that excitation energy as a photon of light. Such processes include in one embodiment fluorescence which denotes emission accompanying descent from an excited state with paired electrons a singlet state or unpaired electrons a triplet state to a lower state with the same multiplicity i.e. a quantum mechanically allowed transition. Photoluminescence includes in another embodiment phosphorescence which denotes emission accompanying descent from an excited triplet or singlet state to a lower state of different multiplicity i.e. a quantum mechanically forbidden transition. Compared to allowed transitions forbidden transitions are associated with relatively longer excited state lifetimes

In one embodiment the molecular beacon of the invention which is used in the methods and kits of the invention comprises a quencher moiety of a detectable label disposed on the opposing end of the detectable label. In another embodiment quencher moiety as used herein means a molecule that in close proximity to a donor fluorophore takes up emission energy generated by the donor and either dissipates the energy as heat or emits light of a longer wavelength than the emission wavelength of the donor. In one embodiment the quencher is considered to be an acceptor fluorophore. The quenching moiety can act in another embodiment via proximal i.e. collisional quenching or by Forster or fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET in other embodiments. Quenching by FRET is used in one embodiment when TAQMAN probes are used while in another embodiment proximal quenching is used in molecular beacon and scorpion type probes.

In one embodiment the molecular beacon used in the invention utilize proximal quenching. In proximal quenching a.k.a. contact or collisional quenching the donor is in close proximity to the quencher moiety such that energy of the donor is transferred to the quencher which dissipates the energy as heat as opposed to a fluorescence emission. In FRET quenching the donor fluorophore transfers its energy to a quencher which releases the energy as fluorescence at a higher wavelength. Proximal quenching requires very close positioning of the donor and quencher moiety while FRET quenching also distance related occurs over a greater distance generally 1 10 nm the energy transfer depending on R.sup. 6 where R is the distance between the donor and the acceptor . Thus when FRET quenching is involved the quenching moiety is an acceptor fluorophore that has an excitation frequency spectrum that overlaps with the donor emission frequency spectrum. When quenching by FRET is employed the assay may detect an increase in donor fluorophore fluorescence resulting from increased distance between the donor and the quencher acceptor fluorophore or a decrease in acceptor fluorophore emission resulting from increased distance between the donor and the quencher acceptor fluorophore . TaqMan probes Heid et al. 1996 use the fluorogenic 5 exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase to measure the amount of target sequences in cDNA samples. TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that contain a donor fluorophore usually at or near the 5 base and a quenching moiety typically at or near the 3 base. The quencher moiety may be a dye such as TAMRA or may be a non fluorescent molecule such as 4 4 dimethylaminophenylazo benzoic acid DABCYL . See Tyagi et al. Nature Biotechnology 16 49 53 1998 . When irradiated the excited fluorescent donor transfers energy to the nearby quenching moiety by FRET rather than fluorescing. Thus the close proximity of the donor and quencher prevents emission of donor fluorescence while the probe is intact.

In one embodiment the kits and methods of the invention use binary molecular beacons. In another embodiment since molecular beacons generate a detectable background fluorescence it is beneficial to validate that fluorescence signals are the result of hybridization of the molecular beacon to the target sequence rather than merely the presence of the probe in the sample. In on embodiment two different molecular beacons with the same loop specificity each possessing a differently colored fluorophore are designed to bind to the same target at nearly adjacent positions so that on hybridization their fluorophores interact via FRET as described herein. In another embodiment since the efficiency of FRET is inversely proportional to the distance between the fluorophores molecular beacons that are bound nonspecifically to the target sequence fluoresce in their own characteristic emission wavelength but do not to participate in the generation of a FRET signal. In one embodiment the donor fluorophore TMR e.g. is placed at the 5 end of one molecular beacon of the invention and the acceptor fluorophore Texas red at the 3 end of the other molecular beacon of the invention to maximize the efficiency of target mediated FRET. The fluorophore bearing arms or stems of these molecular beacons as well as the loop sequences were designed to be complementary to their target sequences. In one embodiment the sequences of the two probes are chosen so that when they both bind to the same target sequence their fluorophores are separated from each other by such number of intervening target nucleotides so that the intensity of the FRET signal is at a maximum optimally balancing the negative effect of mutual fluorescence quenching and the positive effect of resonance energy transfer for these particular fluorophores. In one embodiment the kits of the invention comprise binary molecular beacon system.

Suitable donor fluorophores for use in the molecular beacons kits and methods of the invention include 6 carboxyfluorescein 6FAM tetrachloro 6 carboxyfluorescein TET 2 chloro 7 phenyl 1 4 dichloro 6 carboxyfluorescein VIC and the like. Suitable quenchers include tetra methylcarboxyrhodamine TAMRA 4 4 dimethylaminophenylazo benzoic acid DABCYL or a DABCYL analog and the like. Tetramethylrhodamine TMR or 5 carboxyrhodamine 6G RHD may be combined as donor fluorophores with DABCYL as quencher. Probes for detecting amplified sequence in real time may be stored frozen 10. to 30 C. as 100 M stocks. TaqMan MGB probes are available from Applied BioSystems 4316032 .

Examples of donor acceptor label pairs that may be used in connection with the invention include in one embodiment fluorescein tetramethylrhodamine IAEDANS fluororescein EDANS DABCYL coumarin DABCYL fluorescein fluorescein BODIPY FL BODIPY FL fluorescein DABCYL lucifer yellow DABCYL BODIPY DABCYL eosine DABCYL erythrosine DABCYL tetramethylrhodamine DABCYL Texas Red DABCYL CY5 BH1 CY5 BH2 CY3 BH1 CY3 BH2 6 FAM BHQ1 and fluorescein QSY7 dye. A person holding an ordinary level of skill in the art will understand that when donor and acceptor dyes are different energy transfer can be detected by the appearance of sensitized fluorescence of the acceptor or by quenching of donor fluorescence. When the donor and acceptor species are the same energy can be detected by the resulting fluorescence depolarization. Non fluorescent acceptors such as DABCYL in one embodiment and the QSY 7 dyes in other embodiments advantageously eliminate the potential problem of background fluorescence resulting from direct i.e. non sensitized acceptor excitation. In one embodiment fluorophore moieties that can be used as one member of a donor acceptor pair include fluorescein ROX and the CY dyes such as CY5 . In another embodiment quencher moieties that can be used as another member of a donor acceptor pair include DABCYL and the BLACK HOLE QUENCHER moieties which are available from Biosearch Technologies Inc. Novato Calif. .

In one embodiment the kits and methods of the invention use molecular beacons labeled with colloidal quantum dots. Colloidal quantum dots QDs refer in one embodiment to semiconductor nanocrystals whose photoluminescence emission wavelength is proportional to the size of the crystal. The emission spectra of QDs are narrow which allows multiwavelength labeling with different sizes of QDs with little overlap. QDs outer surfaces is readily conjugated in another embodiment to the molecular beacons of the invention resulting in a spectrum of labels that are all excited with a single wavelength. In another embodiment the QDs used in the invention are CdSe nanocrystals.

In one embodiment in addition to p21 specific molecular beacons the methods and kits of the invention comprise molecular beacons specific for other cancer related genes such as Puma or KILLER DR5 Bax Bid FADD FLIP IAP1 IAP2 Bcl XL Plk2 Caspase 6 Cyclin D Fas ligand TRAIL Caspase 8 Apaf1 p27 in other embodiment.

In one embodiment QDs of different size are used to label the molecular beacons specific for the above mentioned genes or protein encoding genes such that an emmission fingerprint emerges which will identify the presence of any combination of the genes present in the sample. In one embodiment the obtained sample fingerprint is compared with a standard fingerprint of a sample taken from a subject with a given cancer type. In another embodiment emmission spectra library of cancer specific molecular beacons of the invention labeled with the QDs is used to determine the molecular beacon cocktail necessary to diagnose a given cancer type. In one embodiment the kits of the invention comprise cancer specific cocktail of molecular beacons.

In one embodiment the invention provides a molecular beacon oligonucleotide comprising a stem and a loop structure wherein said loop has a sequence complementary to a coding or non coding region of p21 WAF1 CIP1 gene. In another embodiment complementary indicates that the oligonucleotide has a base sequence containing an at least 15 contiguous base region that is at least 70 complementary or in another embodiment at least 80 complementary or in another embodiment at least 90 complementary or in another embodiment 100 complementary to an at least 15 contiguous base region present of p21 WAF1 CIP1 gene sequence excluding RNA and DNA equivalents . Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate modifications that could be made to the hybridization assay conditions at various percentages of complementarity to permit hybridization of the oligonucleotide to the target sequence while preventing unacceptable levels of non specific hybridization. . The degree of complementarity is determined by comparing the order of nucleobases making up the two sequences and does not take into consideration other structural differences which may exist between the two sequences provided the structural differences do not prevent hydrogen bonding with complementary bases. The degree of complementarity between two sequences can also be expressed in terms of the number of base mismatches present in each set of at least 15 contiguous bases being compared which may range from 0 3 base mismatches.

In one embodiment the invention provides a molecular beacon oligonucleotide comprising a stem and a loop structure wherein said loop has a sequence complementary to a coding region of p21 WAF1 CIP1 gene. The term coding region refers in one embodiment to a sequence of a nucleic acid or its complement or a part thereof that can be transcribed and or translated to produce the mRNA for and or the polypeptide or a fragment thereof. IN another embodiment coding sequences include exons in a genomic DNA or immature primary RNA transcripts which are joined together in one embodiment by the cell s biochemical processes providing a mature mRNA. The anti sense strand is the complement of such a nucleic acid and the skilled artisan would readily recognize that the encoding sequence can be deduced therefrom.

In another embodiment the invention provides a molecular beacon oligonucleotide comprising a stem and a loop structure wherein said loop has a sequence complementary to a non coding region of p21 WAF1 CIP1 gene. In one embodiment the term non coding region refers to a sequence of a nucleic acid or its complement or a part thereof that is not transcribed into amino acid in vivo or where tRNA does not interact to place or attempt to place an amino acid in another embodiment. Non coding sequences include in one embodiment both intron sequences in genomic DNA or immature primary RNA transcripts and gene associated sequences such as promoters enhancers silencers etc. in other embodiments.

In one embodiment the invention provides a molecular beacon comprising an oligonucleotide comprising a stem and a loop structure wherein the structure comprises a nuclease resistant backbone.

In one embodiment the sensitivity of cellular imaging and quantification of gene expression using molecular beacons is severely limited by the degradation of oligonucleotide backbone by nucleases. To overcome this difficulty molecular beacons are synthesized in another embodiment with nuclease resistant backbone chemistries such as phosphorothioate in one embodiment or peptide nucleic acid PNA and 2 O methyl modifications in other embodiments. According to this aspect of the invention and in one embodiment the nuclease resistant chemistry used in the beacons methods and kits of the invention comprises phosphorothioate modified backbone.

In one embodiment beacons modified with sugar modified North 3 endo 2 exo conformationally constrained nucleosides or base constraining oxetane OXE modifications oxetane 1 1 3 O anhydro psicofuranosyl nucleosides are used to protect the beacon from nuclease activity by modifying the beacon s backbone. The modifications in another embodiment makes the beacon so modified be delivered to the cells with greater efficiency making resolution of the methods and kits of the invention higher and detection more accurate.

In another embodiment the invention provides a molecular beacon comprising an oligonucleotide comprising a stem and a loop structure and having a photoluminescent dye at one of the 5 or 3 ends and a quenching agent at the opposite 3 or 5 ends wherein said loop consists of about 12 25 bases and wherein said loop has a sequence complementary to a coding or non coding region of p21 WAF1 CIP1 gene.

In one embodiment the p53 gene is inactivated in the majority of human cancers affecting cell division and apoptosis processes. In another embodiment DNA damaging agents induce a p53 dependent G1 arrest that is critical for p53 mediated tumor suppression. In one embodiment following DNA damage cells can either proceed to apoptosis or enter a transient arrest cycle allowing time for DNA repair. p21 gene also known as WAF1 or CIP1 is a key component of this pathway. In one embodiment it is up regulated by activated wild type p53 which acts as a transcription factor. p21 expression results in inhibition of the cyclin dependent kinases Cdks that are essential for cell division. Consequently cell cycle is arrested at the G1 phase until genomic repair is established.

p53 is tightly regulated and its protein level in normal cells is very low. The p53 protein is regulated largely at the posttranslational level through its interaction with MDM2. MDM2 restricts p53 transactivation function by binding to the N terminal domain of p53 mediating ubiquitination and rapid degradation of p53 by proteasomes. In cancer cells mutant p53 loses its transactivation function in one embodiment and does not induce MDM2 gene expression. In another embodiment mutant p53 is not degraded in cancer cells and its half life is prolonged. In one embodiment effective chemotherapy will increase activity of p53 thereby inducing p21 activity. In another embodiment increase in p21 activity is accompanied by cellular concentration of p21 mRNA which is detectable by the beacons methods and kits of the invention.

In one embodiment the beacons used in the invention are sufficiently complimentary to the p21 gene to be detected. Sufficiently complementary refers in one embodiment to a contiguous nucleic acid base sequence that is capable of hybridizing to another base sequence by hydrogen bonding between a series of complementary bases. In another embodiment complementary base sequences may be complementary at each position in the base sequence of an oligonucleotide using standard base pairing e.g. G C A T or A U pairing or may contain one or more residues that are not complementary using standard hydrogen bonding including abasic nucleotides but in which the entire complementary base sequence is capable of specifically hybridizing with another base sequence under appropriate hybridization conditions. Contiguous bases are at least about 80 in one embodiment or at least about 90 in another embodiment or about 100 complementary to a sequence to which an oligonucleotide is intended to specifically hybridize in another embodiment. Appropriate hybridization conditions are well known to those skilled in the art can be predicted readily based on base sequence composition or can be determined empirically by using routine testing e.g. See Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual 2.sup.nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 .

In another embodiment the invention provides a molecular beacon comprising an oligonucleotide comprising a stem and a loop structure and having a photoluminescent dye at one of the 5 or 3 ends and a quenching agent at the opposite 3 or 5 ends wherein said loop consists of about 12 25 bases and has a melting temperature T of 52 54 C. and wherein the stem consists of 7 base pairs having a sequence comprising 5 CCAAACCGGTTTGG 3 SEQ ID NO.2 wherein the loop has a sequence complementary to the third exon of the p21 WAF1 CIP1 gene. In another embodiment that sequence comprises 5 GTC TAA AGA TGG TGA 3 SEQ ID NO.3 .

In one embodiment the tendency of molecular beacons to shuttle into the nucleus soon after they entered the cell directed the identification of the intron exon boundaries in the mRNA and direct the target sequence to be contained only in the third exon.

In one embodiment the invention provides a method of evaluating the efficiency of cancer chemotherapy in a subject comprising contacting a tumor cells of said subject with an effective concentration of the molecular beacon comprising an oligonucleotide comprising a stem and a loop structure and having a photoluminescent dye at one of the 5 or 3 ends and a quenching agent at the opposite 3 or 5 ends wherein said loop consists of about 12 25 bases and has a melting temperature T of 52 54 C. and wherein the stem consists of 7 base pairs having a sequence comprising 5 CCAAACCGGTTTGG 3 SEQ ID NO.2 and comparing detected signal to a control.

In another embodiment the effective concentration of the molecular beacon is between about 5 and 50 nM or in another embodiment between about 50 and 100 nM or in another embodiment between about 100 and 150 nM or in another embodiment between about 150 and 200 nM or in another embodiment between about 200 and 250 nM or in another embodiment between about 250 and 300 nM or in another embodiment between about 300 and 350 nM or in another embodiment between about 350 and 400 nM. In one embodiment the effective concentration of the molecular beacon used in the methods of the invention is 200 nM.

A person skilled in the art would recognize that the effective concentration of the molecular beacons used in the methods and kits of the invention could be altered to yield an optimal signal to noise response based on the source of cancerous cell and the particular purpose for which it is being used all without departing from the scope of the invention.

In one embodiment the amplified target sequence is complementary to the sequence of p21 WAF1 CIP1 which in another embodiment will comprise 5 GTC TAA AGA TGG TGA 3 SEQ ID NO.3 .

In one embodiment the term amplification or amplify refers to one or more methods known in the art for copying a target nucleic acid thereby increasing the number of copies of a selected nucleic acid sequence. Amplification may be exponential in one embodiment or linear in another. In one embodiment a target nucleic acid may be either DNA or RNA. The sequences amplified in this manner form an amplicon. While the exemplary embodiments described herein relate to amplification using the polymerase chain reaction PCR numerous other methods are known in the art for amplification of nucleic acids e.g. isothermal methods rolling circle methods etc. and are considered within the scope of the present invention. The skilled artisan will understand that these other methods may be used either in place of or together with PCR methods. See e.g. Saiki Amplification of Genomic DNA in PCR Protocols Innis et al. Eds. Academic Press San Diego Calif. 1990 pp 13 20 Wharam et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001 Jun. 1 29 11 E54 E54 Hafner et al. Biotechniques 2001 April 30 4 852 6 858 860 passim Zhong et al. Biotechniques 2001 April 30 4 852 6 858 860.

In another embodiment real time PCR is used in the methods of the invention. The term real time PCR refers in one embodiment to the process where a signal emitted from the PCR assay is monitored during the reaction as an indicator of amplicon production during each PCR amplification cycle i.e. in real time as opposed to conventional PCR methods in which an assay signal is detected at the endpoint of the PCR reaction. Real time PCR is based in one embodiment on the detection and quantitation of a fluorescent reporter. The signal increases in direct proportion to the amount of PCR product in a reaction. By recording the amount of fluorescence emission at each cycle it is possible to monitor the PCR reaction during exponential phase where the first significant increase in the amount of PCR product correlates to the initial amount of target template. For a general description of real time PCR see Dehe et al. J. Virol. Meth. 102 37 51 2002 and Aldea et al. J. Clin. Microbiol. 40 1060 1062 2002 referring to the LightCycler where real time kinetic quantification allows measurements to be made during the log linear phase of a PCR .

In another embodiment molecular beacons specific for the p53 gene are used as part of the methods and kits of the invention wherein samples are split and the detectable signal from the bound molecular beacon or labeled p53 specific antibody which could either be monoclonal or polyclonal antibody or a fragment thereof F ab e.g. is compared with a sample following digestion with an endonuclease. In one embodiment the more efficient the chemotherapy the higher will be the p53 activation.

In one embodiment the cells used for the methods of the invention are obtained from a sample given by the subject. The sample to be analyzed may consist in one embodiment of or comprise blood sera urine feces epidermal sample skin sample cheek swab sperm amniotic fluid cultured cells bone marrow sample and or chorionic villi and the like. A biological sample may be processed in another embodiment to release or otherwise make available a nucleic acid for detection as described herein. Such processing may include in one embodiment steps of nucleic acid manipulation e.g. preparing a cDNA by reverse transcription of RNA from the biological sample. Thus the nucleic acid to be amplified in one embodiment by the methods of the invention may be DNA or RNA.

The following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention. They should in no way be construed however as limiting the broad scope of the invention.

p21 antisense oligonucleotides ordered from GeneLink Hawthorne N.Y. contained the sequence is 5 CCAAACCGTCTAAAGATGGTGAGGTTTGG 3 SEQ ID NO.1 . 6 FAM was attached to the 5 end and BHQ1 to the 3 end. For stability the oligonucleotide was constructed using a phosphorothiolated backbone. The antisense beacon was developed from human p21 mRNA sequence accession number NM000389 . The beacon was resuspended in TE buffer and stored in the dark at 20 degrees Celsius. A more detailed explanation of molecular beacon design can be found at www.molecular beacons.org.

H460 is a human non small cell lung cancer cell line that expresses wild type p53 and p21.H460 cells were grown in RPMI media containing 10 fetal bovine serum FBS and 1 penicillin and streptomycin PS . HCT116 is a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line that expresses wild type p53 and p21.p21 null HCT116 cells have been previously described.HCT116 cells were grown in McCoy s 5A media with 10 FBS and 1 PS. P53 null HCT116 and mutant p53 expressing DLD1 human colon carcinoma and p21 null DLD1 derivatives have been previously described.DLD1 cells were grown in Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Media with 10 FBS and 1 PS. To induce expression of p21 cells were treated with 0.2 micrograms mL of Adriamycin.

Cells were grown to 90 confluency in six well plates and transfected using 4 microL of Lipofectamine 2000 obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies Inc. Carlsbad Calif. . Increasing concentrations of beacon was added to each well to achieve final concentrations ranging between 0 and 400 nM. Transfections were carried out in serum free media for four hours and a period of 24 hours passed before cells were treated with Adriamycin.

Living cells were detected using a Zeiss AxioVert inverted microscope Carl Zeiss Inc. at 40 magnification. Green fluorescence was visualized by exciting at 470 nm with a mercury arc lamp and emissions were detected with a 515 nm long pass filter.

A series of tests were carried out to develop a chemotherapy inducible molecular beacon. This represents the first attempt whose intent was to understand the technology in order to improve it for in vivo use. In the present studies a beacon was generated which detects p21 gene activation in living tumor cells exposed to the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. The results indicate that liberation of fluorescence from a phosphorothioate modified p21 molecular beacon occurs in chemotherapy treated cells. Insights are provided regarding the design specificity background and p53 dependence of chemotherapy induced p21 beacon activation. The present studies help in improving design for accelerating the rate at which beacon cocktails are derived to begin providing prognostic information in the clinic.

In designing a molecular beacon two factors were considered. First the target sequence on the mRNA of interest had to be designed such that it would be easily accessible by the probe and second the beacon needed to be stable within the cell. Secondary structure of the human p21 mRNA was visualized using the MFOLD server and this resulted in several unrelated possible structures . Using a p21 target sequence used in antisense studies a region of hybridization was identified. In light of this the intron exon boundaries in the mRNA were identified and target sequence to be contained were designed only in the third exon. Anticipating that the beacon would be encountering mostly unprocessed RNA in the nucleus a target sequence involving two adjacent exon sequences was avoided.

After a potential target sequence was identified the beacon was designed. Starting with a random sequence of nucleotides for the stem structure the probe was analyzed using the MFOLD server for both secondary structure and melting temperature. Melting temperature was determined by altering the GC content of the stem structure as well as adjusting the overall length of the hybridization sequence. Because the half life of most beacons upon entrance into mammalian cells is less than 15 minutes a phosphorothioate backbone was incorporated into the design. This backbone increases the half life of beacons to a period of 2 days. The final p21 beacon design included the hybridization sequence in the loop structure and had a melting temperature of 53.3 degrees Celsius .

The synthetic human p21 beacon was transfected at different concentrations into confluent six well plates containing H460 human lung cancer cells. After 24 hours the cells were treated with doxorubicin Adriamycin and examined for a change in fluorescent signal. At a 50 nM concentration of p21 beacon there was a low signal both before and after treatment but there was a detectable increase in fluorescence after doxorubicin exposure . As can be seen in a final concentration of 200 nM of p21 beacon provided the best intensification of signal after doxorubicin exposure as compared to untreated cells. After 8 hours of drug treatment a significant change in fluorescent signal was observed due to the induction of p21 by doxorubicin. When the p21 beacon concentration was increased to 400 nM it was difficult to distinguish between untreated and treated cells . The concentration of beacon was too high which resulted in an increase in the non specific background signal. Cells were also visualized under the same conditions without the addition of beacon a final concentration of 0 nM and there was no signal both in the presence or absence of adriamycin treatment. These results indicate that a drug induced response is detected with a p21 beacon in a beacon dose dependent manner. The concentration of p21 beacon required for optimal detection of signal following doxorubicin exposure was 200 nM. This was apparently enough in H460 cells to provide a large signal upon p21 induction without high background fluorescence.

p21 Beacon Activation in Chemotherapy Exposed Wild Type p53 Expressing HCT116 Colon Cancer Cells that are Either Wild Type or Null for p21

The specificity of the p21 beacon on p21 gene sequence was examined using HCT116 human colon cancer cells that express wild type p53 and p21 as well as p21 null HCT116 cells. Both cell types were transfected with different concentrations of p21 beacon. At 50 nM the background signal between both wild type and p21 null cells were similar. After drug treatment fluorescence was induced in both cell types and an increase in signal was seen even in the p21 null cell line . At a higher concentration of 150 nM beacon signal was observed in both wild type and p21 null cells although there appeared to be a somewhat higher induction in the wild type p21 expressing cells . The bright background was evident in the cytoplasm and appeared to move into the nucleus after doxorubicin treatment suggesting that the drug somehow facilitated a shuttling of the oligonucleotide through the nuclear membrane. This same observation was evident in cells with a 400 nM final concentration of beacon the signal was transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after drug treatment . More overall background was present at this higher concentration but the increase in signal was maintained in both wild type and p21 null cells. There results indicated that there was activation of p21 beacon following chemotherapy exposure that was independent of p21 gene sequence. Endonuclease activation may contribute to the observed induction in fluorescence.

p21 Beacon Activation in Chemotherapy Exposed p53 Null HCT116 Colon Cancer Cells or Mutant p53 Expressing DLD1 Colon Cancer Cells that are Either Wild Type or Null for p21

The question of whether p21 activation following doxorubicin exposure might be affected by cells expressing wild type p53 or were p53 deficient was examined. Transfection of p53 null HCT116 cells did not produce a concentration dependent increase in green fluorescence. Cells treated with both 200 nM and 400 nM p21 beacon showed a similar background and minimal increase in fluorescence after doxorubicin . The p53 null cell line had little cytoplasmic background and only a few cells exhibited an intense signal after doxorubicin treatment. Mutant p53 expressing DLD1 human colon cancer cells showed a similar result between 150 nM and 400 nM concentrations of p21 beacon . Both wild type and p21 null DLD1 cells contained a small amount of cytoplasmic background signal. Interestingly the amount of signal in the cells appeared to decrease slightly after incubation with doxorubicin for eight hours. These results were consistent between both concentrations of p21 beacon. These results show that doxorubicin induced activation of the human p21 beacon occurred due to a p53 dependent DNA damage response leading to both p21 gene activation and p53 dependent endonuclease activation.
