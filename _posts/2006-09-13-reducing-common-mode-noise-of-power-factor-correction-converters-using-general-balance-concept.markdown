title: Reducing common mode noise of power factor correction converters using general balance concept
abstract: Common mode (CM) noise is substantially canceled in a switching power supply circuit such as a boost converter by providing a split inductor and analyzing the switching power supply circuit as a bridge circuit formed of the switch, portions of the split inductor and parasitic capacitances of respective portions of the power supply circuit. The bridge can then be balanced by addition of capacitance in parallel with the parasitic capacitance of a respective portion of the power supply circuit or dividing the split inductor such that a ratio of inductances of respective portions of the split inductor approximates a ratio of parasitic capacitances of the respective power supply circuit portions which may be measured or otherwise empirically determined. CM noise reduction of up to 40 db can be achieved without symmetric circuit design, addition of circuit elements or complex filtering having added cost, space requirements and power losses. Further, such a reduction in common mode noise allows simple EMI filtering arrangements to be employed further reducing cost and space requirements for the power supply circuit.

This invention was made in connection with National Science Foundation Contract EEC 9731677. The U. S. Government may have certain rights in this invention.

The present invention generally relates to power supplies and power factor correction power converters and more particularly to reduction of common mode CM noise produced therein.

Most electronic devices currently in use operate on a more or less constant voltage direct current DC power rather than alternating current AC generally used for power distribution. This voltage is generally produced by a power supply or power converter included in such electronic devices which may include an AC to DC power supply such as a rectifier and filter and a further regulator stage to stabilize the output voltage at a desired value. It is also common if not required to provide an arrangement for correction of power factor and electromagnetic interference EMI filtering.

To improve efficiency of the voltage regulator generally included in electronic devices a switching arrangement is often used to control the voltage developed at the output since an ideal switch does not consume power in the on or off state while significant power is dissipated by any regulating element or circuit which functions as a variable impedance in the current path since a voltage drop will always exist across it while significant current levels are provided through it. In some designs such as alternators or for boosting the output voltage above the voltage supplied by a power source switching is indispensable.

However use of a switching arrangement is a source of common mode CM noise due to the unavoidable voltage variation dv dt which results from the power switching function and the unavoidable parasitic capacitance between the power circuit and ground. CM noise is thus very difficult to control particularly due to the parasitic capacitance between respective portions of the power circuit and the case the circuit board other circuits and the like which are subject to unpredictable variation from slight changes in geometry and proximity to various structures. Attempts to reduce CM noise have generally been attempted through strict symmetric design which is not always compatible with requirements of the powered circuit and often requires additional components which may be unnecessary for any other reason or through intensive filtering which also compromises efficiency and is often expensive and consumes significant space. Even so reduction in CM noise has generally been limited to about 20 db which is insufficient to allow simplification or reduction in size and weight of EMI filtering arrangements.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a technique for substantial cancellation of common mode noise which is simple inexpensive and of low volume and capable of providing as high as a 40 db reduction of common mode CM noise and which is sufficient to allow simplification of EMI filtering and without requiring a performance penalty such as loss of efficiency.

In order to accomplish these and other objects of the invention a power supply circuit is provided comprising an inductor configured in two portions a switch controlling conduction through said inductor circuit portions having respective parasitic capacitances and means for approximately balancing currents in said two portions of said inductor.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention a method of cancelling common mode noise in a power supply circuit including a switch is provided including steps of determining parasitic capacitances of circuit portions forming respective portions of a bridge network in combination with the switch and respective portions of an inductor and approximately balancing the bridge network.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to there is shown a schematic circuit diagram of a boost power factor correction converter but without an input rectifier bridge or other power input arrangement being illustrated since the nature of the power input is irrelevant to an understanding of the invention and principles thereof sufficient to its practice of a general type to which the invention is particularly applicable. The voltage boost circuit of will also enable the application of the principles of the invention to other types of power supplies and converters such as DC to DC converters dual boost PFC converters and inverters forward converters flyback converters or any other power circuit topologies. Further it should be understood that since and the equivalent circuit model of are arranged to facilitate an understanding of the basic principles of common mode CM noise and its causes no portion of either Figure is admitted to be prior art in regard to the present invention even though the invention is not specifically depicted therein but could be considered as being illustrated therein as will be evident from the discussion of below.

The circuit of includes a switch K comprising a field effect transistor e.g. a MOSFET and diode an internal diode of the transistor a boost capacitor C boost inductor L diode D output capacitor Cand a load R. As is known when switch Kis turned on the input voltage is added to the inductor L and the current is built up. When switch Kis turned off the current in inductor Lturns on diode D and then charges the output capacitor Cand thus provides current to load R. The desired output voltage Vo can therefore be built up by current in L. The 50 Ohm resistors illustrated correspond to the impedance of line impedance stabilization networks LISNS which are used to measure the noise.

The major parasitic parameters affecting common mode noise are C the parasitic capacitance between the drain of switch Kand ground and C the total parasitic capacitance from the load side including the parasitic capacitance of any printed circuit board which is usually employed or other circuit structure and ground between the load and ground and between the cathode output of diode D and ground.

In the circuit of the switch Kcan be considered as the noise source Vas depicted in . Similarly the parallel 50 Ohm resistors corresponding to the LISNs may be represented by a 25 Ohm resistor Ras illustrated in . Omitting the rectifier filter and load circuit as being largely irrelevant to the CM noise generation other than by reason of the parasitic capacitances they impose represented by Cand C the circuit of can be simplified and modeled as the equivalent circuit illustrated in .

It is evident and should be noted from that CM noise currents Iand Iflow to ground with opposite directions through the parasitic capacitors Cand Cbecause of the different potentials on opposite sides of noise source V. Thus the CM noise current Iflowing through the LISNs and evaluated as the voltage drop across the parallel 50 Ohm impedances is the difference of Iand Iand thus to reduce CM noise Ishould be as small as possible. The basic principle of the invention is thus to reduce Iby balancing Iand Ito cause Iapproach zero or under ideal conditions equal to zero as will now be discussed in connection with .

It will be recognized that is identical to but for the addition of capacitors Cand Cillustrated with dashed lines and the splitting of boost inductor into two coupled portions Land L. Thus applying the circuit simplifications discussed above the simplified equivalent circuit of is shown in which can be considered as a Wheatstone bridge. Thus if the bridge is balanced Iis zero. A balanced condition will be achieved when the equation 1 is satisfied which can be achieved in several ways.

For example one method of satisfying Equation 1 is to make L Land C C C C which can be realized in practice by accurate splitting of the inductor and adding a balancing capacitor for either Cor C or both . Another method would be to omit Cand Cbut to make L L C Cwhich can be realized in practice by appropriate proportional splitting of the inductor in accordance with a measured or otherwise empirically determined ratio of parasitic capacitances. It should be noted that in either case coupling of the split portions of the inductor increases the balance of parasitics at high frequencies.

The efficacy of the invention to achieve substantial cancellation of CM noise is illustrated in . While it is difficult in practice to precisely satisfy Equation 1 above achieving a sufficient balance to provide much greater CM noise reduction than has heretofore been achieved with filters or symmetrical circuit designs is not particularly critical or difficult to achieve particularly when high coupling coefficient is exhibited between the inductor portions e.g. split windings which enhances balancing of inductor parasitics such as winding capacitance and loss as noted above.

The experimental data illustrated in was obtained using a boost converter with a switching frequency of 200 KHZ with a turns ratio of the split inductors of 2 1 Cof 16 pf Cof 46 pf and a 7 pf capacitor in parallel with Cto meet the balance conditions so that the ratio of C C the parallel capacitor is 46 23 or 2 1. In the upper trace is the measured CM noise of the original converter without any noise cancellation measures in accordance with the invention being taken. The lower trace in represents the measured CM noise using the second method of satisfying equation 1 discussed above where the inductance is divided to approximately match the proportionality of the parasitic capacitances and without adding additional balancing capacitance.

It can be observed from that the balancing of noise currents in accordance with the invention as described above produces a substantial reduction of CM noise 10 db to 45 db below the original noise. Moreover it can be clearly observed from that the noise reduction tends to exhibit greater improvement at higher frequencies due to the improved balancing of parasitics at higher frequencies noted above. Thus the current trend toward increased switching frequency for reasons unrelated to the present invention can be exploited in accordance with the invention to provide substantial cancellation of common mode noise.

In view of the foregoing it is clearly seen that the invention provides for substantial cancellation of common mode noise without significant criticality or requirement for precision components. More importantly exploitation of balancing of impedance ratios in accordance with Wheatstone bridge theory avoids the much more critical and burdensome constraint of symmetrical circuit design and allows omission of components such as a diode which would be necessary to achieve symmetric circuit design while achieving improved noise cancellation performance while reducing cost size and power loss.

It should also be appreciated especially since a 40 db reduction in noise corresponds to a factor of 100 that a very low CM noise level can be achieved at low cost and possibly no additional circuit elements and without any size penalty as is presented by approaches which involve filtering or strict symmetry of physical design and moreover the increased reduction in CM noise allows smaller and more simple EMI filtering to be employed actually reducing cost and size of converters and inverters to which the invention may be applied.

While the invention has been described in terms of a single preferred embodiment those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
