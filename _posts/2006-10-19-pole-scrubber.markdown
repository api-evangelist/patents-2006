The present disclosure relates to cleaning devices and more specifically to an adjustable pole mounted scrubber.

Various powered cleaning devices are known in the art. Typical powered cleaning devices include scrubbers with an electric motor driving a brush. However many scrubbing devices have several shortcomings in that they are not readily portable easily adjustable and or ergonomic. For example scrubbing devices with fixed dimensions and fixed scrubbing attachments may not be adaptable for use in some cleaning operations.

In one form the teachings of the present disclosure provide a scrubbing device. The scrubbing device can include a support member a battery a yoke and a head assembly. The yoke is coupled to the support member and has a yoke arm which is coupled to the head assembly. A cam lock releasably couples the yoke arm and the head assembly together. The head assembly has an electric motor that is coupled to the battery and an output member driven by the electric motor and coupled to a scrubbing accessory.

In another form the teachings of the present disclosure provide a scrubbing device having a cam lock where the cam lock further includes a lock member and a lever. The lock member has a first end and a second end opposite the first end with the first end engaged to a head assembly and the second end extending through a yoke arm. The lever has a cam that is pivotally coupled to the second end of the lock member.

In yet another form the teachings of the present disclosure provide a scrubbing device that can have a cam lock that has a coupling aperture formed through the cam wherein the center of the coupling aperture is offset so that a distance from a first side to the center is greater than a distance from a second side to the center. A pin is received through the coupling aperture and engages a lock member.

The scrubbing device can also have a cam lock with a cam that includes a first cam portion and a second cam portion. Engagement of the first cam portion inhibits relative rotation between a head assembly and a yoke while engagement of the second cam portion permits relative rotation between the head assembly and the yoke.

In still another form the teachings of the present disclosure provide a scrubbing device with a head assembly that includes a detent member disposed within a detent passage the detent passage formed in an output member. The detent member is movable between a first detent position and a second detent position radially outwardly of the first detent position. A release ring is disposed coaxially about at least a portion of the output member. The release ring has a first ring portion configured to maintain the detent member at or inwardly of the first detent position and a second ring portion configured to permit the detent member to travel radially outwardly from the first detent position to the second detent position.

In yet another form the teachings of the present disclosure provide methods of adjusting a scrubbing device where the scrubbing device includes a support member a battery a yoke with a yoke arm the yoke coupled to the support member a head assembly with an electric motor and output member a cam lock having a lever a lock member and a latch and an accessory coupled to the output member. The lever is pivoted relative to the lock member to disengage the lock member from the latch. The head assembly can then be pivoted relative to the yoke. The lever is then pivoted relative to the lock member to engage the lock member to the latch in so doing relative rotation between the head assembly and the yoke is inhibited.

In another form the teachings of the present disclosure provide an accessory having a connector portion and an accessory portion. The connector portion further includes a drive portion with a non circular shape disposed about a rotational axis and a retaining portion having a groove formed about the perimeter of the non circular shape. The accessory portion is coupled to the connector portion and includes an accessory member selected from a group consisting of pads brushes sponges and combinations thereof.

Further areas of applicability and advantages will become apparent from the following description. It should be understood that the description and specific examples while exemplifying various aspects of the invention are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

An exemplary scrubbing device constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure is shown in . The scrubbing device can include a housing assembly a support structure a yoke a head assembly and an accessory . The housing assembly can be located on one end of the support structure and the yoke on the other end of the support structure . A battery can be disposed within the housing assembly for powering a motor assembly disposed within the head assembly . A cam lock can be used to couple the yoke to the head assembly . The accessory can be a scrubbing accessory and is coupled to the head assembly such that the accessory can be driven by the motor assembly .

The cam lock can be operated in a first condition which permits the head assembly to pivot relative to the yoke and a second condition that locks the head assembly relative to the yoke . This permits the head assembly of the scrubbing device to be readily adjustably fixed to desired angles between the head assembly and the yoke or allows the head assembly to pivot freely relative to the yoke .

With additional reference to the housing assembly can include first and second clamshells and respectively a cap a switch mount a switch a first seal member a second seal member and the battery . The first and second clamshells can define a housing structure that can have an interior cavity and a handle . The interior cavity can be sized to receive the battery and a wire harness WH. The wire harness WH can be employed to electrically couple the battery to the switch and the motor assembly .

The battery can be any type of battery cell such as nickel cadmium nickel metal hydride lithium ion or alkaline battery and can be permanently or removably received into the interior cavity . As will be appreciated the battery can further include a rechargeable battery or a replaceable disposable battery and a terminal block not shown can be employed to electrically couple the battery to the wiring harness. For example the battery can be a FIRESTORM HPB14 14.4V or HPB18 18V battery pack marketed by Black Decker Corporation of Towson Md. In the example provided a spring not shown is disposed between the housing structure and the battery pack and biases the battery pack in a direction outwardly from the interior cavity . The connection of the battery pack to the wire harness not shown is outside the scope of this disclosure but can employ a terminal block as those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate. An exemplary battery pack terminal block interface is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 329 788 which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in detail herein.

The cap can include a cap handle and first connector portion . The housing structure can further include a shoulder a second connector portion and the first seal member which can be an o ring or a rubber disc that can be affixed e.g. permanently to the cap . The cap can be coupled to the housing structure by placing the cap over the interior cavity so that the first connector portion can be translated past the second connector portion and thereafter rotated to lockingly engage the first connector portion to the second connector portion and sealingly abut the cap against the first seal member and the first seal member against the shoulder . The cap handle can be employed to turn the cap by a predetermined amount such as about 90 in a predetermined rotational direction relative to the housing structure . It will be appreciated that although the first and second connector portions and are illustrated to be helical thread like structures that matingly engage one another various other types of coupling means can be employed in the alternative. For example the cover could be hingedly coupled to the housing structure .

With reference to a first coupling portion can be employed to couple the housing structure to the support structure . The first coupling portion can include an aperture which can extend through the handle and a plurality of bosses that can extend inwardly from one or both of the first and second clamshells . The aperture can be configured to matingly receive a portion of the support structure . The bosses can be received through the support structure and can be employed to secure the first and second clamshells to one another in an appropriate manner such as threaded fasteners for example.

The handle can be disposed between the battery and the switch mount and can be generally cylindrical in shape. The switch mount can be employed to house the switch and can form a guard that can extend around the switch to resist inadvertent actuation of the switch . The switch can be any type of switch including a sealed or water resistant switch and can be employed to selectively control the transmission of electrical energy from the battery to the motor assembly . The second seal member can be employed to seal the interface between the housing assembly and the support structure . In the particular example provided the second seal member is an o ring that is located within the aperture in the housing structure and which sealing engages the support structure and the housing structure .

The support structure can be a one piece structure that can connect the housing assembly to the yoke . In the example provided however the support structure includes a support member that can include a tubular body and a second coupling portion that can be engaged to the first coupling portion of the housing structure to thereby couple the support structure to the housing assembly . In the particular example provided the second coupling portion includes a shaft portion and a plurality of through holes . The shaft portion is sized to be received in the aperture of the housing structure and the through holes are sized to receive the bosses to thereby non rotatably couple the support member to the housing assembly .

A second handle H can also be included on the support structure . The second handle H can be placed on the support structure on a side of the center of gravity of the scrubbing device opposite the housing assembly . Positioning the handle and the second handle in this manner provides improved balance when the scrubbing device is grasped with both handles.

With reference to and the yoke can include a yoke collar first and second yoke arms and respectively an outer cover a first yoke seal a spacer a second yoke seal an intermediate wire harness and a fastener .

With specific reference to the yoke collar can include a body and a stem . The body can have an annular wall member and a flange that extends radially outwardly from the annular wall member on a side opposite the stem . The annular wall member can be formed with a threaded outside diameter and can define a yoke arm aperture and a collar fastener aperture . The stem can be coupled to the body and can be sized to be received into an end of the support structure opposite the handle . In the particular example provided the stem is also an electrical connector that can facilitate electrical connection of the wire harness WH to the intermediate wire harness .

The first yoke arm can include a body portion and a first arm member . The body portion can be sized to be slidingly received into the yoke arm aperture and can include a first body portion and a second body portion . The first body portion can be generally cylindrically shaped and can include a seal groove and a fastener aperture . The second body portion can have a shape that conforms to the outer surface of the first body portion and can form a shoulder where the second body portion abuts the first arm member . A wire harness bore can be formed through the body portion . The wire harness bore can include a grommet bore which can extend through the first body portion and an opening that can be defined by the second body portion . The first arm member can be integrally formed with the body portion and can have a one half U shape that is configured to wrap around a portion of the head assembly .

The second yoke arm can include a mating body portion and a second arm member that can be mirror images of the second body portion and the first arm member respectively except as noted. Accordingly it will be appreciated that the mating body portion can have an exterior surface that is complementary to the exterior surface of the second body portion and that the second arm member can have a one half U shape that can wrap about a side of the head assembly opposite the first arm member . The second arm member can define a lever locking feature such as a recess and or a tab and a pin passage . The pin passage can extend through the second arm member on a side opposite the mating body portion in a direction that is generally perpendicular to the lever locking feature e.g. the recess and the tab . In the particular example provided the first and second arm members and include a plurality of screw bosses that can be employed to fixedly but removably couple the first and second yoke arms and to one another via a plurality of threaded fasteners not shown . Such coupling means are well known in the art and as such a detailed description of this coupling means need not be provided herein.

The intermediate wire harness can extend through the wire harness bore in the first yoke arm and can include a plurality of wires a first grommet and a second grommet . The wires can be electrically coupled to the wire harness WH and to the head assembly . In the particular example provided the wires are coupled to electrical terminals that are mounted in the stem of the yoke collar . The electrical terminals are configured to matingly engage mating terminals that are associated with a mating connector C that is electrically coupled to the wire harness WH. It will be appreciated that the mating connector C can be sealingly engaged to the support member . The first grommet can be received in the grommet bore and can sealingly engage the first body portion and the wires .

The first yoke seal which can be an O ring can be received into the seal groove . The yoke can be inserted into the yoke collar such that the body portion and the mating body portion are received into the yoke arm aperture the first yoke seal sealingly engages the annular wall member the fastener aperture is aligned to the collar fastener aperture and the shoulders defined by the second body portion and the mating body portion can be abutted against the flange . The fastener can be received through the collar fastener aperture and engage the body portion to fixedly couple the first yoke arm and the yoke collar . It will be appreciated that the first yoke seal and the first grommet can form a water resistant seal that inhibits fluids and debris from entering the interior of the pole scrubber through the first yoke arm or the interface between the first yoke arm and the yoke collar .

The outer cover can be disposed about a portion of the end of the support member and can threadably engage the threaded outside diameter of the yoke collar . The outer cover can cover the fastener to thereby inhibit its removal from the yoke collar . The second yoke seal can be disposed between the outer cover and the support member to render the coupling between the yoke and support structure water resistant. The spacer can abut the second yoke seal and the yoke collar and can maintain the second yoke seal in sealing engagement with the outer cover and support structure . It will be appreciated that the outer cover the spacer and the second yoke seal can be associated with and coupled to the support member so as to remain with the support member if the support structure is separated from the yoke collar . It will also be appreciated that the yoke collar and the support member can be keyed to one another in any appropriate manner to facilitate electrical connection of the terminals and in a desired manner.

In the particular example provided the capability to separate the support structure from the yoke collar permits additional support members e.g. support members and to be disposed between the yoke collar and the support member to thereby extend the overall length of the support structure . In this regard each of the support members and can include a tubular body with a first end which can electrically engage the connector C and threadably engage the outer cover to thereby fixedly but removably electrically couple the support members and a second end that can electrically engage the stem of the yoke collar and sealingly and threadably engage the body of the yoke collar . As one of skill in the art will appreciate from this disclosure the first end can be configured to mimic the portion of the yoke collar that was described above as being engaged to the support member and the second end can be configured to mimic the portion of the support member that was described above as being engaged to the yoke collar . Those of skill in the art will further appreciate that the first and second ends and can be electrically coupled to one another through any appropriate means such as a wire harness not shown that is disposed within the tubular body.

The cam lock can include a lever a cam a lock member a retaining pin and a latch or pin receptacle . The lever can define a tab aperture and can be fixedly coupled e.g. integrally formed with to the cam . The tab aperture can be sized to receive the tab while the lever can be sized to be received in the recess in a particular orientation. The cam can be generally U shaped with a pair of arm members . A retaining pin aperture can be formed through the distal ends of the arm members . The lock member can include a circular head portion and a pin portion that is concentric with the circular head portion . The pin portion can be received through the pin passage in the second yoke arm . An aperture can be formed through the pin portion generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the lock member . The retaining pin can be disposed through the retaining pin apertures in the cam and the aperture in the pin portion to pivotally couple the cam and the lever to the lock member . The pin receptacle can be fixedly coupled to the head assembly and can define first and second body members and that are fixedly coupled to one another. The first body member can be disposed adjacent the head assembly and can define a first U shaped slot . The second body member can be abutted against the first body member on a side opposite the head assembly and can define a second U shaped slot that can be narrower and shorter than the first U shaped slot . The circular head portion can be received into the first U shaped slot and the pin portion can extend outwardly through the second U shaped slot . It will be appreciated that the first body member can be relatively thicker than the circular head portion to provide lateral clearance for the circular head portion that can permit the lock member to rotate within the pin receptacle .

As illustrated in the lever of the cam lock can be pivoted between a first position shown in solid line proximate to the second yoke arm and a second or change position shown in phantom line radially outwardly of the first position . When the lever is in the first position the cam can engage the outboard face of the second yoke arm to draw the lock member outwardly from the pin receptacle . It will be appreciated that the second arm member can deflect somewhat i.e. like a spring when the lever is in the first position to exert a force that is applied through the cam to the lock member and the pin receptacle . Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate from this disclosure that the cam could be configured to generate a force that is sufficient to tightly draw the circular head portion against the second body member to thereby inhibit rotation between the lock member and the pin receptacle . In contrast when the lever is positioned in the second position the cam can disengage the outboard face of the second yoke arm to permit the circular head portion to disengage the second body member to thereby permit relative rotation between the lock member and the second arm member . Accordingly those of skill in the art will appreciate that the lever can be moved to the second position to permit the head assembly to be rotated to a desired position and the lever can thereafter be moved to the first position to secure the head assembly in the desired position. Additional functionality of the cam lock is described in more detail below.

The lever can at least partially fit within the lever receiving pocket of the first yoke arm and the tab can be received into the tab aperture when the lever is positioned in the first position. It will be appreciated that the disposition of the lever in the lever receiving pocket helps to inhibit rotation of the lever relative to the second yoke arm . It will be further appreciated that the disposition of the tab in the tab aperture can also help to inhibit rotation of the lever relative to the second yoke arm .

With reference to the cam can includes a first cam portion and a second cam portion . The first cam portion can be configured to develop a first force that is sufficient to clamp the circular head portion of the lock member to the second body member of the pin receptacle when the lever is positioned in the first position and the first cam portion is abutted against the outboard face of the second yoke arm to thereby lock the head assembly relative to the yoke . As noted above the head assembly may be selectively fixed in a given position relative to the yoke .

When the lever is pivoted outward to the second position the lever and cam can be rotated about the longitudinal axis of the lock member to align the second cam portion to the second yoke arm i.e. so that the second cam portion will abut the outboard face when the lever is returned to the first position . The second cam portion can be configured such that a second force which has a magnitude that is less than a magnitude of the first force is generated when the lever is positioned in the first position and the second cam face is abutted against the outboard face . The second force can be light enough to permit the head assembly to pivot e.g. freely or with some resistance relative to the yoke .

In this regard the center of the coupling aperture in the cam can be offset such that the distance from the center to the first cam portion on one side of the cam is greater than the distance from the center to the second cam portion on the other side of the cam . Consequently placing the lever in the first position proximate to the second yoke arm can either engage the cam lock and fix the head assembly relative to the yoke when the first cam portion faces and abuts the outboard face or can allow the head assembly to freely pivot relative to the yoke assembly when the second cam portion faces and abuts the outboard face depending upon which of the first and second cam portions and is engaged against the outboard face .

Returning to the first yoke arm can be pivotably coupled to the head assembly by using a cam lock as described for the second yoke arm or by suitable coupling methods known in the art. Typically the coupling of the first yoke arm to the head assembly is by a pin that rotatably couples the first yoke arm to the head assembly . In this manner only the cam lock that is associated with the second yoke arm need be operated to lock or pivot the head assembly relative to the yoke . Those of skill in the art will appreciate that the pin could be a discrete component as shown or could be integrally formed with one of the first yoke arm and the head assembly and could engage a hole not shown that is formed in the other one of the first yoke arm and the head assembly .

With reference to the head assembly can include a housing the motor assembly which can have an output shaft and an output member . The housing can be a two piece clam shell type construction that is sealed to prevent water from entering the head assembly and contacting the motor assembly . The motor assembly can include an electric motor not specifically shown and a transmission not shown that can have a planetary gearset gearcase and seals not shown which are sealed into a single integral unit. Such motor assemblies are well known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 978 999 entitled Motorized Scrub Brush With Multiple Hand Holding Positions the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in detail herein .

With additional reference to the output member can be coupled for rotation with the output shaft and can include a hub portion with a plurality of detent passages a groove a flange portion a shaft portion and a output shaft engagement aperture a plurality of detent members a release ring having a first ring portion and a second ring portion a spring a washer and a retaining ring .

The detent passage extends radially outwardly through the hub portion of the output member while the flange portion extends circumferentially outward from one end of the hub portion . The shaft portion can extend along a rotational axis A and can form the output shaft engagement aperture . In the particular example provided the output shaft engagement aperture is threaded to receive a threaded end of the output shaft . Alternatively the output shaft engagement aperture could be formed with flat sides not shown and the output shaft could be shaped as a flat fir tree that is forced into the output shaft engagement aperture .

The hub portion can define an accessory connector aperture that can have a shape that can receive a shaft portion of an accessory and transmit drive torque therebetween. In this regard the accessory connector aperture can have a non circular shape such as a hex shape. The detent passages can intersect the accessory connector aperture .

The detent members which can be spherical balls can be received in the detent passages . The spring can be disposed about the hub and abutted against the flange portion . The release ring can received over the hub and abutted against the spring which biases the release ring away from the flange portion . The washer and the retaining ring can be employed to limit the distance by which the release ring is positioned away from the flange portion by the spring . In its normal position which is illustrated in the spring can position the release ring such that the first ring portion which can be generally cylindrically shaped and sized to approximately match the outside diameters of the hub can be located radially in line with the detent member . Accordingly the first ring portion can be employed to maintain the detent members in a first or radially inward location where it is positioned in the accessory connector aperture .

The release ring may be manually moved in a direction parallel to the rotational axis A to align the second ring portion to the detent members . In the particular example provided the second ring portion is radially outwardly tapered from the first ring portion and as such movement of the release ring toward the flange portion by a sufficient distance will permit the detent members to translate radially outwardly to a second position so that it does not extend into the accessory connector aperture .

The accessory can include an accessory portion shown as a brush and the accessory connector having the drive portion and a retaining portion . The retaining portion is shown as a circumferential detent that is formed about the perimeter of the drive portion . The drive portion can be sized and shaped to fit within the accessory connector aperture . In the particular example provided the drive portion has a hex shaped outer surface which slidingly engages the accessory connector aperture and an aperture that is sized to receive the shaft portion therein. The retaining portion can be configured to cooperate with the detent members to fixedly but releasably couple the accessory to the hub portion . In the particular example provided the retaining portion is a groove that extends about the circumference of the drive portion having a generally circular cross sectional shape that is configured to receive the detent members when the drive portion is inserted into the accessory connector aperture . The retaining portion provides space in a radially inwardly direction for the detent members when the detent members are urged radially inwardly by the first ring portion of the release ring .

The accessory can be coupled to the head assembly by urging the release ring against the spring that disposed between the release ring and the flange portion of the output member . This moves the first ring portion of the release ring away from the detent members and brings the second ring portion of the release ring towards the detent members . The second ring portion permits the detent members to move from a first detent position generally radially outwardly in the detent passage to a second detent position. The drive portion of the accessory connector is then disposed between the hub portion and the shaft portion of the output member unobstructed by the detent members . Once the retaining portion of the accessory connector is aligned with the detent passage the spring is allowed to return the release ring to its original position with the first ring portion of the release ring moving the detent member from the second position back to the first position where the detent members engage the retaining portion of the accessory connector thereby retaining the accessory coupled to the head assembly .

Alternative features can be incorporated into various aspects of the scrubbing device as disclosed. Non limiting examples of various accessory portions include pads brushes sponges and combinations thereof. In addition various features of the present disclosure can be made water resistant such that the pole scrubber can be operated in wet conditions or even submerged. Furthermore various motorized drive actions can be employed for powering the accessory including rotary orbital and reciprocating drives. Alternatively a yoke with a single yoke arm can be used.

The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and thus variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.
